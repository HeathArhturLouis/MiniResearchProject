 This book was such a chore to read, I gave up after 50 pages. I agree with the reviewer that said the characters were unlikable. They were so unlikable you won't even want to read what happens to them. 
 I could only read an hour of this. I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I can't recomend this book 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
 the articles are "good" but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point. Too many annoying ads. If u want something to "read" this isnt the magazine for yo 
 I have had this smoker since August and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it. I noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless.   The other problem I have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed.  Dealing with Charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless.  At the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered I would pass for something better 
 There is a review further down this page that is purportedly written by the author. If this was indeed written by the author, he should be profoundly ashamed of himself.  This is what Michael Burleigh has written in the review below in regards to the criticism offered by one of his readers:   "In cyberspace every moron gets a coconut. One big electronic democracy? Many of my US readers appear to need dictionaries. People don't in the fifteen European countries my work is translated into. Nor did I as I wrote the English language. My book is about Europe. Maybe try living there before you presume to comment on it?"  This is one American who has no intention of putting any money in the pocket of someone who holds me and my fellow countrymen in such open and unbridled contempt. And you have to shake your head at the effrontery of the author as he rates his own book with 5 stars 
 In this award-winning novel for young people, all the black people (with possibly one exception) are honest, kind, hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and good looking.  All the white people (with one or two exceptions) are cruel, dishonest, malevolent red-necks, who persecute the "colored people" for no reason at all.  Historically, there's some truth to the setting and events, and we all admit that blacks were sometimes persecuted in the past.  But that was then.  This is now.  Times have changed, but young people are still required to read this one-sided tripe.  Let's hope that English teachers will eventually recognize this poorly written novel for what it is. 
 My husband and I purchased this set with my first son, but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son.  The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks, sometimes more than that.  It is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling.  I hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings 
 This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator 
 The camera has all of the features you could want:  - Shoots great video - Excepts 4GB SD cards - Can record in D1 resolution @ 30fps (I confirmed it with my video editing software) - USB recharge (or AC adapter) all included! - TV output - LED lights (yes, they are actually useful). - Digital photos are actually good.  - 3x optical zoom   The videos are really nice, but keep in mind, these are not meant to replace professional of more expensive camcorders. The videos in sunlight are very good. Low light shots are not as good, but not the worst when you compare it with other offerings. Just be sure you have at least 60 watts of light. Compare the video with other camcorder hybrids at under $200, you can't beat this one. There is no indication of how much space or minutes you have left to shoot. Its annoying, but if you buy a 2GB SD card, the camera will run out of batteries before you run out of space. The LED lights are in fact useful. Don't except them to light up the room. Its not because the light is not bright enough, its because the lights create a small patch of light. Hey, its better then nothing. The sound is nice and clear, not muffled like the other model, the  IS-DV2 model.   But here comes the biggest issue... The LOUD noisy focusing. I'm not talking about the zooming feature (has 3x optics), i'm talking about when you move the camera to a new subject. The camera is constantly and consistently auto-focuses when anything changes in the view of the lens, but it makes such a loud noise that the MIC picks it up. It ruins the video. Unless if your at a rock concert, your going to be hearing scratching noises throughout your video. And yes, it is that LOUD to be distracting. It makes a scratching like noise. The camera takes a few seconds to focus, but every time you move it slightly, or your subjects move, the camera tries to focus again, and it makes that scratching sound. I believe its because the MIC is so sensitive, it picks up the vibrating mechanical focusing unit in the lens. There is no option to "lock" the focus. Had they done that, that would have at least remedy the issue somewhat. Aiptek should have resolved this issue even before manufacturing it. If I were the CEO/President of the company, I would be very embarrassed. I understand these are "cheap" cameras, but at $200 their not exactly cheap in price. They should have at least fixed the loud focus issue before selling it.   I really liked the MZ-DV features, I thought I could live with the focusing noise. But every single video I shot had that annoying noise, so I ended up returning it.   I would avoid this model until Aiptek releases a better model, or replaces the noisy mechanical focus. The other model, which is the same as the MZ-DV, except it has a lower megapixel rating, the Aiptek Zoom DV, has the same focus noise issue. So I would avoid that model also. 
 The Affluent Society is no longer relevant to contemporary economics.  It was written in 1958, when the world was mired in the Cold War.  Not only is this book irrelevant, it is also elitist and arrogant.  Galbraith says that people who belied Karl Marx were inherently more intelligent.  I think it is about time to stop calling an irrelevant book a classic 
 I am at a loss to explain the five-star reviews of this book.  It is one of the most poorly written history books I have ever read.  Sentences and facts are constantly qualified, as if the author is afraid to state a fact or opinion.  The thoughts and flow are poorly organized, which the author attempts to correct by using long compound sentences.  Frequent reference is made to other works with nothing more, like "the Slavs ate green cheese, although some of it wasn't green and one must consider the arguments of Miakovsky in that regard".  I was very excited to get a history of Russia, especially concerning the earlier periods, as I enjoy reading history and had just finished a good work on medieval Europe (@400 AD - 1200  AD).  I really wanted to follow the connected tribal migrations and religious history to the east for the same period.  I was sorely disappointed in my purchase and put it down after 100 pages.  I suggest you look elsewhere for Russian history 
 I have tried (and tried) to get the Fulci cult.  I don't.  This man's films are wretched.  They make no sense, they are so ridiculously cheap, the dialogue is horrendous (in both the English dub and the original Italian version), and the acting is atrocious.  However, they are rather nasty in their gore.  You do remember it in all of his films.  Here, it's acid getting poured on someone's face, a man's face being eaten by tarantulas, and the usual zombies getting their brains splattered everywhere.  The ending is a bit surreal (which I usually like endings like that), but I don't know whether it was intentional or just an accident because of lazy, incompetent filmmaking.  I have seen many Fulci films, including House by the Cemetary, Cat in the Brain, New York Ripper, etc..  I saw this one twice.  The first time was with a friend, and she wouldn't shut up during it, commenting on how bad it was.  So I rented it again, and it was as bad as she said it was.  I even watched the original Italian version with English subtitles, and it was still awful.  People swear Fulci's a genius.  You can see his influence on many horror films today, with their emphasis on gore, incoherency, underdeveloped storylines, junk dialogue, and bad acting.  I read that Lucio was originally a comedy director in Italy, and he worked with Toto the Clown, one of the most famous clowns/actors in Italy during his heyday.  Supposedly, those films were really good.  I would like to see them.  They have to be better than this stuff....         
 If you are not into the family bed and other theories of Dr. Sears, this is not the book for you. This book didn't do anything for me. There are other approaches that seem more interesting, for example the ones described  by Dr. William A.H. Sammons. Dr. Sears and his wife views are certainly not  for everybody 
 I completely taught myself to read and write Armenian and I started with this book. Let me say that it is ok for a reference grammar but if you want to learn the language, get a real textbook like "Practical Textbook of Western Armenian" by Haroutiun Kurkjian which I highly reccomend. Instead of swamping you with grammar like Andonian he gives no grammar rules but guides you through learning grammar in stories. He starts with a graduated approach to the alphabet, and by the end you are reading Armenian literature and there are tapes available although the tapes are hard to understand(old) as well as expensive. However, if you want the most extensive and, in my opinion, the best there is, get Modern Western Armenian, by Thomas Samuelian volumes 1 and 2. Volume 2 is a dictionary that has a lot of useful information in it so get it if even if you already have a dictionary. I'm warning you though, you can get bogged down with the extensive exercises and contextualisations that make the text so great. I reccomend both books for a well-rounded study and Andonian just as a reference... 
 Read: "The Austrian-Jewish Mind". 95% of the men reviewed in this volume were Jews. Austria in the early 20th boils down to three strands of history: the fall of the Dual Monarchy, the Jews of Vienna -- and Austrians. You will not find anything about real Austrians in this book. 
 I purchased this to replace a lost holster.  The first time I tried to place the 7290 in the case, it split at the seams 
 Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred 
 Once upon a time, I could not recommend this book highly enough.  That's the problem--"once upon a time".  In 2004, this book violates what I consider an overriding consideration for instruction books: Never distract the new user with picky details that s/he'll will rarely need in practice.  The first few chapters are written using INPUT and DATALINES; commands to enter data.  For those unfamiliar with SAS, that means the authors enter all of their data as lines of text typed inside their command language.  No one works that way any more! It's a hold over from the days of punchcards.  Does the new user really need to know that  INPUT  ID 1-3 AGE 4-5 GENDER $6; means "look in columns 1-3 for a numerical id, columns 4-5 for numerical age, and column 6 for a character designating gender"?  When the 4-th edition was written, the answer might have been yes, but even then it would have been given grudgingly.  For more than a few years, data almost always arrive as data sets that have already been made into SAS files or as spreadsheets that can be imported directly into SAS.  This method of data input would not be a fatal flaw if the material were in a later chapter or an appendix, but it's woven throughout the text starting with the first example on page 3.  I would love to see this book updated with a more modern view to how data are processed and analyzed, but I can no longer recommend it in its current form.  Added in edit:  Instead, get a copy of "The Little SAS Book: A Primer, Third Edition" by Lora D. Delwiche and Susan J. Slaughter.  If I ever get around to reviewing it, I'll give it 4 or 5 stars. In the meantime, there are already a bunch of reviews you can read on the book's own Amazon web page, mostly good, a few bad, for an average of 4 stars 
 I had previously read and enjoyed (I think) two of Logsdon's earlier books, At Nature's Pace and The Contrary Farmer, but I was barely able to get through this more recent contribution.  Logsdon is clearly  knowledgeable about a wide range of small farming and gardening practices.   There is much useful information in this book, particularly on mulching  garden beds, growing small grains, and using chickens in movable cages for  fertilization and insect control.  However, acquiring this information,  which is also available elsewhere, is a painful experience.  On almost  every page the defects in Logsdon's writing and thinking stand out.  He  makes absurd generalizations and broad pronouncements, on all sorts of  topics, based on what is clearly cursory, limited understanding of the  subjects.  A fine example of the latter is to be found in the last two  pages of the book, where he discusses the evolution of monarch and viceroy  butterflies, and the mimicry of the former by the latter.  His reasoning in  the course of making arguments is often nearly incomprehensible, and time  after time made me shake my head in disbelief.  One example (p. 126):  "I do not believe in letting nature take its course all the time.  In  a world where one ethnic group of Rwandans hacked a million of another  ethnic group to death with machetes recently, I don't have the time nor the  luxury to debate whether I should kill a feral cat that is endangering a  rare species of songbird.  To make the point clearly [!], if I were a  judge, I could sentence a vicious human criminal to death under the  law--with fewer qualms than I feel when killing a poor dumb pest animal,  which is merely the victim of a situation that is as much my fault, as a  human, as the animal's fault.  But in either case I would act, not lie down  passively and let someone else make the decision.  If this sounds  unconscionably brutal to you, try arguing the passive-resistance viewpoint  with a brood of termites under or house or a panther eying up your  child."  I just can't follow this.  Other, shorter instances abound,  as Logsdon draws from his misunderstanding and fractional knowledge of  history, ecology, evolutionary biology, and other areas to offer up his  opinions on government, economics, sociology, religion, and so on.  His  writing is also marred by pointless and foolish parenthetical asides, and  corniness, as when in the space of three pages in the last chapter he  refers six times to his wife as "my lovely" (e.g., "My  lovely found what appeared..."). Other readers seem to enjoy Logsdon's  self-proclaimed stance as "the contrary farmer," and I am  certainly on the same side as he in the struggle against destructive  agribusiness and the global hegemony of ruthless corporations, but  (obviously) I cannot recommend this book, which is poorly written and seems  not to have had the attention of an editor 
 Well intentioned, and a good overview.... for 1999.  The web and the world have changed substantially since the book was published 
 The press on this book indicated it was written with charm and wit.  Unfortunately it did not live up to that notice.  The author is pedantic and takes himself and his subject much too seriously 
 Ryuichi Sakamoto's credibility is on the precipice with Chasm, a turgid unlistenable work of crud. Check out Coro and Only Love Can Conquer Hate, both sound like factory machinery at work. Dire, dreadful and diabolical. Stop being the artiste Ryuichi and have a go at entertaining. Your fans deserve better 
 Doesn't even sound like U2.  We have some of the other albums by Rockabye Baby, and were very disappointed.  Would not recommend 
 Dragonheart did not need a sequel. The story was told. It is over. The first movie peaked therfore, end of franchise. This has bad acting, terrible C.G.I., and stupid story. Stick with the first 
 Terry Pratchett is wonderful and I own everything he's ever written (or co-written)(well, not everything - I don't have his shopping lists). My fanhood began at a time when his non-Discworld books were not available in the US. It was in the bibliography darn it...finally found it via a used-books site reference to a bemused London 2nd-hand bookseller's place (his e-mail: "Are you sure?"). Paid triple the cover price plus shipping, so yes, I trust you recognize a fanatic here?   In addition, I much prefer cats over all other possible pets. I even like Jolliffe cartoons.   If anyone was ever more prejudiced in favor of a book before opening it...  It has its hilarious moments - I don't think Terry (may I call you Terry? Thank you, PS, great stuff, keep it up) could write an obituary without having a hilarious moment or two - but I found the majority of the writing cumbersome. Belabored. Shorn of repetitions and needless build-ups, this would make a wonderful humor column, but book-length, it suffers.   It was detrimentally inaccurate about cats. Well, it wasn't supposed to be a textbook. But, for example, the whole chapter about domestic cats being into time-travel loses a lot of punch when you know that there are plenty of wild feline species (about a quarter of them) that are small and domestic-looking. Making the argument that there's no sensible link between a cat and a lion (as opposed to between a dog and a wolf) is egregious. And there are other errors like that, which detract from the jokes by undermining their premises.  I've read the book three times over the years, thinking maybe it was just a Mood Thing, but I've yet to come away feeling like it was worth wading through all that for the laughs. My suspicion is that Terry really loves his wife and didn't exercise the same level of constructive criticism on her text that he did on himself (as with his rewrite of "Carpet People"). Or maybe Lyn is the really funny one and she forgave Terry too much? Either way, I'd say this is his weakest work (yes, I've read "Strata," too).                
 I have been slogging through this book for weeks now, it was a terrible shock to the system after John Julius Norwich's excellent book on Byzantium.  The book lacks any narrative thrust, often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another.  The one consistent thing throughout this book is the author's obvious agenda to "set the record straight" and prove that the Ottoman empire was far superior to its "barbaric" European contemporaries 
 What in the world happened with this clunker?  You have a script from Oscar winning writer John Patrick Shanley (Moonstruck); a cast any director would die for; and an initially interesting premise.  But even with all that, THE JANUARY MAN is not a good movie.  Shanley's script is so disjointed and the only attempt at comedy seems to be Kline's physical confrontation with the killer.  It takes the movie at least thirty minutes to focus on the killings, and even then, it plods along.  Shanley may have tried to hard to force the genres to work, and it shows.  And director Pat O'Connor should be required to do community service for his mishandling of this talented cast.  Kevin Kline, usually a strong presence in any film, plays Nick Starkey like it was an After School special--bland, unfocused and murky.  Susan Sarandon, who has won an Oscar, tries to be a kind of Julia Roberts femme fatale, but she's about as seductive as a seahorse.  Rod Steiger and Danny Aiello overact so badly, it's hard to believe these gentlemen have given us such good work in the past.  Harvey Keitel needs to play villains if this is how he chooses to embody a "good guy" for a change.  Alan Rickman's Ed is stereotypical artiste, but he at least adds some needed color to the movie.  And Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio is pathetically dull and lethargic. THE JANUARY MAN could have been a good thriller, but under O'Connor's awful direction and Shanley's poorly developed script, it merely becomes one of those classic examples of a good movie gone bad 
 After really enjoying the Amici Forever album, I went shopping for another Amici album and found this one.  There really is no comparison between the two.  I've tried listening to it several times to see if I'm missing something, but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the Lawrence Welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe. I was very disappointed 
 "The WD Passport hard drive requires a little over 1000mA of power at spin up" says the WD troubleshooting website.  Why no mention of that here or on its product page? My usb drive provides 500mA so I need another cable. Extra cost and extra delay. What cheek.   I advise you to check what power your usb port provides before ordering this.   
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 I know others have found this a good resource but I found it very dry and tedious to read.  I returned the book 
 Blue Murder were John Sykes (vox/G), Tony Franklin + Carmine Appice and were, in essence, a project put together to take advantage of the short term high profile Sykes had after his association with David Coverdales Whitesnake. Backed by the seemingly unstoppable (at the time) Geffen, produced by Bob Rock and with John Kalodner lurking around this album had just about everything going fot it. Yet it utterly failed to ignite and the reasons may well include;  *  A annoying treble heavy mix that's distracting to the listener on an average stereo and downright painful via headphones. *  Overly long songs. They wouldn't of fired if they were four minutes long so why drag them out for six minutes?  But it's not all bad. John Sykes sings well enough in an over extended way. And the players are skilled and worthy plus Valley of the Kings is lumbering - but in this instance in a good way.  2.5 stars on a good day. But these guys have all played on better albums 
 I had read Mendelbaum, and I'd read Scott Miller, and yes, even the Banfield Sondheim book, so when I finally got an Ethan Mordden book for Christmas, I was hoping that this famous chronicler of the musical would have something new and interesting. Unfortunately, if there is anything new or interesting about Mordden's writing, it's not likely found in this unstructured, sometimes incoherant book. He presents his often off-the-wall opinions as facts, and I feel sorry for anyone picking up this for the first time and thinking that it should be taken at face value. (Is Marie Christine, the show that even Audra McDonald couldn't save, really the most important new show in 25 years? And why is the heartbreaking and beautiful Floyd Collins dismissed in a paragraph as "not as good as Violet"?)  Furthermore, Mordden insults his audience so much as being stupider than him that the factual and textual errors are absolutely unforgivable. Example: Twyla Tharp's dance show "Movin' Out" is called, incorrectly, "Movin' On" not once but TWICE on the SAME PAGE. I guess you're not as smart as you thought, huh, Ethan?  Overall, I'd steer anyone looking for a decent chronicle of musicals away from this book, especially if you are not already well-read on the subject. Perhaps Mordden's other books are better, but I probably won't buy any after this load of rubbish. Try Ken Mendelbaum, who actually respects the art form and his audience.. For all our sakes 
 There are certain guaranteed signals that a movie sucks. Look for these words and/or phrases      THE RETURN OF....

 Richard, there must be more info in all the research that you did.  I thought you would pick up where Anthony Sommers left off.  Hoovers faults were taken rather lightly instead of showing what an evil person he was-probably the most flagrant violator of civil rights this country has ever seen.  I do give you credit for the fact you did bring up-if you didn't tow his line , you were ostrasized.  His crime fighting skills were vastly overrated 
 The first plot arc includes investigation of cop who made a bad decision and then tried too late to amend it.  The episodes completing this arc were not on the disc.  Ever tried to contact manufacturers to replace faulty discs?  Buyer beware 
 This guy's message is how to limit yourself.  There are plenty of opportunities out there all you have to do is look.  Why struggle to make a bad employment situation better. Life is to short to to pay attention to nonsense like this.  I tried to rate this junk with less than one star but was prohibited from doing so 
 Changing Minds is very disappointing - average to very poor writing, poor development of ideas, ideas that have been shown to be weak or invalid constructs, and very little substance.  You will learn very little about how to change anyone's mind or your own.  Reading this book and finishing it is a grind 
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
 This gets 1 star for the simple fact that it doesn't seem to fit my Mark II body properly. 
 The book was interresting but  I find it interesting that the club referred to in the book is ony for peopole making 6 figures.Do they realy need the basic exercises that are in this book? I thought this was for people fresh out of school or those choosing careers far from their area of experience 
 Fresh Horses, on paper, would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script. You had Molly Ringwald, with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red-blonde hair. You had Andrew McCarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through. You had a romantic triangle. You had the "class divide". The Brat Pack was loved by millions. How could this fail?   The problem really does seem to come down to the actors themselves. There's very little "energy" at all to this story which is supposedly about passion overcoming logic. Molly is a 16 yr old girl in rural Kentucky. When her stepfather begins fondling her, and her mother does little to help, Molly tries for the only escape she can find - marrying the older bad-man-in-town, Viggo Mortensen. She claims she never slept with Viggo - only used him for escape. Then Viggo's father began fondling her, and now she wants out of this house as well.   To get momentary relief from her homelife, she hangs out at a friend's home, which is a 24 hour party. Here she runs into Andrew. Andrew is a very serious student who has just gotten engaged to his high-class, wealthy girlfriend. The girlfriend rambles on and on about china patterns, having children and living the perfect life. Andrew goes with the flow until he sees Molly - and is instantly in lust. Molly leads him to believe she's 20, single, and interested in him. It takes maybe 3 days before he's sleeping with her. To his credit, he does tell his fiancee promptly, and breaks off the engagement.   You'd think everything was wonderful now, right? However, Andrew learns from friends about Molly's lies. He decides to keep seeing her anyway. However, he doesn't want to introduce her to his family, and has no intention of marrying her. He says he loves her - but his feelings seem to be more related to sex. At one point he even gives her a wad of cash to buy her off.   There's a telling scene near the end when Andrew thinks Molly has been publicly stripped by her husband. Andrew storms off to their house to have a talk with Viggo. Andrew is deliberately rude - laughing at Viggo's artwork and putting him down. But it's Viggo who is the calm one here. When Molly shows up, Viggo points out that Molly's been doing all this lying and scheming so that Andrew would be a Knight in Shining Armor and ride off with her. He asks Andrew - if you're saying I'm not good enough for her - it seems that you think you're too good for her, right? Andrew finds himself agreeing - that he won't take on Molly himself. He wants to get Molly away from Viggo, but then is going to abandon her to her own means. How could he figure that Molly would be better off with nobody at all, vs with Viggo?   Fast forward to a year later, and Molly has in fact found herself a "wealthy college boy" to take care of her and is taking classes again. She's happy, and Andrew is sad. I suppose you have to give them credit for a not-typical Hollywood ending to the story.   The landscapes are often gorgeous, and the various details of high class, low class, city, country are all played nicely against each other. So the problem really comes down to the main actors. Molly and Andrew maybe have gotten too used to playing ensemble roles where each person just has to be a stereotype without a lot of depth. You really get a sense of shallowness when you're watching this movie. Andrew has an entire life including a long-term romance, that he's set in. In just 3 days he's thrown it all away for Molly - but you never get any real sense that he cares about her. Molly was supposedly taking some quite desperate steps to find safety in her life - including seducing and lying to Andrew in order to convince him to rescue her - but she never seems to care much either.   Intriguingly, only 2 people really seem to have depth in this movie. One is Ben Stiller, Andrew's best friend. It's ironic because Ben's character IS shallow and cares more for himself than for those around him. Even so, Ben really seems authentic as someone who isn't used to having to worry about others - but who really does try his best, many times, to get Andrew to wake up to reality. The other is Viggo Mortensen. You only glimpse Viggo once until the end of the movie - he's just referred to as a "rough guy" who has done many bad things. When you actually encounter Viggo (after Andrew has in essence broken into his house to confront him) you're prepared for the worst. However, Viggo is very patient, very well spoken, and quite intelligent in his commentary. He doesn't thrash Andrew for sleeping with his wife. Instead, he lays out the situation and makes both Andrew and Molly face their failings. Molly deliberately lied and used Andrew as a tool of getting a better life. Andrew, for his part, knew he'd never actually rescue Molly but led her on repeatedly to have time with her.   Some have said this is the worst movie ever. Many sections of it can be very painful to watch. However, I do find glimmers of meaning - especially in the ending discussion with Viggo. Even there, though, you would think this would be a moment of great soul searching for Andrew and Molly. Instead, both seem to think, "Yeah, I guess that's true. Oh well, see ya." I don't mind gloomy movies at all - in fact I really appreciate them sometimes. However, if a movie has no depth of character or quality acting, it just makes the whole experience fall flat. 
 Leadership depends upon dynamism (action). "Go forward." (p. 53) It means application using past battles as lessons. The author was clear that Patton believed in direct action based on facts. The center of the book stresses Patton's action orientation ad nauseum. The three maxums are speed, simplicity and boldness. In presentation, Patton has the sound of genius and the subtext tells a story of impulsive foolishness, high drama and overcompensation. It is unclear if the author intended to impliy that or if it is misreading in the Paul de Man sense. Pattion was a show and, perhaps, a rebel though that is not clear in the book either. He said "Army regulations are written by those who have never been in battle." (p 248) The author suggests it has something to say about corporate management. What, the author doesn't say. Using polite military terms, the book is S.O.S.(on toast) Go figure. Eric J. Lindblom PhD Harvar 
 I am not commenting on the work, just this audiobook version.   Poor production and dynamic range.  I have the abridged version of this audiobook and sometimes the narrator speaks so softly that I have to turn the volume up and then a moment later he speaks so loud it hurts my ears.  I have never had this happen with a Recorded Books audio book.  Inexcusable.    Also they put in some singing/opera clips.  Hey, I came to hear the book not some other stuff the producer decided to put in.   
 I originally became interested in Into Eternity when I saw them open for Stratovarius during the 2005 Monster Metal Madness North American Tour. Even though they weren't the reason I was there in the first place, I though they gave a pretty good performance and I decided to look into their music.  Unfortunately, after listening to this album, I'm reminded that first impressions are not always accurate. First of all, I about laughed myself to death at album description under editorial reviews that states this album is "a must for fans of Dream Theater, Iron Maiden... and Nevermore....". This band has absolutely nothing to do with these bands or the music they play (other than the fact Into Eternity probably wishes they were as good as these aforementioned bands that are light years beyond their skills), and is obviously slapped here as a selling point. Then again, I somewhat can't blame Century Media for writting such rubbish, considering Sonata Arctica and Nightwish have left the label for Nuclear Blast (leaving Firewind, Dream Evil and Royal Hunt as the label's sole acts I care about). Also, calling this is CD progressive is a joke as well.   The album's only redeeming feature is the main singer (no, not Mr. Death Growl #1 and #2). Unfortunately, the fact he is forced to take turns with the two death growl vocalists and we never get to hear his full range or abilities as they sing songs with lyrics that are so predictable to this kind of music you swear some depressed teenager wrote when he forgot to take his anti-depressants. I'm not saying you can write about death, disease, and everything and anything having to do with moral decay, but you have to make it interesting at least and add some intricate song structure! That said, the only songs on the album worth listening to are Buried In Oblivion and Black Sea of Agony, were the death vocalists take enough of back seat to the main vocalist and spare the listener of their sad attempt of sounding cool.  In all honesty, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone, because I can think of so many other bands and albums worthy of metal fans attention and hard earned dollars. Ok, so maybe I'm being a little harsh considering these guys are exactly "superstars" per say, but I think I've been pretty nice so far, as I didn't complain about the production quality or the drummer's stupid habit of banging on the same drum for 15 straight seconds and calling it music. Oh wait, I did complain, whoops... 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 While watching this film, I found myself irritated with the whining and bickering that goes on, and wondering how it could have been better.  HANGING UP tells the tale of three sisters: Meg Ryan is Eve, the bulwark of the family, runs her own business; Diane Keaton as Georgia has her own self titled magazine; and Lisa Kudrow is Matty, the somewhat vapid soap opera actress.  Their elderly father (Walter Matthau in his last movie role) is having memory problems, can't walk and is admitted to a hospital.  He is going to die.  Ryan is the daughter who is saddled with the responsibility of her father, while the other two are too self-centered to even care.  All of this could have made for a compelling "dramedy" but director Keaton allows over emoting and all that conflict to override the gentler side of losing a parent.  And Matthau is not all that likeable either.  Cloris Leachman has a brief appearance as his ex-wife and Adam Arkin is Ryan's globetrotting husband.  It's surprising that the most honest moment in the film comes in a brief sequence between Ryan and the mother of a doctor whose car she crashed into in the hospital parking garage.  Ryan tries gamely to hold the movie together and although she is quite good, she can't really salvage the film.  Keaton and Kudrow are both adequate, but no depth is observed.  Matthau is more like Matthau than a true character and it's sad that his last role is so unlikeable.  HANGING UP tries to tackle sensitive and real issues but it's so contrived it fails 
 For a concise guide, I was still anticipating something more than this. It is great for beginners, and it has a Pagan view to working with stones. Thus, it definitely adds more folklore to the mix. This bok discusses some of the famous 'cursed' stones, amuletic magick, and elixirs. Perhaps the best reason to add it to one's collection (if not the only one) is to use it for all of the tables of correspondences.  This is a good book to keep around for a quick reference guide or for constructing spells based upon stone magick. The tables are very useful, though there are other books with more comprehensive sections than this 
 You won't want to read this as a bedtime story to young children.  They're sure to have nightmares!  
 This book has everything to do with cheating your money out of your pocket in whatever way the "master" can manage. It has nothing to do with actual financial market investing/trading. Beware of "master" of DECEIT!!!!!!  Give it a minus 100 stars. 
 I bought this book the day it came out.  Dennis Lehane is one of my top 5 favorite authors.  What a letdown.  He is so talented I will buy his next book the day that it comes out, however this one does not showcase his talent.  
 Don't buy these batteries, because they don't last long like Energizer or Duracell. These Eveready batteries ain't never ready 
 This is yet another book in a long line of books from either the far right or the far left that do nothing but try to divide the country.  There is no issue that is black and white, there are more sides to issues than just the right or left.    This book may be for you if you are a mindless sheep who is to lazy to think for yourself.  And this is only my opinion.  Judge it for yourself.  
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 My husband had only been gone for a handful of days when I ordered this book.  I read all the reviews here and thought that the "religious" aspect would somehow be acceptable, perhaps very helpful.  I was stopped dead in my tracks when I read the following:  "At its very nature death is demonic, and you cannot explain the demonic.  Death happens.  It is not really God's fault, nor yours, nor that of your spouse.  Death is the devil's calling card."  Are you kidding me?  I lost my husband!  He died!  In the context of searching for spiritual understanding, the idea that the devil is responsible for my beloved husband's death is absurd.  Even if the practical, therapy half of this book might be helpful...it is made null and void in my mind by allowing such utterly nonsensical and antiquated thinking to prevail.  I quote further:  "Lazarus will come storming from the tomb.  Death can't hold him back with the power of Christ on his side.  Jesus is weeping because sin has broken this world, and death is a symbol of that brokenness.  Even though he has the power to fix it, Jesus grieves."  Am I to believe that my husband's death is punishment for "original sin"?  The message here is that we, "man", are the cause of the curse of death, through sin we have brought death upon ourselves and only at the second coming of the Messiah will we be "resurrected".    If these ideas bring comfort to those who grieve the loss of a spouse, then this is a good book to read.  I write this only as a warning to those who might have different "religious", spiritual or "Christian" beliefs, or those who may be seeking spiritual guidance.  The opinions set down in this book can be very discomforting and offensive.  
 Purchased Cobra 75 WX ST All-in-handset Mobile CB about 1 year ago. Easy installation, up-front controls, very convenient. Six months after installation speaker in mike failed, could only get sound through external speaker, using external jack. Repair shop said it would cost almost as much to fix as the unit cost.  
 I heard the author on a podcast and thought that what he had to say was interesting and relevant to identifying and changing self-defeating behaviors in a work environment. I think that the behaviors that he identifies in each chapter are relevant self-defeating behaviors and the writing is clear. However, I have been disappointed with this book for several reasons. Firstly, I think that the remedies proposed for each behavior are superficial prescriptions. For example, effetive delegation requires not just identifying a task to be delegated, but a multi-step process of identifying the task, explaining the task to the delegee, getting mutual agreement on what needs to be done, the time  to complete the task, the resources availalble to complete it, and the expected standards at completion. No such framework is laid out. This is true of all the chapters in the book. Secondly, this would not be so bad if the author pointed the reader at other books or resources to flesh out these ideas. However, the book has no index and no bibliography or suggested references. This is an unpardonable sin in publishing, to my mind. No references and no index bespeaks a book rushed to market. Either that, or it's a tactic to get the author to consult to companies to give the specific information on how to remedy the behaviors.   I hope some of these criticisms can be addressed if there is to be a second edition of the book. 
 This book touts itself as a valuable lesson on the horrors of war but there are many more appropriate ways of broaching this discussion with small children than to bombard them with a dreary, depressing and grotesque tale of animal cruelty and suffering. I don't recommend this book for children OR adults. There are many better books, such as "Johnny Tremain" or "The Diary of Anne Frank" that bring home the point of suffering without grisly, needlessly graphic descriptions of animal cruelty that are completely age-INappropriate. 
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 I'm all about buying pretty things, but this pretty thing pretty much don't work the way you'd want.  While the iPod Nano is in the case, neither outlets on the bottom are accessible-- more importantly, the headset jack.  
 This might work for families with older teenagers, but my kids (10 and 13) just won't eat things like baked fish or squash or eggplant. They're not picky kids; we travel extensively and they'll eat all kids of food, but I'd say four out of five of the recipes in this book were failures at my dinner table. It's a good place to start if you have no idea how to cook for a family, but I've had much more success with Cooking Light 
 This book completely fails to realistically convey the relative risks and profit potential for the average wannabe day trader.  Im talking about someone with less than a few thousand to play the market.  Unless you have big bucks and Level II quotes forget day trading unless you are very lucky. In the trading parlance, I wish I had a short position on this book at its current price, and could cover my short at the current used price! Save your money 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 the furniture itself is fine. or rather, it would be if it was shipped properly. before ordering anything from target, think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return. if you receive something damaged (and you will), be prepared for an extensive return process. chances are, the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well. this happened to me twice. if you're lucky, you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments. this, however, will take time. additionally, even if the piece is not cracked, you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood. i bought the desk, the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain.   also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier. after waiting and waiting, and calling target on several occasions, someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment - even though other pieces arrived without such complications.   quite honestly, this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth. by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax, this is not so much a "deal" but a waste of time and money. 
 After quite a few phone calls, I was finally told that there are many problems with the "Fax Receiving Function" for this product...  Yet there were no mentioning of this situation on HP's website. HP rated it 4 or more stars. Now their staff finally told me the truth!!!  I wish I had known it earlier 
 The "twist" is apparent from so far off that I actually hung on till the end, assuming that something more interesting would happen -- that surely there was more to it than I suspected. Alas, no. Much, much too simplistic and predictable, like a weak joke that goes on for hours -- which is a pity, because the author has real skill.   This is one of the books I literally threw at the wall after I finished, so great was my disappointment at having wasted my time. Mr. Phillips! Please write another book: one that respects the reader's intellect 
 My dad bought this book to assist his diet concerning his diabetes, but I am disappointed with it, namely because it does not have a SUGAR column on its Fast Food tables of Menus! I understand that carbs add up to becoming sugar and such, but why did they not list Sugar in a book for diabetics!  It puts a best bet check mark by different menu items, but I get the impression that these are merely the lesser evils on the fast food menus. Unfortunately, my dad sees the check marks and insists that these are healthy food items for him, for example, the Wendy's Jr. Frosty!   I think that most people can just go online to their most favorite fast food restaurant web sites and download the nutritional information there, which will include the sugar content! I did that with the Wendy's Jr. Frosty and found out it has 21g of Sugar! If my dad saw that on a Nutritional Label on a grocery store item, he would refuse to buy it! I wish I had been with him when he was shopping and bought this book, because I would have pointed out this major omission of Sugar information that is lacking in this book!  This book may have its uses when used properly, or for folks who don't care about their Sugar intake, but from my experience with my elderly father who desperately needs to eat RIGHT for his diabetes, this book is making it harder for me to get him to do so 
 The thrilling mystery story that we have come to expect from Anne Perry takes a new twist in this book. Perhaps inspired by true events in 1898 Vienna, where three persons died of plague, this is not so much a story of crime but of survival. Unfortunately other qualitites that we have also come to expect from this author, like sound research and verisimilitude, are absent here. There are glaring gaps in logic, occasional sloppy proofing, and, at least as I understand the nature of plague, serious factual mistakes. This is too bad, since the story could have been a fitting installment in the quest of the protagonists for social improvement in mid-19th century London. As it is, the book gave me the impression that perhaps Anne Perry has currently too many irons in the fire and no longer spends enough time on the kind of careful work that characterized her earlier novels 
 Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute.  Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all.  Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets.  I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time 
 ...for fifty cents, and I would say I probably got my money's worth.  Although the critic who said, "reads like a third-rate middle school book report" might be exaggerating a little, he wasn't exaggerating much.  Also, the book devotes an inordinate amount of time to obscure topics which have not proven to be worth their salt to have more than brief mention in many evolution texts: computer models, evolutionary psychology, and the Theory of Complexity.  There are far more interesting and important issues to discuss.  Morris does a good job of not taking any sides to any of the arguments he presents, as a consequence creating doldrums for over much of the book.  If you must choose between reading this book, taking the wife out shopping all day at the mall, or sawing off your hand with a miter saw, by all means read this book!  However, this is one of the worst pop-science books in this genre that I have read 
 Basically I thought this was a good deal because it included both the original and the remake.  But if that's all you want is one of those or both, just buy both.  The rest of this series was a waste of time.  Part II had so many predictable deaths, I felt like I was watching "Final Destination," which is a decent series unto itself, but with "The Omen" being about mankind's end of days according to scripture, I expected more of a supernatural feeling and events foretold in the Bible.  This series had no Armageddon, no Mark of the Beast, nothing apocalyptic but a creepy little boy who was the product of the stereotypical spoiled, silver-spoon white American family.    I say, watch the first one and leave it at that 
 This book is written by a Christian layman, and is full of references to God and Jesus throughout the book. In my opinion, working with oneself with regards to any issue, should never be based on any religion of any kind. It should be independent of any religious belief.  The book talks a lot about love as the key to build friendships, like Jesus did. "love and be loved again". His rules to achieve deeper relationships are:  1. Assign top priority to your relationships 2. Cultivate transparency (be open and honest) 3. Dare to talk about your affection 4. Learn the gesture of love 5. Create space in your relationships  The book has a naive and unprofessional approach to the topic. While the author is aware of the fact that too much emotion, care, interest, help, kindness and so on could challenge the relationship, he does not give it much attention, and he even says that too much is better than too little, which is not always true.  It does not provide a way to get closer to the people you care for. There is nothing in this book, which is not already common knowlegde. Everything in the book is basic. It could go as a sweet and funny Christian book about friendships in general. But it is not a professional book about how to go from a regular friendship to a deep and close friendship 
 The phone is great .. and I knew it would be.  And I am a devoted Amazon shopper.  My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans ... a concern that has proved well founded. I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this site indicating the Pearl "shipped hot," with an active SIM, which meant for those that -- like me - were upgrading (vs. new service), their existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route.  To be fair, that did NOT happen; however, I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept.  The instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the SIM, turn on the phone, and it will work.  And, if it doesn't work, it says, don't call Cingular, call Amazon.  I followed the instructions -- phone didn't work, I called Amazon, at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS!!!  Unfortunately, I let the poor guy have it ... I told him what I truly believe, which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone - which is supposed to work out of the box -- isn't working.  So - 5 Stars for the phone itself ... awesome!  2 stars for Amazon ... they do NOT have the kinks worked out yet.  On a positive note -- I immediately called Cingular, and they resolved the problem for me on the spot (SIM was not activated / in the system) 
 Not often one can find a book so irrelevant as this.  It repeats the same trivia in support of irrelevant points and never gets to make a contribution to creativity.  It is amazingly ignorant on scientific, technical and art issues and oddly enough it tells lies about those whom supposedly has interviewed.  Where do I get my money back ? 
 Let me just start off by saying I am a rabid fan of all genres of zombie films, but the 80's Italian genre is particularly unique to me.    I read the bad reviews, but expected to enjoy the film anyway (this is coming from someone who loved Hell of the living dead, Zombie 3, and City of the living dead, 3 technically awful films)  Sadly Zombie Lake is completely devoid of any entertainment value or redemption of any sort.  This is more like a porn movie with zombies thrown in than a flat out zombie movie.  That does indeed sound entertaining but the charm wear's off real quick.  The gore- lame.  When a zombie takes a bite of someone, you don't see tearing flesh, you only (occasionally at that) see blood.  The acting- as usual, it is awful (complete with dubbed american voices) but can, like most Italian zombie films, be overlooked.  Picture- it's nice.  Good photography but it doesn't pull this one out of the garbage.  Plot- I've wondered often where it is, but then I realized there isn't one.  Overall, this is horrible, and I wouldn't even recommend it to fans of truly bad zombie movies.  However, it is certainly a step above such trash picks as Todd Sheets' "Zombie Bloodbath" and "Zombie Rampage" and pretty much all other shot-on-video zombie movies...but just barel 
 Sorry to have to pan it, but as far as I got in the book, it was self-important and self-indulgent 
 The quality of the DVD's was good. However I did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons. It seemed that the story was setting up for season 4. 
 I swear if it wasn't that i liked final fantasy 7 and 8 so much i'd just break this game at then i'd move on and be happy. But i can't do that because that would be waste of money the only thing that kept me in the game was the fact that i did'nt want to waste money. This game makes kingdom hearts look like a M rated game. Oh my god this is so childish. You know how in most final fantasy games they try to make the main character cool they didn't feel like doing that in this one. You are a monkey-man! How stupid is that. Plus the other character are way more dumb looking that the main one im just happy i beat in and can put that awful exp. behind me. AHHHHHHHHHH 
 In his magnum opus, 1984, George Orwell famously wrote,  "Who controls the past, controls the future and who controls the present controls the past". This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well.  In his latest book "Collapse" Jared Diamond" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination.  Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,   "It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair"  It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure.  Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, "The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food.  In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.   The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?  
 At the same time I also ordered Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child which turned out to be much more informative and useful.  I was exhausted with my 3 month old waking up 5-6 times a night for the pacifier to be replaced in his mouth.  I would nurse him 1-2 times when he wouldn't go right back to sleep.  I couldn't bear to hear him cry and would always attend to him immediately.  Elizabeth Pantley's suggestions were really not anything different than I had been doing.  I tried not picking him up and he was fine as long as someone put the pacifier back in his mouth.  For my son's sleep problems her method really isn't feasible when you are so exhausted.  I strongly recommend Dr. Richard ferber's book " Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems".  This book made the most sense and informs you about infant sleep patterns.  Our very simple solution was to take away his pacifier.  It was hard for me to do but he was 4 months old at this point and I was desperate.  Turns out it was not anywhere near as hard as I thought it was going to be on him.  He cried for about an hour before falling asleep and I would comfort him in his crib every ten minutes.  It took him about 2 days to learn how to fall asleep alone without it and he has been much happier since.  He no longer has fragmented sleep and is much happier when he wakes up.  His book also explains how to wean them off of wanting to be rocked to sleep in your arms or nursed to sleep.  It involves some crying but not ignoring them.  As a first time mom I did not like the idea of ever letting my baby cry but after reading these books and my experience has proved that a little crying is ok and NOT harmful.  It is actually not in the best interest of your child after 3 months to always pick them up so that they never learn how to fall asleep on their own.  My son went from waking up 5 times a night to sleeping throught the night 8-12 hours over the past 8 weeks.  He is now 6 months old and sleeps really well. My experience FWIW 
 This book is geared for people that are brand new to Quicken entirely, not just Quicken 2007.  If you have EVER used Quicken at any point in your entire life, you will find this book too elementary.  I was hoping to learn some hints and tricks that I didn't already know, and perhaps how to take advantage of the improvements that Quicken 2007 offers over Quicken 2005.  I didn't find that in this book.  I was particularly disappointed in the way the author almost totally ignores the online capabilities of Quicken and its ability to help you track investments.  He basically says you shouldn't be worrying about these things, so he's not going to talk about it.  But if you need help with such things as backing up a file and balancing your checkbook, you may find the book helpful 
 What movie was every one else watching?  Certainly not this one.  Very, very, slow.  Disjointed story line.  I hate to be a bore but this was boring.  Enjoy 
 That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.  Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever 
 All Old strategies that Will lose you money on eBay today. Pushes you to use a service like "marketworks" which is OK for big sellers, but garbage for the rest of us. The Only thing that matters on ebay is price. forget everything else, get it as cheep as you can, and sell it for less then anyone else. Keep your money for the listing fees. Don't bother with this old book 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 I thought Tim A. Berra's "A Natural History of Australia" was a half baked research paper by a C student.  It made me doubt that the author was really an expert on the natural history of Australia or just compiling  a list of miscellaneous facts from numerous sources and presenting them in  organized text form.  There are several inexcusable holes in this list of  facts as well.  Understandably, anyone writing a book with a title like  this would be confounded by the huge subject of evolution in this isolated  continent.  But instead of attempting an expository essay on this he,  more-or-less, lists several key dates on evolution's time-line (many of  these are on a planetary scale not specific to Oz) and leaves it at that.   The two page chapter on geography explains next to nothing, historically  speaking. It tells you that Australia is the flattest, driest, most stable  continent etc etc, but never digs into the geologic past to say WHY.  By  avoiding the stories, and explanations behind WHY Australia became such a  unique place the book misses its own supposed HISTORICAL point.  That  frustrated me.  I would recommend this book only as a natural almanac full  of thousands of facts and photos, but never as a natural history 
 Boring, boring, and oh, did I mention boring?  It was short, not terribly clever at all, and the illustrations are not even Dr. Suess. I felt ripped off.  I don't know why I thought it was tooth "fairy" related, as our daughter just lost her first tooth and we thought this would tie in.  It doesn't.  Neither of my kids (3 and 6)liked this even a little.  They both said it was...boring.  
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Concise Ed., edited by Paul Burns, ISBN 0-8146-2903-2, Copyright 2003  Consider another book.  Despite "Butler's" being in the title, it seems to bear no relation to the Butler's Lives of the Saints published in the 1950s and 1800s.   Defects: 1. There is no index or alphabetical list of saints.  If you want to look up a saint by name, you have to scan the list of 366 saints in the table of contents, which is six pages long.  An index would have provided quick access.  2. Saints are not listed under their actual commemoration day. Why?  Because the saints did not "die on conveniently spaced dates" (page xi).  Nothing in the description of the saint alerts you to the date being wrong.  To determine the correct day, you have to closely read a paragraph at the beginning of the month.   3. The book does not bear an imprimatur from a bishop or "nihil obstat" showing that it's free from error.  To illustrate why this is a problem, one-third of the entry for St. Maria Goretti is not about her; it's a critique of her sainthood and of the Church.  Example: in "feminist circles ... Maria has been seen more as a martyr to patriarchal society" (p. 310) 
 I having nothing but praise for Ari Fleishcher's work as President Bush's press secretary.  But unfortunately, his decision to treat his book like just another press conference makes for a very disappointing, unsatisfying read.  What struck me the most was his failure to offer anything even remotely critical of the President.  His hero worship/adherance to the party line as press secretary makes perfect sense, but as an independent minded author, one is forced to question how in his years with the President, he failed to see a single thing that had been handled incorrectly.  Is this the immaculate Presidency?  Could anyone be that perfect?  As a supporter of President Bush, I was hoping to discern a more complete picture of his leadership skills and character.  But all you get here is a campaign ad.  He even spins the now infamous "Mission Accomplished" banner, using it as an opportunity to slam the press for failing to report the full breadth of the President's remarks.  I supported the war, but c'mon Ari, this was a screw up of monumental proportions in terms of public perception.  An honest statement like "we were right on the substance, but we made a big mistake in terms of giving our detractors ammunition" would have been welcome and refreshing.  Instead, like with most campaign commercials, after a while, you just stop listening and want to change the channel.   
 This is far from a 4 or 5 start outing.  However there is the stand out track "I finally know".  I play this one several times in a row when it comes ont my mp3 player.  Too bad the rest of the CD wasn't this good.  
 We went through the process of cleaning the tank and sterilizing the water, adding the package of sea monkeys, and finally feeding the sea monkeys and NOTHING happened. (...). Hope these are not dead 
 I have read all of Paretsky's books with Warshawski as the heroine (ha!) and used to look forward to the next.  With the last few, I have just plodded through and skipped pages trying to find the "good stuff" that would keep me interested without predictability.  Sadly, "Fire Sale" never grabbed my attention.  I kept going back to it while reading other books, hoping to find something of the Warshawski that I used to like, but all of it just seemed redundant.  Recycled characters, plot, etc... but not in a good way.  Perhaps it's time for Paretsky to invent a new line of novels so we can enjoy her again 
 A child wants to tell his father he loves him, and the father turns the exchange into a cruel game of one-upmanship.  The child tries and tries until he collapses, exhausted - and still the father won't accept the heartfelt message and chooses to outdo his tiny child and have the last word. That this book is popular and well received is disturbing to me.  The illustrations are very nice - and I'm hoping that this is the attraction people feel, since the message borders on psychological abuse 
 Unless you are thrilled by crude language don't bother,as this book really doesn't offer anything else. i read it as i am a penn + Teller fan but it was very disappointing 
 This book is totally dissapointing. The authors have no knowledge of aviation business. All the book is just ass-leaking of SWA. They should have done more research just to understand how airline business work.  The book repeats and repeats the same. It is just honoring of SWA. SWA has no flaws, SWA is the best etc. And there is no explanation why it is best. It is just abstract explnations from textbooks on Leadearship etc. There is no logyc connection between the statements they make and the results they come to in this book.  If you have too much money and time to waste, and you are a masohistic type of person who likes to be dissapointed by some stupid mediocre unprofessional writing by people who do not know anything the thing they write about - this book for you. Otherwise - just forget about the book called "Nuts!" by Freibergs and look for another good source of information about SWA 
 These were purchased for my Grandson for Christmas. They are hard to get on. Clumsy and don't have the effect they would have you believe. He never really used them and  a waste of money. They were useless and also very dangerous.  Defintely would not recommend. 
 I have been reading Jodi Picoult's books since I first came across The Pact at the library.  And from there I glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as Songs of the Humpback Whale and then her books, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, Perfect Match and Plain Truth.  Unfortunately in recent years I haven't been able to get into some of her titles, specifically Vanishing Acts and My Sister's Keeper.  The latter title was just too sad for me to finish.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I picked up the CD of The Tenth Circle while at the library. Because I was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form, I was concerned that I might be missing something although other readers said I wouldn't be missing much.  But at this point I must add that while the reader did a fine job and I was initially intrigued with the plot and characters, this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me.  I won't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this, rather offer, instead my  views just as I finished this title.  I just finished listening to The Tenth Circle and found it was such a grim book.  Not that Jodi Picoult's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said, "There ought to be a moratorium on grief."  Unbelievable the imagination some writers have.  Maybe that's why they're writers and I'm not.  But there were some unanswered questions, coincidence, sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly.  And I might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book I enjoyed.  But I do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but I just found it overall very disappointing. I do hope I'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but I used to love this author's books and wonder if I'll continue to read her which makes me sad. 
 Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 I enjoyed this author's other "Outsmarting" book better, the one NOT about menopause.  This book comes across as whiney at times with a "woe-is-me" approach to midlife, despite her efforts to appear positive.  She condones eating things like French fries, potato chips, full-fat products, daily chocolate and has a minimum-necessary approach to fitness.  She clearly isn't a fitness fanatic.  She even mentions that larger women can have a commanding presence and lists Aretha Franklin as an example!  Hello, that woman epitomizes over-indulgence.  Also, if you are very active, you will have to get more food into you than she says.  I tried to only eat the smallest meals only when I was hungry, and probably because I am fit and exercise regularly, I needed quite a few more calories than she suggested.  I suggest women look to a life full of activity as an antidote to depression and aging, and I would not suggest, as the author does, that the fat we need in our diet come from junk foods like potato chips.  There are so many more ways to get fat into your diet that don't involve saturated fats.  Avoiding bad foods does not qualify as a "diet."  It's good sense 
 I would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb.  Quite frankly I would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just Reburning these CD's and reselling them.  For 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorite 
 They sounded good, but aren't tart enough for my taste and are prepared with too much sugar 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 Daniel Pipes said about this book:  "With uncommon skill, Shlaim has managed-in the confines of a very small volume with very large margins-to pack misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense into 1994's worst book on the Middle East."  Well, is that true?  Probably.  But just to show everyone that I am not only tolerant and soft-hearted, but generous, I'll give this book not just one, but two stars!    You see, there are plenty of facts in this small book.  In addition to the misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense which it does indeed abound with.  Shlaim claims that the 1973 Yom Kippur War broke the diplomatic stalemate in the region and led to peace.  He's not the only one to have said this.  But I wouldn't consider saying something like this on a dare.  I'd be laughed out of town!   Could I say with a straight face that the way to start negotiations towards peace is to launch a war of aggression against a neighbor?  No.  And just how strong is the peace between Egypt and Israel anyway?  Not very.  It is more a cease-fire than a peace, with a constant barrage of anti-Israeli propaganda from the Egyptian side.  After that, we see Shlaim explain that land-poor Israel can have territory or peace.  Really?  I think it is more reasonable for those who want peace to permit land-poor nations to buy or keep something closer to their fair share of land.  In my opinion, Israel is more likely to have both territory and peace or neither of them than one or the other.  And the author says that Israel can have territory or American support.  Again, this could well be a false choice.  Even if Israel, for some reason, can not have both American support and territory, why ought one expect it to have American support if it does not have territory?  Shlaim sums up the problem of the Arabs versus the Jews.  Security pleases the Jews.  Fairness pleases the Arabs.  I wish this were true.  Let's see.  Fairness.  Does that mean letting everyone, including Jews and Arabs, buy land throughout the region and keep it?  Does that mean a Truth and Reconciliation session or two where the Arabs can apologize for their violence and aggression against Levantine Jews?  Sounds fair to me!  Shlaim is totally out of line to pretend that it is unfair to not steal Jewish land, or that it is unfair to allow Israel to stay on the map.  As for the Oslo peace accords, Shlaim praises them as the beginning of a new era.  Plenty of people were extremely suspicious of Oslo.  Shlaim was wrong here.  And those who were suspicious of Oslo generally had the right reasons to be suspicious.  I think that ought to make us more than a little suspicious of Shlaim.  Now, what does Shlaim recommend?  It is simple.  America is simply too much in favor of Israel!  Shlaim thinks we need a more "even-handed" approach.  And that (this was written before 9/11) America ought not "bolster Israel as a strategic partner in an unwinnable war against an imaginary Islamic threat."  Wow.  Imaginary.  But unbeatable.  Shlaim really took a strong view here.  I think 9/11 showed that we're dealing with a real, not an imaginary threat.  And in the long run, why shouldn't a war in favor of truth, justice, and human rights be winnable?  I see no reason to give up without even trying.  If you want to learn about war and peace in the Middle East, try some other book 
 I have heard this CD (25 Romantic Classics). The main problem in the 25 tracks is that most of them are not pure romantic music. The Air on G string could not be classified as "Romantic" because the general theme is closer  to  tragic than romantic. The same thing goes for Vivaldi's allegro. The  Performance of Mozart's Piano concerto in A made by the poor "Israel Chamber Orchestra"  is weak, and i am still wondering of putting this performance in the CD Although  There are  dozens of great performances for Mozrat's piano concertos. The performance of Beethoven's Fur Elise is quite poor. it went faster than the usual, in addition to extreme use of the sustaining pedal. I Believe that any amateur could perform it better than the soloist here. I wonder why t Chopin's prelude no.7 is in such a CD, its quite out of any conceivable thematic context in addition to being to short. preludes such  No.6 (the Tolling Bells) and No.15 (Raindrops) could have been much better for such a CD of romantic music. Add to that, the  pianist didn't use the tempo rubato in playing this piece. So the semi-romantic piece was totally destroyed. The rest of the tracks too humble for the serious critic. I don't believe that this CD makes any addition to any classical collection 
 I purchased this coffeemaker for my boyfriend. When I opened the box you could tell that the item had already been removed. When I took the coffeemaker out, to my surprise, there were still grounds in the filter area. Needless to say I was disappointed that I received a "used" coffeemaker. I promptly returned the coffeemaker and purchased another at a local store 
     DVD had sticky substance around center of disc which was unnoticed when loading into machine. It required taking machine apart to remove 
 This book was overwhelming and disorganized - what I mean was that there lacked a unifying theme; a little legalistic.  The indicative should come before the imperative.  
 I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of "Sister" 
 Brandon Sanderson's debut deserves great praise for offering the rarest of fantasies:  a stand-alone novel.  Furthermore, he eschews the classic tropes of fantastical races in favor of a modern-fantasy type medieval world fragmented by religious politics and a mysterious biological plague.  Unfortunately, little else in _Elantris_ is as original or promising as the concept.  The pace is numbingly slow, especially in the early chapters of Sarene discovering her way through Arelon.  Huge passages of expository dialog between her and her Tinker Bell-like floating confidant serve only to dump background information on the reader.  Clunky prose repeatedly distracts from the tale.  Sanderson's fantasy names are too similar to avoid confusion, often starting with the same series of letters:  Derethi religion and Dathreki Mountains, arteth priest and Arelon kingdom, Fjon the priest and Fjordell the religion.    Worse still, the characters are shallow modern archetypes--the tables-turned prince and his world-wise new friend, the harsh militant priest, and the perky young princess who changes the world.  They react most predictably to the situations they face, and many of those situations seem gratuitously engineered by the author to force the outcome he wishes.  The dialog is laughably wooden, lines that real people would never say.  "'Something just doesn't feel right here,'" Sarene tells Ashe at one point, and she's exactly right.  Sanderson's concept is wise and full of potential, but his writing is not yet equal to that challenge 
 It is obvious Gary Leon Hill is a writer of fiction. Dramatic writing for the stage does not transfer well to the page. I was not so much 'Shocked and Intrigued'as 'Shocked and Disgusted'at his portrayal of victims of suicide as having done so because a 'spirit' has taken them over and made them do it. According to G.L.H. drug/drink addicts are 'asking for it' and Psychiatric hospitals are full of the possessed. Is this Victorian attidudes or Creative writing? The latter, I think. Stick to writing plays, Mr. Hill, and don't insult my intelligence or the memory of many a poor soul who took their life due to whatever unfortunate circumstances they found themselves in 
 This novel was a terrible disappointment for me because I have enjoyed almost all of Elizabeth Berg's previous novels.  This one, however, is so unrealistic, so phony and so easy to see where the story is leading.  An idyllic marriage, a perfect little town, ideal new neighbors and acquaintances,  friends who rush to the aid of the new widow even though she has ignored them for 30 years, and so on.  Too treacly by far! 
 Good book but it's outdated. This book uses a method that nobody uses anymore. Google for "the PF tek" to learn the easiest way to grow mushrooms with good yield and for cheap using readily available materials like brown rice, distilled water and jars, without the need for a pressure cooker.   There are better methods like spawning to horse manure, casing with Miracle Grow Moisture Control and so forth. You can find more info on The Shroomery (google it) forums. 
 You can do better for the money. The image quality is below average and low light is really bad, even for a novice camcorder. I'm glad to see the price has come down. The camcorder did not come with the software needed to capture video or even play the dvd on my computer(it really should have). I would do more research and choose a camera that is right for you. I found many online camcorder review sites very helpful. I returned it and bought another panasonic with 3ccd technology. It has much better picture quality. If you want really good night vision go with sony. I would not recomend this camcorder to anyone 
 I almost got into an argument with a cashier when purchasing this album.  He mentioned it was the best thing he'd ever heard by Anita in years.  I had to disagree based on airplay so far but was giving the album a chance.  I had already noticed that the phrasing, improvisation and clearly - the voice we know - was not there. I gave the album a chance, hoping for more, but it didn't happen.  This CD has been on my living room table for quite a long time now.  I've listened to it in it's entirety about three times just knowing it will hit me at some point but it doesn't.  Yes, I've been a fan of Anita's too.  I was ecstatic the day The Songstress was re-issued on CD many years ago.  I have the Chapter 8 album on the original vinyl release.  I'm from Detroit too and have every reason to plug Anita.  Anyway, very disappointing.  Of about 650 CD's and 600 more vinyl LP's, I was sifting through them all about a week ago and hate to say it but I picked about 20 to sell and Anita's latest will be one of them going to the cut-out bin.  The "work" was obviously not put in to this album.  I was just listening to "My Everything" on the radio prompting me to write this.  The vocals almost seem amateuristic and a forced attempt to rekindle past masterpieces.    Times are hard around here although I've heard better things about other parts of the country but paying $16-$20 for something you have confidence that you'll get your $$$ worth and you don't is rather tiring.     I think Amazon's offer to purchase her latest effort for a penny when opening a credit card sums it all up.  Sorry Anita but do give me credit for introducing your work to a whole new audience when inviting co-workers and friends to your concert at Pine Knob way back in the 80's.  
 I realize that I'm supposed to think "Empire" is brilliant, because it's Gore Vidal, but it is a major bore.  Nothing actually happens; its just 400+ pages of dialogue.  A well-written conventional history of the period would be more enjoyable and more informative.  This is a total snooze-fest 
 A learning resource manual is not the same as the real book! It's just for teachers, so they know questions what questions to ask on a test 
 A beautiful young woman suspects that her astronaut husband might have been radically altered by an in flight astronaut. His partner has a suicidal freak-out, and so does his partner's wife. She learns that she is pregnant and so the stakes increase. Ultimately, a desperate ex-CIA man struggles to spill the beans to her. Will he make it? Will she?   There is suspense in this suspense/sci-fi film; unfortunately, it is unintentional. It consists in wondering when the film is going to get suspenseful. We know everything from the get-go. We know what the husband's secret is, and we know the wife will eventually find out. The only possible pay-off is that the director makes what happens, when Theron's character finally figures it out, interesting. Unfortunately, she only finds out for sure about an hour and a half into a film well shy of two hours. How interesting could the remainder be? You do the math.  I absolutely adore watching Charlize Theron, both for her obvious charisma, as well as her genuine dramatic ability. How she got sucked into this piece of dreck might serve as a lesson for her. It is certainly a mystery to me why a woman who could snag roles in "Celebrity" and "Cider House Rules" would select this script. Perhaps she felt she could save it, since the entire focus is on her character. She did not. The script and the direction made it simply impossible. Even a true Theron fan, like myself, will be sorely let down ( even more so for Depp fans, of which I am not one. 
 I bought this DVD player to play DVD's from Australia.  It worked great for about 10 months with very light use.  However, it started freezing up and not reading discs.  After doing research, I learned that the laser lights on these machines are very weak and don't last long.  It's cheaper to buy a new one than to get it fixed.  Hold out for a better product 
 I bought this book to get ideas to paint my ceilings.  Basically it was pretty much the same thing over and over again, with slight variations.  Not at all what I was looking for 
 This book you might browse through amazon=s Search Inside system. You will see it is nothing but a collection of irrelevant "how many angels dance on the head of a pin?" questions, formative not normative.  To discover the essence and truth of what Catholics really believe, study instead the Reverend Father Richrd McBrien: Catholicism. Study the National Conference of Bishop-s The Challenge of Peace: GOd-s Promise and Our Response. Study the good Pope John-s Pacem in Terris. Study Gaudium et Spes, and you will discover that NO Catholic can participate in any way indirectly nor directly in our sixteen year long war against Iraq, which has left over a million dead. Study our US Conference of Catholic Bishop=s Economic Justice For All, and realize the horror of our current administration=s domestic and foreign policies. Read Father Fox=s Creation SPirituality and relaize the accounting we will have to give of our stewardship of creation.  Instead of these meaningless considerations in this present book, read Archbishop Romero, Father Ellacuria, and consider carefully their martyrdoms for the poor of our Church and for their Gospel witness. Read the Reverend Father John Dear, SJ, and his companion, the courageous and thoughtful and Reverend Father Daniel Berrigan. Read Thomas Merton, especially his Peace in a Post=Christian Era, and contemplate that which a true Catholic Really Believes. Further study carefully Bishop Pedro Casaldaliga, the Rev. Father Charles Curran, Fr. Leonardo Boff=s writings especially his recent commentaries on the Our Father and the Hail Mary, and his earlier contemplation of the Stations of the Cross. Read the Magnificat, the prayer of Mary as to fate of the wealthy and of the poor.  Therein you may discover that which a Catholic Really Believes. Not here in Keating. All of these references are still available within the mighty amazon. 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 Well at least, some stuff is cool, free cam bag, the pics come out excellent. The video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard. Also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam. The adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining. The sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to "freeze up".  Bottom line...I recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams...but this one...isnt worth 159 or whatever. Its trash. Go for something else 
  I was forced to read Abel's Island for a school assingment. It was about this mouse on and island. Very boring.... It was miserable to have to read this, so do not waste your time reading it! 
 My objection was the implication that the "stars" played a part in the film.  I felt that the picture was completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15 minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less) and were clearly there to fool the viewer.  It was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary 
 I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since "Woman of Substance" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
 I saw the "Young" part.  I even saw the "Black" part.  But "Gifted"?  My God!  This was such a waste of time in my busy life.  I can't believe I was subjected to read such boring nonsense.  If you're thinking of reading this book, DO NOT.  You would have more fun  being dead 
 This set of books is always recommended and revered, but I always thought the language and Junie's actions and tantrums were atrocious.  I too found myself trying to substitute words for more parts of the book than we could read.  I kept thinking, maybe my daughter is not old enough.  Well, I am now thinking she will never be old enough, I mean I am shocked by these books.  I agree that it is essential for children to develop a love of reading, but let's do it with Jack and Annie (The Magic Tree House), or Cam Jansen, or something where the children do not act like the deliquents we all hope our children do not bring home as their new best friend!! 
 I used this as a text for an undergraduate course in aesthetics.  I would never use it again.  Beardsley seems to not understand that one need not include EVERY detail regarding EVERY person who ever made a comment on some  issue of aesthetics.  The result is a confusing and cluttered read that  drowns one in a myraid of loosely related facts.  A bigger problem is: I'm  not sure that anyone else tries to do what Beardsley does - present a  survey, with analysis, of the history of western aesthetics 
 When used as a self-study text, I found the book to be lacking a sufficient quantity of example problems solved in adequate detail to be truly helpful 
 The essence of the book is "corporations behave badly".  I happen to agree but I don't need 339 pages to tell me this.  I was hoping to learn something here.  I was hoping for some history of how corporations developed.  Nothing of the kind.  Just a comparison to the gilded age (late 1800s) repeated throughout the book that is obvious to anyone who knows American history.  Those liberals who love to read long winded tirades that support their point of view may enjoy this book.  But if you aren't a liberal or if you are a liberal with a brain, this book will bore you to tears 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 Mr. Greenblatt's theories continue an academic tradition of discounting the individual work of the writer by forcing historical context over text, treating the writer of a creative work as mere vessel.  What happened to the individual reader encoutering the writer via the work of art?  Of course, this common sense approach would cut short a lot of pedantic careers, and that is what Critical Theory is all about: it allows pedants to have a job 
 Flayderman is the bible of antique gun collecting.  Very informative historically with good bibliography for specific manufacturers.  Only issue is copyright is 2001 and values have changed a lot in the interim 
 Would that the producers would have spent their time and energy on season SIX, SEVEN, and EIGHT of this truly great Britcom series than to waste their time producing this overview of past glories.  AS TIME GOES BY is by my way of thinking the BEST of all the Britcoms that have come across the pond.  GIVE US THE REMAINING SEASONS rather that this "Best of . . ." abbreviation.  It may be a good introduction for those who have not seen the series on TV but your money is better spent on buying one of the seasons already available on DVD or catching whatever you local PBS station may be using as a filler in its broadcasting schedule.  Go for the full blown series, you won't be disappointed 
 I've seen a number of books that make all sorts of preposterous claims in order to promote some arbitrary agenda. However, this silly and absurd book doesn't even do that.  It has nothing to offer anyone.  I didn't have any preconceived demands on this book.  I didn't need it to say something like:  ... We Women hold up our half of the sky.  And more.  But in monotheistic society, we've been doing two thirds of the work.  And having only one third of the fun.  Moreover, this unnatural, patriarchal monotheism has made tyrannical religious demands upon us.  That's not how we lived in the past.  We can and should return to Paganism and a more natural and cooperative society which cherishes and values everyone. ...  Of course, had it said that and defended it with a modicum of clarity, I'd have applauded it and given it five stars.  But suppose it had merely looked at the overall problem of the role of Women in human society.  Something like:  ... There are differences between the roles of Women and Men.  The Women bear the children.  The Women nurse the children.  While both Women and Men have a big role in raising children, these roles are not exactly the same.  In addition, the Men are generally stronger than the Women.  One major societal problem is that Women tend to work harder to help their own children than they do to help the children of others.  And Men tend to work harder to help their children than they do to help the children of others.  But Women generally know which children are theirs while Men aren't always so sure.  Here's how some societies have dealt with these issues, and how a few societies, including our own, have gone astray.  And here is how we can make things better.  ...  Well, that would have been okay too.  And it would have been heading for five stars as well.  But this book didn't do anything of the sort.  Instead, it simply wandered all over the map.  There were plenty of factually dubious statements and poor logic that obliterated any possible flow of argument.  And there never seemed to be a point to it: almost nothing in the book seemed relevant to any possible thesis.  It was frustrating.  I doubt that I have ever read a less coherent book.  If you must read "The Chalice and the Blade," try the one by Glenna McReynolds 
 And I don't mean Al.  I was not all that aware of this sub-genre of the cop novel.  If lovingly described tableaux of decomposing bodies on the autopsy table or in the field is your favorite dish, then you've found your author.  Tess gets right in there with the stench of corpse gasses and the dribbling, squirting liquified putrefaction.  You may need a barf bag near to hand when you read this one.  What is the deal, people?  
 Main Line, Main Line.... those Main Liners.... You like to look at those Main Liners, don't you Ginger... I mean Kitty?  You the suffragette who just got offa the suffragette wagon...  the same wagon that was seen rolling by in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle... wait a minute... that was the exact same footage!  I guess the makers of this fine movie assembled it out of stock footage.  In fact Wynn, the MAIN LINER seems to be assembled out of stock footage of Bill Clinton.  Did you know allabout the MAIIINNNE LIIIIINNNEEE????  Seems the whole worl knows about the MAIIIIIIINNNNEEE LIIIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEE "Philadelphia Aristocracy"  See, in Philadelphia, they're old skool, dig.  They even got a Queen of Pennsylvania, who sits on a throne and stuff.  Played by Margaret Dumont when she's not getting scandalized by Groucho Marx.  And I believe there is a duke and duchess of Bakersfield.  And just the other day I had tea and crumpets with the Viscount of Compton.  Of the Night Train...  I mean Wild I... I mean Yeah, he was drinking Ripple back when Redd Foxx was merely the Duke of Cornwall.  He was in line to the throne... or was that waiting for the mens room... See, over here in the States we take our aristocracy just as seriously as our Prussian counterparts.  We are always to be seen marching around with those spiky helmets on, saluting the statue of Kaiser Bill's moustache 
 As a climatologist, i was quite intrested to read this book. After finising it, i was quite dissapointed. The author misrepresents science in every page. HE takes a complicated issue, and confuses the lay-man with his jargon. IT is a pity such intellectually dishonest books are allowed to be written 
 Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, "Reptile," makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with "Backless," "Another Ticket," and "Money & Cigarrettes" all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans 
 As a Brit and an avid "Vicar" fan, I was very disappointed in the 10th anniversary special.  Generally, it has lost its clever innocence and wackiness and Alice is far too self aware as an actor.  She's also lost her naive sweetness.  It just wasn't funny and bears none of its original surprise and appeal.  Having said that, I watch the series over and over again--it's brilliant!  
 This book is written as if it is a parody of a new age self-help book. I simply can't believe that any intelligent person would take it seriously. I heard of the poem and it is sort of nice in a new agey way. The book, which I looked at in a bookstore, is just laughable. Come on, people 
 I wonder if Jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel. One cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a Tom Clancy or John D. Macdonald style just because that's what film-going audiences like. I do not think this is a bad thing, but I, like some of the reviewers here, are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i.e., Macdonald's "Cape Fear," or use that tired Native American romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof. As for her writing style, she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. What we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the Walker parents, Davy, his fiancee, and to some extent, Lani, who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding Medicine Woman. Her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. The men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke. I kept seeing Jance speaking for them. So we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for Hollywood to call and possibly star Penelope Cruz as Lani Walker. What's the Tohono O'otham word for "2 thumbs down?&quot 
 The Good: The book contains an abundance of illustrations which can be very helpful.  The author uses the text of the book itself as bad examples of design.  The Bad: As a newbie to publication design, I approached this book as a student.  I probably would have never even opened the cover of it if it weren't required for a class.  The design of the cover (and most of the book) is horrible.  I can't read the title and it does nothing to attract me visually.  The illustrations are so sloppy they are unprofessional.  Although sketches in real life should be messy, the sketches in the book should at least be interpretable.  The author never uses any concrete terminology, so it is difficult categorize information as you absorb it. 
 How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding 
 I ordered this book based on Mr. Sullivan's review in part.  I thought it was my favorite silly book from childhood, the one that has "I am silly, you are silly, all of us are silly, Willy, all of us but cousin  Tilly...." etc.  But NO!  This book is a Picture Book with Silly  pictures.  I might call it "a silly book" but I wouldn't call it  "THE silly book."  For young kids 
 I really tried to enjoy this book but just couldn't manage to like it by the last page. This story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self, all through the magical Lazelle family. I found it to be simple minded and rambling. I'm not even sure the author was 100% where she was going in this book.   The main character, Gypsum, receives her powers later in life than her family. She was previously cast as the "normal" one, alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic. Her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times. Not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society. Most of the story runs like this: "I almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds. I need a cup of coffee" The author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over.   Everything is so strained and just plain wierd that I couldn't get into it. There is no personality in any of the characters. If it weren't for the adult situations and language I would have pegged this as a young adult novel. I think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored.   I gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties. Blah.  
 The design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.  I had assumed that I could leave the batteries in so that when I was at home I could use the adapter, but traveling I would use the batteries.  Don't make this mistake 
 Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through.  Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.'  This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread.  I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger.  I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction.  And the afterword by the author seemed smug.  I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never 
 This was an excellent book except for one glaring exception and that is the author sprinkled verses of scripture throughout the book.  I found her bible thumbing quite jarring and inappropriate and I plan to return the book despite its rich content.  Perhaps Mrs. Smith should have warned her readers by properly titling the book something like "When Your Christian Hormones Go Haywire" or "Solutions for Christian Women over 40" 
 Bill Bryson's zest for life is made manifest in the books he's written on pretty much whatever catches his interest.  This admirable quality has resulted in quite a lot of enjoyable reading, as he's educated himself on distant places, science, etymology and such, and produced books about them.  This one, sadly, is disappointing.  It is a rote run-through of American history, of the "cherished myths debunked" school of history writing from the Sixties. He's read his Howard Zinn, and it shows.  This dated approach is too, well, too dated to give the expected pleasure to this new Bryson fan.  Politics intrudes most in the final chapters.  For instance, the pages on the Cold War could have been used to introduce a lot of useful terms, such as "peacenik", "peace offensive", and "red diaper baby."  But the liberal Bryson instead renders the contest with Communism as an idiotic greedfest for big business, and dwells on military double-speak from the Vietnam war.  More oddly, he defends the early 1990s wave of political correctness, and its assault on the language he professes to love.  Tepid, euphemism-ridden, colorless, and self-pitying pc-speak was never an invention of humorists, as he claims at one point, though it was satirized in a couple of books he claims are the source of the outrage.  Strange...  Hey, some books should best be left to the pros.  Simple as that 
 I would've given this album 1 star, but I'm giving it 2 stars only because the lyrics are cool. Otherwise, every song sounds the same and it gets boring after a while. And whose idea was it to print the lyrics in a wave pattern?? 
 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books. 
 Ok I bought this as the download version instead of the cassette because I thought I was buying the version that alan rickman reads. instead there is this awful robotic voice that you can hardly understand. I've read the book myself before and loved it and figured it would be that much more incredible hearing it read by someone with a brilliant voice but I was of course mistaken in thinking this was it. Buy the cassette version and don't waste your money on this download 
 Not that I haven't enjoyed the puzzle book - but shouldn't the game guide not make the game even more complicated?  I've gone half blind trying to figure out the maps.  Certainly my favorite is when the master map is wrong, the thumbnail picture is wrong, and the tiny map in the thumbnail picture is wrong.  I feel collecting the horseshoes and photo ops is one of my greatest achievements as the guide is actively plotting against me.  Even the mission guides are of little use, as all they do is tell you what the game already told you, "go upstairs", sweet.  I remember the GTA III guide used to tip you off to the occasional short-cut or some such.  This one both sucks and blows.  I want my $14 back. 
 Do not under any circumstances read this book. I love Catherine Coulter and think her books are wonderful but was sadly disapointed with the Valentine Legacy. The caracters are boring, there is absolutly no romance and no sparks between James and Jesse and it makes for a very long and boring book 
 Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series.  As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really "jumps the shark", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the "corrupt rich guy" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space.  Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead 
 I've been climbing in CO for 30+ yrs and had done part or all of 7-8 of these routes before getting the book, so I think I'm in a good position to review it.  In short, I'd like my $$'s back.  My biggest problem is with the title.  The term "scrambling" has a fairly well-defined meaning in climbing jargon.  Namely, it refers to Third Class climbing where no rope is needed, except perhaps as a backup for emergency use or if one is climbing solo and wants an extra margin of safety.  But only seven of the routes in this book are rated Third Class.  The other 43 are Fourth and Fifth Class routes.  Yes, some are capable of doing such climbs without a rope, but that doesn't make them nonchalant scrambles.  While a book filled with the many excellent Third Class climbs available in CO would be a welcome addition, this certainly isn't it.  If you don't have rope, harness, protection, helmet, ice ax, and possibly crampons, you probably don't want this book.  Related to this is the author's invention of yet another difficulty rating system.  Don't ask me why.  This is a number which runs for one to three.  Even though not stated explicitly, you take the author's number and add two to it to get back to the standard class rating.  Standards exist for a reason and people should use them.  Actually the author does use the standard in the text, making it a puzzle why one would want to confuse things with a second difficulty rating.  I also had a gripe and a warning about one particular rating.  This concerns the Kelso Ridge on Torreys, a very well-travelled mountain.  The author gives it a 2, which means a Fourth Class rating.  I would hate for anyone who does this relatively easy Third Class route with only one short slightly difficult section (near the top) to think that they could then go and do, say, Ice Mtn or Pilot Knob because they're in the same class.  When you read the text you realize that the author's rating is a result of having done it in late March when new snow added to the difficulty.  I might also mention the choice of peaks in the book seemed to be based on no rationale other than that the author liked the climb.  There are some very popular climbs (like The Maroon Bells and The Crestones) sprinkled in with some very out-of-the-way obscure (at least to me) peaks.  Next issue: picture captions.  While photos can be a great addition to a book like this, they need to have good captions in order to justify the amount of text which has to be left out to make room for them!  Otherwise one doesn't really know where the picture was taken or exactly what one is looking at.  While in most cases this rule is followed, too often the captions were something ambiguous/obvious like "entering the gully".  (Like how many gullies are there an any given mountain typically?)  In other words, I found myself going back and forth from the photos to the text trying to figure things out -- which is the author's job.  In one case I swear the order of the photos was scrambled.  I'd rather have more text than pointless photos.  Last issue: the book is littered with errors.  The last page contains an Errata, but even casual study will turn up many more errors.  (Why not *fix* the errors before printing, rather than putting them in an Errata?  The mountains will still be there next week or month...)  There are places where the text refers you, puzzlingly, to a page that has to do with an entirely different climb.  A final note regarding the GPS data: I haven't checked the numbers to see if they're accurate, but I did look at enough routes to puzzle over why certain waypoints were chosen and not others.  Frankly, the choices often seemed haphazard.  In addition, many of the routes are only sparsely covered, with but 3 or 4 waypoints (while others have a dozen).  So while the GPS data is an addition, it's a slight one and not enough to overcome the many other downsides.  To summarize, I found this book a big disappointment.  Maybe a later edition will correct many of its faults, but consider buying it then only if you can afford the price to get a little bit of helpful info on a couple of routes of interest 
 We never got to see the movie as both copies of this DVD that we ordered had problems and would not play on any DVD player we owned.  Amazon.com was very kind in crediting us for both bad copies and even gave us a coupon for a discount on a future purchase for our inconvenience.  (Great customer service!)  You might like to know that we found a copy of this movie at a local retailer and it would not work either.  Maybe it's a manufacturing defect.    Thanks for asking.  It's nice to be able to voice an opinion.  
 I am reading all of the books in this series and this book was rather disappointing, although the monster cinnamon rolls were most excellent.  This one was just a bit of a downer and then I missed Tom also.  If you don't have to read EVERY book in a series you can skip this one.  Janet Evanovich is a funnier, more enjoyable read 
 Borg is new and he is trendy...as Dr. Gardner alludes to in another review here, his interpretation of the Bible etc. almost totally disregards some of the core fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is yet another example of a flash in the pan perversion of Christianity...to claim that Jesus is not God flies against a most central belief...perhaps worth knowing about, but beware...  It continually amazes me how we are all so subject to becoming blind to the deeper truths of the Bible...for anyone interested in a relatively thorough critique of Borg, go to www.equip.org and do a search for Borg. You will find a review of his work which I highly recommend that you read before you buy any of Borgs books.    I bought three of his books via Amazon on the advice of a good friend...anyone interested in getting three of his works real cheap?  By the way, I wish that Amazon would provide a rating of "0' for things that are totally worthless...I struggle to give this book even one star 
 It took me over two months to finish this book. Obviously some serious research went into the perfume making part, but otherwise much of the historical and geographical detail is wrong. This would be nothing if it were a compelling read. It is not. The protagonist, Grenouille, is empty. I did not like him, love him, hate him, admire him, despise him, fear him. Quite an achievement for a serial killer. I did not feel sorry for his victims either.  In fact, I did not feel anything for any of the characters. But maybe that was the author's point 
 This is just a collection of interviews of a few unknown industry "insiders" making comments on what any fan already knows. There are only a few minutes of clips of Britney, nothing new here either. You would expect to find a DVD of this quality in the $3.99 Clearance bin. Save your money for REAL Britney concert and music DVDs, you will see better news stories about her on Access Hollywood or Entertainment Tonight 
 I'm a gamer.  I play for hours a day and currently use a simple MS intellimouse optical.  Well I was looking for something a little more pro, and in my searching I saw the Razer line of gaming mice.  I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with.    It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons.  I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play.  It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably.   Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely.  However, I can't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape, so for gaming, it's rather worthless.  
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 I need something more advanced.  This book is VERY BEGINNER and there are NO hidden secrets or very helpful hints.  Basically is just a walkthrough of the eBay site and how to make a listing - it doesn't really have anything that the ebay site doesn't have 
 with drums, electric guitars, and other loud instruments to drown out the poor lyrics and average band noise pollution. That's my take, and I'm sticking to it.   If you want real talent for words, lyrics and story telling.... listen to the masters. Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Lucinda Williams, John Prine, Gillian Welch, Mary Gauthier.  
 unfortunately, just like their other 2 books, trinny and susannah fail to grasp the concept that there is no possible way that they both have every single figure flaw as all women. some of their advice is useful but overall this book was nothing specia 
 I received the Bjc-85 portable printer. I have plugged it into many electrical outletts in my home and office. The item will not turn on . I was sold a broken printer. I am very unhappy with this product 
 Je ne suis pas une très ancienne "fan" de Mme Browne, je n'ai lu que 2 autres de ses livres. J'ai été surprise de réaliser que le texte avait été "dicté" mais j'aurais dû y penser peut-être. Il y a quelques bonnes idées pour les méditations.  La description du "ciel" semble être du déjà vu...ou bien est-ce ma perception..Je ne crois pas continuer avec cette auteur 
 Steve Fuller characterizes excellently the cardinal difference between Kuhn's and Popper's concept of science and research, as well as their vision on life as a whole. Kuhn was authoritarian and 'historicist' (Things could be no other than they are), while Popper was libertarian and 'criticist' (We can always do better).  Kuhn's basic concept was 'paradigm', which is the 'idea that scientific inquiry is anchored in an exemplar that researchers then use as a model for future investigations.' Kuhn sees a paradigm as an irrefutable theory that becomes an irreversible policy. Therefore, Kuhn's concept is conformist and inherently uncritical. He has a backward look. He is an elitist who sees science as a stabilizing social practice.  Popper's basic concept is 'falsification' through testing, which draws the demarcation line between science and non-science. Science is the standard-bearer for critical rationalism. Scientific inquiry and democratic politics are alternative expressions of an 'open' society. Popper is looking forward because our knowledge is always subject to improvement.  While Popper voiced his political opinions (see 'The Lessons of this Century'), Kuhn remained cowardly silent. More, he schemed behind the back of others (the 'Ravetz' affair) for political reasons.  However, as one reviewer here has already pointed out, Steve Fuller has a dark side, which is also transparent in this book, e.g. 'By failing to associate their ultimate ends with any secular means - be it a church, a political party, or the university - Popper and Adorno effectively crossed the imaginary line from criticism to nihilism.'!  During the hearings of the 'Kitzmiller v. Dover' case, Steve Fuller defends Intelligent Design: Q. Intelligent Design is committed to introducing supernatural causation into the current science paradigm. Is that correct? A. (Steve Fuller) That's not exclusively what it does, but it's certainly open to it. Steven Fuller: 'supernaturalistic means involvment of some kind of intelligence that's not reducible to ordinary natural categories'. This is by any standards a totally unscientific point of view.  I highly recommend Bryan Magee's work on Popper. Not this book, which, by the way, has no index 
 Paretsky is one of my favorite authors, but the reader of the Brilliance Audio unabridged version spoiled Fire Sale for me.  I could not in a million years imagine V.I. with such a breathy, little girl voice.  Also, there are times when the reader seems to be confused as to which character is speaking dialogue and mixes up the voices.  Granted, I haven't listened to much of it, but I am going to stop listening and read the book.  Since I listen to audiobooks mainly while driving, I don't want to run the risk of developing "audiobook road rage" and cause a pile-up 
 American Photo began as a magazine devoted more to photography than to gear, as an alternative to the gear obsessed magazines like Pop Photo and Photographic. It has evolved into a magazine that divides its pages between equipment obsession and cheesy "glamour" photography that tries for art and delivers soft core porn. No stars 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 Everyone (or nearly everyone) seems to love this book. So, we tried it - and had a visceral negative reaction. We read to our daughter every day. I try hard to stop what I am doing and read to her when she comes toddling up with a book in her hands. For the sake of sanity, we've experimented with picture books, particularly rhyming picture books, but really anything with very brief text so we don't go completely mad with repetition. This is NOT behavior we wanted to introduce to our toddler daughter. That said, when she's older and able to understand that the pigeon's behavior is not to be emulated, we might give this another try. maybe 
 I rented this movie from Netflix recently, expecting a wonderfully campy, cheesy horror film. WRONG. Its just an hour and a half of boring film.  The plot is lacking, the characters are annoying, especially Duane.  Its simply a ridiculous film 
 The author Edward Stone did nothing for this book but interview a bunch of different financial consultants then write this book. Shouldn't an author of a book know what he is writing about? Find a book written by a financial consultant. The writing style was incredibly boring and I had a hard time finishing this book. This book did very little to educate me on getting ready to be a financial consultant 
 So I thought that investing in the most recent edition of this book would behoove me, but upon looking up one of the "author's picks," for lodging, I discover that he and Lonely Planet have not updated the book for the hotel's *price.*  This is really important to me, as I work in non-profit and can't afford expensive digs when travelling.    The author and Lonely Planet state that Renakse Hotel in Phnom Penh costs $25-50/night.  I understand that hotel prices change over time, but prices I bought this book fresh off the press last month.  Prices at Renakse are now a whopping $76-100/night and they have been since the end of 2004.  The author's writing style is great, but you may want to pick up an older version of the book (4th edition seems just the same as this one when I read it before getting this one) and save the extra bucks.  
 I realize "A Long Short War" is now a dated book that doesn't need one more review, still...  Having grown tired of hearing how I should read "A Long Short War" because ot explains why the war in Iraq is proper and how the book "is only about 100 pages", I decided I'd finally read it, hence the title of this review.  This book is not really about the War in Iraq!  It says so in the title, "The Postponed Liberation of Iraq".  It is about how Saddam Hussein is a bad man who should never have been in power and that the world would be a better place if he were unable to practice his particular kind of rule.  As far as I can tell, there are not many debating whether Hussein was a bad man in the end, even among those who believe he wasn't one in the beginning.  There is a tacit assumption in "A Long Short War" of the end justifying the means.  Hitchens felt Hussein should be out of power, so he sees the war as a good thing. However, he does not deal seriously with the issue that the simple overthrow of Hussein is not the reason the Congress or American people were given for embarking on the war in Iraq.  No WMD?  Well, Hussein was trying to make them (in Hitchens' view) and there's no question (for Hitchens) that Hussein would have been successful if given enough time.  Still, Hussein's having the time and inclination to make WMD was not the reason for US involvement.  It was the presence of WMD, which many now argue was known to be false at the time.  This is a point that Hitchens does not take up.  In essence, I found "A Long Short War" to be a long short read. I kept waiting for serious discussions, which never came, of whether US entry into Iraq was justified for the reasons that the US supposedly entered. It is a very weak book that is strong on reasons why Saddam Hussein is/was a bad man.  Unable to explain how Congress and the public were not misled into supporting US entry into Iraq, Hitchens merely repeats again and again how bad a man Hussein is/was as though this makes the question irrelevant.  Hitchens is clearly an intelligent man who is up on his facts.  It is easy to see how he and those who quote him can create a very powerful smoke screen, but in the end that's all it is--smoke.  His silence on the *way* the US entered Irag is, to borrow from an old but apt cliche, deafening.  
 While the price for this HTS is very nice, the performance is substandard.  There's a hissing sound when the unit is off.  The DVD player has trouble playing DVDs.  I have a large DVD collection & most of them don't play.  The surround quality is also very poor. It's a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers don't put out much sound.  In order to get this serviced, I have to send it out for up to 3 months.  I bought a progressive DVD player, put the audio through the Phillips HTS 3400 and the video to the TV and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better.   
 I was very dissappointed with this book.  First of all the title is a little misleading ... Taking the Leap.  I was more interested in a book that would help me switch from my current job to a career as an artist.  This book is designed more to help the artist just starting out in his/her career (presumably just out of artschool) to set realistic goals, build a body of work, and guide the artist through the business side of the artworld, ie approaching galleries, selling, copyright and other legal stuff etc.   For what it actually is, the book is about average.  Clearly written, easy to understand if not on occasion dumbed down.  For example, the section on understanding who the major players are in the artworld includes such catagories as, The Artist: you, The Collector, The Gallery Owner.  Including definitions for these terms seemed more like filler than actual usefull information.   Another problem with the book is outdated information.  Mainly where the internet is concerned but also when it comes to the sample resumes and artist statements.   The book has it's good points too.  As I said it's well written and easy to understand.  The section on photographing your artwork is a keeper as well as the guide for creating a submission package to send out to galleries.  If you have trouble with setting and keeping realistic goals for yourself this book will help you with that as well.   I'd be interested in finding out what's in Lang's new book- Taking the Leap 05 (which unfortunately I wasn't aware of until after I bought this one and at the time of writing this review, it's still yet to be released.)  I don't think I'd invest the money in buying the new addition, but I might breeze through it if I saw it at the book store.  
 I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.    A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.    Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James 
 These are either the tracks that were destined to be shelved & never see the light of day. No consistency whatsoever. One star because there's no 0 star option!! 
 I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox.  I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo.  It was very disappointing.  The picture was little on my high def screen.  It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen.  I even tried changing the aspect on my television.  No improvement.  Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup 
 A friend of mine lent me this book, and as soon as I saw the title, I knew it would be awful. The title is practically plagiarized from Jean Genet's 1943 masterpiece "Our Lady of the Flowers" and the plot is riddled with overt correlations as well. I have to say I'm surprised that any publisher would touch a book that was so obviously trying to copy a previous (and famous) work of literature, especially given that "Our Lady of the Forest" doesn't even come close to touching "Our Lady of the Flowers". If you're thinking about buying this book at all, don't. Go buy the original, which IS well written, with a wonderful introduction by Sartre 
 I found this book to be very average. It glosses over subjects poorly, giving me the impression that the author doesn't have a great understanding of the topics discussed. If there wasn't other great books available, or superb video sites like winstructor.com I would then recommend this. But seeing as books like Mastering Windows Server 2003 and Introducing Windows Server 2003 exist and of course winstructor, then I cannot comprehend why someone would feel they got their money's worth with a purchase of this title 
 This is the silliest cookbook I have EVER read.  Sheri Updike doesn't offer interesting new takes on the foods we all love; she substitutes lactose-free milk and margarine for regular milk and butter and claims to have created new recipes.  She offers a "recipe" for Jiffy cornbread mix, using lactose-free milk and margarine!  I could have done that when I was in middle school, but I was too busy baking dairy-free cornbread from scratch!  (Which is not difficult at all--see my review for _The New Farm Vegetarian Cookbook_.)  And did I mention the Updike's writing is awful?  For example, "According to personal taste, as the eggs cook the whites will become opaque and the yolks will harden."  Actually, I'm pretty certain that regardless of my "personal taste," the eggs will cook as above--that's basic science--which, like basic writing, Updike apparently missed.  Avoid this book 
 I agree. A GOOD idea poorly thought out. YOu would have to mount it on a pole or hang it from the celing to get the desired effect. Rex is laser CRAZY and he is not into this toy. I hope they are working on a new design, maybe the mirror should rotate ?  PS. We played with it some more and found if I set it on top of the very high chest it works ok and Rex will be interested SO am bumping it up a star 
 The movie is absolute garbage.  Everyone's a badguy(almost all the characters but Pierce are involved in some crazy plot to blow everyone else up), the acting by almost all involved is horrendous, and the editing blows!  The silly love scene in the bathtub actually has 3 hair style changes where the woman's bangs disappear and reappear and disappear again, then reappear again in bed.  You can see the people running from the bomb threats just falling over in panic, the "bad guys" completely overact and many don't seam to have any reason to even be involved.  Hah, Pierce got shot point blank by two guys with uzi's and still not only gets away, but blows them up and goes on to finish the mastermind off and rescue the girl.  It kind of reminded of a Beverly Hill's Cop(even has the same love interest) without any comedic value and an all B-list acting crew.  I would say don't waste your time... but it does have a certain "so bad it's good" quality.  Just know what your walking into :) (Btw I can't understand how this possibly has a 3 1/2 star rating... it really is bad) 
 I can't say I liked this CD.  Jessica Simpson was good when she started, but as her popularity has grown, her talents have declined.  She commited murder the day she recorded Senatra's song for "The Dukes of Hazard" movie 
 forget the tom wolfe comparison. this book is simply BORING! i'm half through reading it, but i'm still waiting for something interesting to happen. if nobody tells me that the second half is much, much better than the first, i'm going to throw it away (which i rarely do). how could i believe this excellent book review (in a swiss newspaper) 
 The CD doesn't include the software that it says it does.  You have to hunt in the book to find the information that the software included is TRIAL versions only (you can get full versions for a "nominal" fee).  It says it includes excel and excel documents which are simply NOT present on the CD.  DO NOT BUY 
 Scholarly?  I think not.  I looked up a reference to myself on page 19: and this alleged "scholar" did not trouble to ask herself how a French-Canadian politician born in the 1930s, Maurice Champagne-Gilbert, could have authored a French children's adventure story first published in 1914 ("La vallee mysterieuse," which I translated).  (In fact the story was written by Maurice Champagne, 1868-1951.) If she makes a careless mistake like that (which could have been avoided by simply reading the front cover, or opening the book and glancing at the front matter), what other mistakes has she made?  That she relied on the "assistance" of either Nathaniel or Barbara Branden hardly inspires confidence.  The Brandens are about as objective about Ayn Rand as Hitler was about the Jews; though fortunately their unscholarly pseudo-histories have been fully exposed in James Valiant's "The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics."  There may be some value in compiling a list of absolutely everything that's been written about an author.  But I doubt it ... especially in this case, given that most of Ayn Rand's critics either have an ax to grind, or don't think there's an objective reality 
 Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000. Avoid and think for yourself instead 
 In 1980 Michael Weiner saw the publication of Weiner's Herbal: The Guide to Herb Medicine, which states the medical benefits of marijuana [7]. However he recently stated that the chemicals in marijuana make it too dangerous to be used as medicine. On his program, he strongly cautions against the recreational use of marijuana, occasionally devoting his show to "marijuana horror stories" and its claimed potential to ruin lives. He has authored a number of other books on various herbal medicine topics under this name. More recently, Savage's books are political in nature and published by WND Books, a partnership between the conservative website WorldNetDaily and Thomas Nelson, a publisher of Christian books.  In January 2003 he published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The controversial book directs attacks at "media bias", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", gays, and liberals.  Critics have faulted Savage for making a number of assertions in the book that he often fails to substantiate with facts or resources. Exacerbating this condition is the fact that the book itself has no index. The book is divided into two- to four-page sections, many of which are near-exact replicas to columns he published on the conservative site NewsMax.com.  In January 2004, Savage published his second political book, The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His newest book, Liberalism is a Mental Disorder was released on April 12, 2005. Both of these books contained citations of nearly every assertion made, contrary to "The Savage Nation."  In January 2006, Savage announced that he would be releasing a new book, The Political Zoo, in mid-March. [8] The book will contain satirical profiles and cartoons of different people in politics as animals in the "Political Zoo" including one of Savage himself, who will be portrayed as the zookeeper. Savage has remarked that the book will be "easier to digest" than his previous political books.

The Political Zoo, Nelson Current, 2006.   Michael Alan Weiner was born to a Russian Jewish family [1] in the borough of The Bronx in New York City. Michael Savage earned a Bachelor's from Queens College in education and sociology. He taught high school for several years in New York City. Following that, he earned two Master's degrees in ethnobotany and anthropology from the University of Hawaii. He then received a Ph.D. in nutritional ethnomedicine in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley. His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji. Savage spent many years researching botany in the South Pacific, and has a background in alternative medicine. He has stated he was a liberal at one time and never served in the military.  Weiner was a friend of openly gay beat poet Allen Ginsberg, offering to arrange readings for Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti in 1972. [2] Some of his letters to Ginsberg are held in Ginsberg's archives and one of those letters describes an encounter with a young Fijian man. [3] Savage denies writing the letter and called it part of a "smear campaign" by "gay fascists". [4] Savage also once posed naked for a photograph with Ginsberg while swimming in Fiji. [5] Ferlinghetti views Weiner's reincarnation as Michael Savage as "total opportunism," the crowning achievement of someone who was "always looking to make a fast buck" and "always trying to think up new schemes to get famous."  Michael Savage began his radio career in 1992 on San Francisco's #1 news/talk radio station KGO, first doing fill in work for other hosts, then getting his own show on the weekend. Two years later he was given a weekday show on KGO's sister station KSFO where he shared airtime with a liberal talk show host. He chose his "nom de voix" in "the Tonga Islands in the 1960s. I stumbled upon the name of a [19th-century] shipwreck who was locally infamous -Charles Savage. His exploits were legendary," he said. "So the name was bouncing around in my head." At the time, his slogan was "To the right of Rush, and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995 he was given his own show during the drive-time hours. The show quickly became a local hit. In 1999, he came to the attention of the Talk Radio Network.  On January 17, 2000 he started doing an additional two hours of radio which was broadcast nationally. For the next eight months, Savage would spend a total of five hours a day just talking. His national experiment was a success, and on September 21, 2000, he stopped doing separate shows, beginning a full three-hour national show. After just one year, he was in 150 markets. By 2003, he was in over 200 markets and is currently the No. 3 radio host in the United States.  In June 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station KSFO who refused to renegotiate his contract. He was off the air for three weeks. On July 1, 2003 he began his show on a different station: KNEW in San Francisco. Since that dispute, he speaks badly of KSFO and of "Vanity or Pretty Boy" Sean Hannity, whose show replaced his on the station. Savage also speaks pejoratively when referencing his fellow talk radio hosts or individuals with whom he disagrees (see List of Michael Savage neologisms).  As of 2005, Savage has between 8 million and 10 million listeners per week. This makes his show the third most widely listened to broadcast in the United States.  In 1996 he applied to be a dean at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. When he was not granted an interview due to lack of qualifications--less than two years of experience in radio, with a Ph.D. in epidemiology and nutrition science--Savage filed a discrimination lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. The position instead went to China scholar Orville Schell who, according to Weiner, was less qualified than himself.  Savage was hired by MSNBC to do a one-hour show starting March 8, 2003. On July 7, a mere four months later, he was fired for making anti-gay remarks in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller "East Coast Bob."  Savage was doing an "Airline Horror Stories" piece, when Bob called into his show to talk about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom. His next words were "Half hour into the flight, I need to suggest that Don and Mike should take your show so you can go to the dentist because your teeth are really bad". The words after "should" were bleeped out by a MSNBC exec, which would make one believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about Savage's sexual orientation. Savage asked if he was a "sodomite", to which the caller answered "yes" . Savage then said to the caller: "Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig, how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage, you got nothing better to do today, go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on....no more calls? I don't care about these bums, they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages." [6]  Before the show was canceled, MSNBC was replaying his show during primetime hours Saturday night; many believe the show would have been canceled even without his comments, and that MSNBC was simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure from special interest groups. Others point out that MSNBC has had poor programming and ratings performance for a long time and that many talk shows of all different political stripes have come and gone quickly on the network.  
 Unfortunately, the answers it posits to those questions fail the test of logic, for the most part.  (Okay, here I go again, sabotaging my reviewer rating by stating an opinion that many people will object to.)  It makes a case, and a very good one, that the evidence in the Kennedy assassination has been hopelessly bungled. And I'll admit that it's difficult to swallow the concept that that much evidence has been handled that poorly by accident; it's tempting to assume that if the evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone is consistently so flawed, he must not have, and the botched evidence trail must be the work of a massive conspiracy and coverup.  But that conclusion doesn't NECCESARILY follow; none of the botched evidence actually PROVES anything other than that there were incompetents thick on the ground in 1963, and that is certainly true (as is the fact that there are still incompetents thick on the ground in 2005; it's a fact of life: people are stupid) regardless of how Kennedy was killed, or by who. Whether one chooses to believe that it's more likely that there was massive stupidity in all aspects of the case, or that there has been a massively successful conspiracy, is largely a matter of personal taste; as Ronald S. White points out in this book's Postscript, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively answer that question either way.  But consider: if you were the head of a conspiracy to asassinate the president back in 1963, would you choose to do so in a crowded, massively public setting with hundreds of witnesses? Unlikely; there'd be many more attractive opportunities, especially if you had government connections. But if you were a single nutcase with a gun, and this was likely to be your only opportunity to get within shooting range of the president, obviously, that question doesn't apply. Of course, it's POSSIBLE that the plan was to use Oswald as an assassin, and/or frame him for the killing, and so one had to accept the setting in which he could plausibly have had opportunity. But then, the conspiracy theories almost all posit additional gunmen scattered around the area, presumably there to finish the kill if Oswald missed. But if you're going to have to use other gunmen anyway, why bother with an agent as undependable as Oswald at all? Clearly, if this was a conspiracy to kill the president, it was a stupid and incompetent one; itself not an unreasonable hypothesis (as I said, people are stupid, and that certainly potentially includes conspirators) but if the conspiracy is stupid and unsubtle enough to have chosen to kill the president in public with an agent as incompetent as Oswald, thus requiring backup firepower and the requisite amount of coverup to hide that backup firepower from discovery, AND far-reaching and powerful enough to have done so, with sufficient pull in the media and law-enforcement to squash any discovery and/or revelation of these facts, WHY are the people writing for this book still alive? Wouldn't it have been trivially easy to kill them and/or suppress their work without ever letting it see print? Yet that hasn't happened, and while it's possible to posit a sufficiently subtle conspiracy that would realize that allowing some inconclusive claims on the subject would tend to cause people to make the very argument Im making, thus discrediting the whistle-blowers without the need for killing them, it is impossible (at least in my mind) to imagine that a conspiracy clever enough to do that would have been stupid enough to kill the president in public in the first place.   Further, we're supposed to believe that a conspiracy smart enough and widespread enough to get its hands on the Zapruder film almost immediately and to be able to edit it before re-releasing it, could and would edit it so badly that amateur photography buffs would be able to spot the fabrication; if they were good enough to lay hands on the film, and capable of editing it, doesn't it seem likely that they'd have been aware of the limitations of their editing, and if so, wouldn't they have simply destroyed the film and "lost" it, without ever letting it be seen again? Probably, although it's possible that this is again simply a case of "people are stupid", but it simply seems to me that I'm being expected to accept the hypothesis of a conspiracy that is at once supremely clever and subtle (so that only the authors are clever enough to uncover hints of it) while at the same time stupid enough to leave evidence behind that (as in the case of the autopsy x-rays, as described by David W. Mantik, Ph.D., who established that his young daughter could do so) a five-year old could spot it.  I admit it; it's possible. But I find it easier to believe that the trail of evidence was corrupted by incompetent handling at all points than to believe in a massive, incredibly clever, incredibly stupid, un-subtle and bungling conspiracy which has nonetheless managed to keep at least an official lid on the truth for 40+ years 
 The real King David was a man after God's own heart (as testified of in the Bible), but in this movie David is portrayed as self willed, defiant and unwilling to be rebuked. The movie puts at odds David (who is a prophet himself) and God's true prophet Nathan. In the Bible God does send Nathan to speak His word and David hears it as such - see 2 Samuel 12 for a real/Biblical example of David and Nathans interaction. The message of this movie seems to be 'follow your own heart' (as oppose to what, God's word, written or spoken?). The Bible says "He who trusts in his own heart is a fool..." (Proverbs 28:26) and "The heart is decietful above all things, and desperately wicked..." (Jeremiah 17:9).   So my point is "do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world." (1John 4:1) and test all things by "the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work." (2 Timothy 3:15+) and "give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine... Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all. Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you." (1 Timothy 4:13+ 
 Helen Mirren imitated Queen Elizabeth rather than BEING her.  This was a dull, boring movie, which gave us very little insight into the character of this woman.  I do not recommend this movie at all...I don't care what the Academy of Arts and Sciences says.  Don't bother buying it.  
 I've tried this coffee with all size settings.  It is too weak for my taste even at the smallest brew size.  And if it was stronger I still don't think I would care for the flavor.  It just doesn't taste like good Colombian coffees that I've had, not even close.  This is definitely one I would not purchase again 
 I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection ("Trouble is My Business") at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago.  The copy I have is thick with 12 stories.  I bought this copy of "Trouble is my Business" to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories.  My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four?  That's not jake, fellas 
 The problem with this product is two-fold. First, the washable center plate is fragile and can break easily.  Second, the company's customer support is terrible.  I ordered a replacement from the Cuisinart Webstore, but they did not pack it properly so it was broken during shipping.  They refunded the price of the plate ($10), but would not refund the shipping and handling ($5.95) or the return shipping for the plate broken because of their poor packing ($8.45).  I would not recommend buying any products from them.  I am out $14.40 and have nothing to show for it except my original cracked plate.  I contacted several departments of theirs and received no reply 
 To add on to the previous reviewers, I was very disappointed with this camera's performance.  I compared the "5 megapixel" photos with photos taken with my Canon, PowerShot G3 (4megapixels), and the SCD6550 simply did not produce the same quality stills.  The camera itself also seemed flimsy.  The idea of having a two-in-one camera is so attractive.  But another attractive concept, Canon's Elura50, offered a camcorder with a compact design.  In the end, however, it broke down only after a year and a half.  For a $500 purchase that is not a durable lifespan (cf. reviews for Elura50 and you will see that many are having hardware problems).  This camera seemed less durable than the Elura50 as I maneuvered the various parts and dials.  Of course, I am returning the camera before it can prove its durability.  Nevertheless, maybe the folks at CNet can stake their money on it.  Lastly, I should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed.  I found that I had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button.  This definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments.  Again, this camera is a great idea.  But, I suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording.  This one is on the right track, but, still so far from accomplishing a quality product. 
 I find it hard to believe that James Patterson wrote this book. I am a long-time fan, and this one just fall flat...leaving me to believe that he had a little "help" in its writing. Far from the psychological thrillers that he's known for, Hide & Seek is more like a bad daytime soap opera, with a melodramatic protagonist (Maggie) that is so annoying that you almost hope that the murderer gets her...at least that might put her and the reader out of our collective misery 
 It must be fabulous, simply FABULOUS to have perfect children and be practically perfect in every way!!   Yo, Muff. You need to up the dose on that bitter pill and work on that condescending, superior attitude.  It's not quite oozing out of every pore yet.  Toodles now! I'm off to scrapbook, which is really just an extension of what our mothers and their mothers before them did in keeping a journaled photo album of our milestones.  A gift I treasure to this day.    
 While this book does cover composition, most of it is about the history of film and television, and about different styles and genres. 
 The texture of this cleanser is waxy.  I could barely get it off my face, and I broke out badly after using it.  I double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser, and that I hadn't mistakenly put some other product on my face.  It smells wonderful, though.  I tried to think of alternate uses for the product, but finally threw it away 
 Heres the deal - I was told that if I liked South Park, I would like this record and that was definitely not true.  I like South Park and the Parker/Stone films "Baseketball" and "Orgazmo" but I  think this album sucked.  This is an album of crappy music that uses the  success of South Park to sell it.  The only thing I really liked on the  album was the Theme and the Eric Cartman song.  The Chef stuff was somewhat  funny but it was burned out after a few songs.  The music that was  supposedly influenced by South Park is all recycled garbage thats been  heard a thousand times before.  They also put some of the worst bands and  rap artists on this.  Take my advice and listen to it first.  You'll be  surprised at how unfunny it is and how little it has to do with South Park.   P.S. Look into the new South Park movie, Baseketball, and Orgazmo  soundtracks for better music and laughs 
 Perhaps I was expecting too much from the title of this book. There is nothing "unofficial" about the information it contains. The hotel descriptions are very standard guidebook material - lots of facts, but not  enough of a description to give you a feel of the properties.  I have  stayed at several of the properties listed in this book and they could have  easily included some information that IMHO would have been crucial to your  enjoyment. Also, very little information is provided on things to do on  each island outside of the usual tourist attractions. Maybe I am being too  harsh. After all, Frommers and Fodors aren't any better, but since this  book is touting itself as the "unofficial guide", I feel that  it's a bit of false advertising 
 This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep 
 Like I said, avoid this book, at all costs!  I've been doing stand-up for a few months now, with a fair degree of success, and I thought I'd get this book to brush up on some basics.  What a mistake. It reads like a geometry textbook for Christ's sake!   `Create subject (a):  attach Subject (b); where (b) is an opposite of (d), but only when (x) is a variant.  Let's not forget (y), which goes like this:  "Why did I waste money on this rotten book?" `  If you have money to spend, and want to be a stand-up, just buy some DVD's and learn by observing other comics, and not by wasting your time on a book that reads like a physics lecture. 
 I loved Suede's debut album, it's a true classic. I even bought their b-sides compilation "Sci-Fi Lullabies" and loved a lot of that as well ("My Insatiable One" might be their best song). But let's be honest, this album is pretty awful. There are maybe 4 or 5 solid tracks on here but even they don't touch the weakest tracks on the debut.  The theatricality has been amped up tenfold (if that's even possible) but the songwriting has taken a huge dip. If you want memorable hooks and melodies, look elsewhere. If you want slow, pseudo-romantic dirges that go absolutely nowhere, then this is the album for you.   Sure, maybe I just don't "get it" but I don't see how anyone could say with a straight face that this is a masterpiece, let alone Suede's best album. This album is just boring. I wanted to like it but in the end it's just not worth your time. Avoid unless you are a completist 
 I was a bit dismayed with Hook's book because in reality it just reiterates the cliche'd notions we all have about gender and gender relationships.  Bell attempts to influence readers to adopt miandrists beliefs, albeit she does so subtly.  Males do have emotions although perhaps we often don't see that, and Hook's insensitivity to the male gender is subtle, but still ubiquidous throughout the book.  I cannot reccomend this book because like many modern works that attempt to persuade readers to "follow the inner self" this work actually harbors hat 
 I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it.  Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release 
 I read all of David's books and was very moved..however Richard's seemed to hit alot of the same incidents..in either case I can't believe no one ever spoke up to help..I do feel David's books were better written .. I feel bad anyone would have to go through life as they did.. I wouldn't pass this book as I feel it almost reads the same as David' 
 This is good if you need help saying no to your girlfriend when she wants to go to the mall or if your friend Sally wants you to bake a pie for Sunday brunch and you are not up to it.  Not very good if you are looking for help in tough business situations with subordinates or customer 
 When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey. 
 This book reads like something that sat in the author's desk drawer for a few years before he decided to publish it.  The terminology for the submarine, referring to the "King" as the class ship of the Centurian series of US Navy submarines is sort of confusing.  If a ship is the 'class' ship, that is what the series is called, such as the Seawolf class or Dallas class and so on.  Another clue that this manuscript just sat there is a total lack of reference to the 9/11 attacks.  Not one word.  Seems like there would be something there, since one of the stated missions of the submarine is littoral or shallow water combat, according to the book.  All that aside, I was disappointed with the characters, particularly the stupidity of the American sailors when presented with an imposter on their submarine.  I just don't buy the fact that no one notices all the mistakes.  No one notices that a supposedly well trained officer doesn't know anything about American submarines and how they operate.  That asks too much in the suspension of disbelief department.  I won't give away the ending, suffice to say that it was a huge disappointment heaped on top of a pile of others.  Buy this one at your own risk.  If you want thrillers that are accurate, best stick to the authors that do their research, and have actually set foot on board a submarine 
 If you are looking for insight on how to build your business, this is not the right book.  It may be useful for young people or emerging artists.  Many of the tips are related to life skills.  The tips are presented simplisticly.  They are not particularly helpful for artists already in the marketplace.  
 Based on the title, I expected this to be an account of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.  There is certainly some of that.  But it's really a book about the author/war correspondent.  The book reiterates countless times how the author was the first American into Nagasaki after the bomb.  That's impressive (although later in the book we read about someone who got to Hiroshima earlier)-- but the book doesn't contain much substance about Nagasaki.  The rest of the book is a mish-mash of other aspects of the war, and it gets repetitive about how merciless the Japanese were to our prisoners.  Toward the end the book tries to become political and focus on censorship, which wasn't very interesting 
 We need the Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings Trilogy fame, to do this book justice.  The Book MISTS OF AVALON was WONDERFUL - this film was chopped up and missing so much that it wasn't really worth watching, in my humble opinion.  A waste of wonderful actors, terrible job on screen play.  GET PETER JACKSON and his production company busy on this 
 Not much "hidden" stuff in here.  Most of the places they call hidden, is also written in every other tourist guide.  The only things this book has that the others don't in a more comprehensive guide to local  restaurants.  But as for hiking, beaches, etc.  their suggestions won't be  so hidden because every tourist with any guide will know about them 
 I agree with the other reviews that say this book is rambling and padded. It is really just a collection of the author's thoughts on the computer industry, user interface, and information. The first part of the book seemed fine, kind of like the fluffy introduction to any other book. But then it never got down into specifics. I kept expecting it to "get good now," but after page 70 I skimmed more and more. I just put the book down after reading yet again about taxonomies vs. folksonomies and realizing that the author still doesn't have anything to add. I don't think I'll read the rest.  I think this book had great promise. I was really interested in the topic, but the author doesn't seem to have a lot to add. The topic of findability seemed kind of seemed glommed on afterward as a way to try to unify a lot of random technology quotes and tidbits. I also agree with some of the other negative commenters that it is also too trendy. There are a lot of references and sections about 2005's trendy technologies and companies, many of which will not be around or popular in 2 years.  Overall, a pretty disappointing book from O'Reilly, which usually has such high-quality publications 
 I DONT KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING WHEN I BOUGHT THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE SOMTHING LIKE ZANE EROTIC COLLECTION BUT IT WASN'T. IT WAS VERY BORING AND I WASN'T INTERSTED IN READING PAST THE FIRST STORY. I DONT THINK I WANT TO READ THE OTHER BROWN SUGAR COLLECTION. ASHLE 
 I think the Annie Dillard name is the sole reason for this "book" being published.  I write the word "book" in quotes because to call this a book is more than a bit of a stretch.  To me it reads like an old, senile person rambling nearly incoherently about things her mind has lost the ability to grasp for longer than a sentence or two.  I can see only one very general theme come out of this - that people are a product of the earth.  Why does it take 200+ pages to relate that no-longer-new theme?  And relating the theme is all the book does - no explanation, no analysis of the theme, nothing beyond merely stating it in a very long-winded and oblique way.  I hate to be so critical of this work, but I hope to save others the trouble of buying and reading this incoherent mess.  
 Was very disappointed by the performance of this unit.  Not enough pressure.  Pretty useless even with new batteries 
 What a huge disappointment and waste of money!  Janet Evanovich should be ashamed of herself, and I'll know not to buy any book by the co-author, Leanne Banks.  The 2 primary characters fell in love way too fast and for no good reason.  The only reason this rates even 1 star is because there was some mildly amusing dialog here and there.  "Pugg" should have been named "Pigg" because he was a disgusting pig and not at all likeable.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  I can't say it enough 
 This recording is simply DEFECTIVE.  It opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording, and boy, they are not kidding!  This is not a simple case of VHS quality on a DVD.  Instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the 1969 moon landing.  And the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders, complete with pitch shifts..  It is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording.  Even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame.  Some example frames at VienneseBall dot org slash Pirates  This is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance.  I am immediately returning this to Amazon.  This recording should never have been released 
 Good thing I was able to return this book. Way too short and provided lack of important information. Much of the text can be researched online and most of their ideas are common sense. The Appendix they provided are weak. The web sites provide little to zero of help. If you really want to learn more about this kind of business, ask directing to the manufacture. 
 Concept is good, songs are the funk and acid jazz you'd expect, but the cd sound quality is so poor it'll begin gathering dust immediately 
 Battery is way overpriced. Contact Battery Store near you! I did and found this same exact battery type(2-6volt Batteries) for much less. While there they told me I could use a low amp 12v Deep Cycle battery instead. It did take some time wiring (FUSED LINK IS A MUST) but is well worth it. Lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp "trickle charge" with a "amp selectable" car battery charger. All told it cost me less than $60 for everything. It now longer just "Takes Up Space" 
 I could not wait to get another book from Tony. However, this one seems to be missing something. I liked "Bone In the Throat" and felt that "Gone Bamboo" was good as well. This one, however, seems overwhelmingly simple in comparison.  It does have Tony's wit and the food references and the mafia connection but not as many twists and turns as the other two books. We also miss out on the colorful scene descriptions. It's just too simple. If you haven't read Bourdain's fiction yet, start with the other two and then finish off with this one. Tony, I hope the Les Halles cookbook will be better 
 To put it bluntly, the DVD freezes up many times throughout the movie.  I've sent messages to the seller without any replies.  I would not recommend making any purchases from this company.   
 I read the reviews before buying this book and understood some of the objections others had.  Having DID, I bought this book with the soul purpose of finding out the process and struggles Oxnam went through in his healing.  I was extremely disappointed. His constant reference about how he spent two years in exhausting therapy sessions three times a week sent a resounding message about his financial status. Most people in therapy can hardly afford to go once a week.  His need to be special and exceptional was evident by his comment that "MPD" was "extremely rare".  This showed a lack of knowledge of Oxnam and his threapist.  The percent of children traumatized before the age of five is staggering.  Current understanding leads experts to believe that DID is more common than they used to think it was.  Oxnam's constant name dropping and many pages of his accomplishments through out the book was boring and served no purpose.  His insistance in calling the disorder MPD instead of DID was an indicator that he was operating from outdated resources and knowledge.  There is a reason the disorder was changed from MPD to DID and in 1990 when Oxnam was diagnosed, the disorder was called DID.  There is a difference in threaputic approaches between MPD and DID.  This insistance by Oxnam and his threapist put doubts on the validity of treatment.  Anyone who has studied DID and has gone through therapy for DID with an experienced therapist will detect that Oxnam's therapist was not experienced in treating DID.  I was left wondering why the therapist did and said what he did. Oxnam's extreme foul language in the book was not congruent with his constant mentioning of his superior intellect.  Upon finishing the book, I still remained uninformed about what Oxnam's real internal struggles were and extremely frustrated over Dr. Smith's methods. The many pages of Dr. Smith's explanation of DID at the end of the book is a futile attempt to convince the reader that he is an expert which he clearly was not at the time he worked with Oxnam for seven years.  In short, the book is about a very spoiled, weatlthy man's frustration over having DID and his insistance that he be pampered through the whole processes. I actually felt sorry for Oxnam that his therapist strung him along, but with Oxnam's constant references to his wealth, vast intellegence and status in life, I didn't feel too sorry. I will donate this book to the library book sale which will sell for 50 cents which is still over priced.   If you really want to read and understand DID, read Dissociative Identity Disorder Source Book.  It still remains the bible of DID for those who really truly suffer from its effects.   
 This is one of the worst horror movie I ever saw. I just hate it.    People dont waste your money renting or buying this crap.  If you want to see it that badly, just watch it on TV, like I did 
 Then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else?  The songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals, which arguably weren't that bad ("What a girl wants" and "Get this party started" were fairly tame to begin with).  Just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds 
 Easily the worst textbook I encountered during my undergraduate years.  Unfocused, sparse, and almost completely lacking example problems.  Riggs touches briefly on lots of topics and treats none of them completely, leaving the reader lacking any notion of how process control actually works in real life.  I'm not a big fan of the book by Seborg et al. either, but if you have to choose between the two, go with Seborg 
 If you've read Nicci French, you will recognize the opening hook of this book, only Nicci French did it much better (and with a watermelon!).  Almost everything after that hook (young woman performs heroic deed, is captured in paper, attracts attention of at least one potentially dangerous man) is pretty predictable and disappointing.  I'm not really a thriller snob.  I don't mind a little romance thrown in with my suspense (there's a reason I mentioned Nicci French - I like her!) and I don't need a thriller writer to be Hemingway.  But "Beautiful Lies" just really doesn't work even as an escapist book.  The other reviewer is absolutely right that this book reads sometimes like a Harlequin romance novel. (From about twenty years ago.) Other times, the tone makes attempts at doom and foreboding.  Everything is communicated by an overly familiar, "aren't I cool?" narrator who is not in fact too cool -- her commentary reads kind of like your aunt's idea of "what one of those Sex and the City girls might say."  At no point does she convince me that she actually IS cool.  In fact, despite the overfamiliarity, at no point in this book did I believe it was a real person narrating this story, even though that's obviously the tone the author was going for.  On top of that, the plotting was not surprising or new in any way, and every "twist" in this book was telegraphed from a mile away.    I know I sound harsh, but I'm just disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book.  The writer obviously has talent, and this was a good idea that could have been better developed.  Plus, there are occasional glimpses of interesting, thoughtful writing.  But they're way too few and far between to make the other 90 percent of this book worth reading.   I finished this book with the impression that Unger strayed from the book she wanted to write and ended up trying to write a Nicci French book instead.  I wish this author would write the book I saw occasional glimpses of here, when the narrator knocked off the cutesyness and the book got a little darker and more interesting.  I have a feeling that if she wrote that book, it would be good.  Till then, though, I have to give this book a very disappointed two stars (with an extra star for potential). 
 If you're looking for a beautiful book with wonderful illustrations to pass down the generations, look elsewhere.  This book is terrible!  I decided to purchase this book based on the glowing reviews, but instead of a book filled with "beautiful illustrations" and "drawings" as stated, I'm sitting here looking at a one filled with tacky photos of Santa and reindeer tacked on by computer.  Very disappointing!! 
 If I lived in Vermont, and NY, and wrote everyday, and if I cared more about the sweat wicking abilities of my clothes, this would have been a good book.  I live in So Cal, and have vowed to not shop for months at a time successfully.  I thought this book might buttress my ability to do so.  But, I have a viceral annoyance with someone that is okay with asking their neighbors to help them out with their choice of not being responsible for their lack of responsibility.    If I drive on bald tires, I need to have an AAA membership.  If I have a "home" without the basic necessities, I need to make sure I can get through normal climatic changes (um, like, snowstorms in Vermont and NY)without ragging on my "friends" for not being there for me.  I did read the entire book, but only to see if in the end the author told me she should have planned on being more self-sufficient.  She did not 
 I too had this book for a college 19th century art course. Most of the movements were not new to me and I dearly love most art of the period. But for anyone new to it this will be an incredibly boring read, too much bogged down in marxism and political correctness. Eisenman; a self-professed "Marxist-Art Historian" seems unable to speak of any movement without making it into classs warfare or accusing artists of being sexist or rascist, while completely ingnoring the historical context. As with many art history surveys Eisenman also suffers the delusion that there is something inherently wrong with academic art and that the only worthwhile art of the 19th century was made in France 
 This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre.  That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie.  WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best -  wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle.  Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life 
 I measured the reservoir and got only 2 liters plus a cup 
 Bo's way of doing business may work in NYC, but in the rest of the country you would be laughed out of the room.  What a joke.  Some of his great advice is to: wear a fine watch(it's a sign of success),Clean. Shower daily.  Use deoderant and cologne.  I cant believe I wasted my money on this one 
 this was really just okay....i was hoping for more, unfortunately its really not very insightful. i think this is nowhere in the league of some other great books i've read on the subject recently. check out the "emyth" by Gerber, "Start it Sell it & Make a Mint" by Duran for really insightful stuff...and frankly more fun to rea 
 LOL!  Christ!  What in God's name was Patterson thinking?  I read this book because I've been trying to check out new authors.  I fell in love with John Sandford's "Prey" novels recently, and on impulse, I picked up Hide and Seek since Patterson is supposed to be so great and I'd heard so much about him.   Boy!  What a disappointment and what a bad first impression!  The book read like one of those Lifetime Movies of the Week.  Basically Maggie Bradford is this woman who has had nothing but bad luck with men.  Husband #1 Beat her, she kills him in self defense.  She later becomes this world class singer . . .even Barbara Streisand pops up in the book to praise her music.  She finally finds true love. . .he dies suddenly.  While this is going on, we get to find out about the second main character a world class athlete named Will Shephard who just happens to be a psycho. . .and yes, you guessed it, she ends up marrying him.  The book is told from two perspectives: 1st Person when the book is focused on Maggie(she's telling you all about her crappy life), and then it switches to 3rd Person whenever the book focuses on Will.  I won't go any further I don't want to spoil it for people unfortunate enough to get around to reading this trite, contrived, soap opera novel that is utterly laughable.  It's sad when the main character is an abused woman and you just don't care about her.  AT ALL.  Oh, and Patterson, what's up with the 100 or so 3 page chapters that this book has?  
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
 Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either.  Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals.  Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie 
 Please don't confuse this Read To Me series with other Thomas the Tank books.  For instance, Catch me, Catch me is called a Pictureback Reader, and although it is meant for 4 or 5 year olds to learn how to read, my 21 month old loves it--the extremely simple text is all her attention span can take.  The Cranky Day, however, has a lot of writing and is meant for the longer attention spans of 3 or 4 plus year olds.  I don't like the tiny photos for pictures where the text takes up just as much room as the photos, and I agree with another reviewer that the photos are dark.  The full page drawings in Catch Me Catch Me are much better, as are the simplistic drawings in Thomas the Tank Engines Big Blue Treasury. Depends upon the age of the child I guess, when it comes to selecting Thomas books!  
 You are better off getting the Norton Anthology of Poetry.  This book is marketed as a personal selection, yet contains a fairly standard array of poems taken from other anthologies.  Do we need Bloom to select some chestnut by Robert Frost for us 
 O'reilly has a grudge against CBS and Dan Rather. After, GI -Joeing it, standing eye-to-eye with the "bad guys" in El Salvador and Argentina, he gets no airplay. Then  with moral righteousness, he goes to a gay vacation place in Provincetown, convinced a "showdown"  was in the making between gays and het families. He gets no airplay. Too bad. Good for CBS.  O'Reilly's "morality" is psycho anachronistic. (e.g. Hollywood directors & celebrities, unless you look like Halle Berry.)Does a Johnny Depp movie really have to have a *moral* message?  He glosses over social and racial issues, and suggests that Al Sharpton, Susan Sarandon and Puff Daddy are misguided &/or dangerous,dishonest rabble rousers. Aside from the Tawana Brawley debacle, I'd have to disagree. The tone is turgid. The writing, junior high. The book is arranged so that O'Reilly always gets the last word after each interview--which is kind of sad-- especially when he interviews his intellectual superiors, like Mario Cuomo. Bill can't play a game without fixing the odds in his favor.  He fantasizes about Hilary Clinton & that's even sadder: "Each night while lying in bed I visualize the interview. At last we are together in the Zone. Her pansuit is peach, her hair is perfect. . ." He tells the reader he has this dream over & over . . .(Quick someone notify the secret service!)  He dares to invoke Jefferson in one sentence, and then decry "secularists" in another. He reacts violently when he thinks someone is not telling the truth, but he doesn't even give credit to his cowriters, or even acknowledge what's shady an dishonest about himself. 
 Elusive bachelor Lord Devon Boscastle is caught in a compromising position with the virtuous Miss Jocelyn Lidbury, and his life is forever changed.  An unknown foe tricks the couple - who barely know each other - into a secluded nighttime rendezvous at a house party.   Jocelyn thinks she is meeting her beau to receive a marriage proposal, and Devon anticipates a tryst with a promiscuous widow.  Both Jocelyn and Devon are in disguise and, by the time they realize their true identities, things between them have gotten pretty heated.  A group of houseguests then barges in, exposing Jocelyn to ruin.  Devon is a gentleman, so he immediately offers to marry her, and she has no real choice but to accept.  In truth, there is a strong attraction between them.  But Devon has no interest in giving up his carefree single lifestyle to attend to his new wife, and regularly leaves her home alone while he is out about town.  After all, he was kind enough to marry her, he is a good provider, and he is extremely attentive in bed.  Surely that is good enough...isn't it?   I really liked the previous book in this series.  This one started out OK, but then disappointed.  There was not much to the story or to the couple's relationship, other than sex.  They started out as virtual strangers and this didn't change much by the end of the story.  There was very little spark between them, and the love scenes were explicit, but not particularly sensual or romantic.  Devon limited his conversation with Jocelyn, and he avoided her all day long, and yet he stomped and snorted like a caged bull whenever another man looked at her.  He would sometimes do something nice for Jocelyn, or would come to some kind of understanding with her, and then he would spoil it by running off.  This soon became tedious.  Also, Jocelyn's relationship with her father and brother was just left hanging after an intriguing lead-in.  On the plus side, Jocelyn has a refreshing directness, including her approach to lovemaking.  Also, Devon redeemed himself well in the end...I just didn't care enough by then 
 This book is good, but the book's content doesn't match the title. This book wasn't written for people who have never owned any piece of property. The book tells you a couple of nice loopholes and hidden fees most first time landlords will get hit hit with out the blue, but that is it! They have whole sections about owning 30 and 40 resident apartment buildings which is something 9 out of 10 people that read this book will not be doing for years. A lot of the advice that they give such as get a lawyer and someone to look at the property before you buy it is common sense. This book also doesn't go into great detail about taxes and how to set the correct rent level like I thought it would. This book is good for a general overview, but that is about it 
 I did not buy this book for the designs---nobody should, and they are not the point of the book anyhow.  I bought it to review the technical information for my knitting classes, which according to some other knitting teachers, was first rate and unbiased, in this book.   Instead, on page 24, this supposedly hyper-tolerant and unbiased author lets creep in a definite intolerance towards Continental Purling, saying "it takes quite a contortion" and refers to "being blocked by the difficult maneuver".  While she does say in boldface everyone should knit however they want, just a few pages earlier, why then include the various slams against Continental purlers?  It is simply another way to knit, and I am not the only one who does not find it contortious or difficult, at all.   The other reason I do not give more stars to this book, is that the information given is really nothing new---Elizabeth Zimmermann's several offerings include all of the technical information of this tome, including the now-sacrosanct discussion of how the stitch is mounted (leading leg/edge, whatever you wanna call it these days) and have some truly beautiful classic designs to boot.  If you're looking for good coverage of knitting technique, you'll do much better with any of the Zimmermann classics.  
 I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).  It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere.  I do not recommend this book 
 This book is not for anyone at an advanced level- whilst there is a whole lot of information, each technique is described in one page, with very little depth. Some of the examples chosen to highlight a particular technique are odd indeed - why for example, if one was showing how to paint "dappled sunlight", would the subject matter be a building? I may be odd myself (who knows), but the term 'dappled sunlight' brings a rural/country scene to mind... 
 Lackluster writing. Self promotion without a lot of introspection. I had hoped for better 
 The Margarator will process your ingredients to small pebbles of ice and a liquid and then all liquid.  All you will need is ice for a margarita on the rocks.  I am taking the machine back and hoping for better results from a quality blender 
 This is a poorly edited book marred by repetitive treatment of topics.  It is also weak on the description of how conclusions, often startling and counterintuitive, were reached by scientists 
 I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love 
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 Definitely must be a children's book. Written by a child for a child with absolutely no life experience.  I read many books of many genres and this book is completely and utterly boring...Maybe he puts together some fancy little one liners and a couple of odd pairing of words. This is definitely not a timeless novel. Not a book I would recommend wasting your time on. Sadly my boyfriend recommended this book to me and I am quite disappointed at his lack of taste and style. My imagination needs a bit more colors than this. Anyone who can rave about this book has absolutely no clue about art or true writing. It is rigidly boring and a pretentious piece of writing. I don't see how anyone can waste there time on this book...It is really very pathetic and disturbing. 
 The reviews here certainly have a wide range of critics. Just one thought. It's my understanding that things didn't end well for the highly advanced Mayan civilization sooooooo.... my question is... Why the heck would we want to model/listen to/heed advice from ect..., like, anything after them? Again , Just a thought 
  I read this book many years ago and reviewed it yet again at the prompting of yet another Leftist dolt, I found it illogically constructed, breathlessly conspiratorial and vacuous. It is the favored deceit of Leftists that there is some distinction between "Fascism" or National Socialism and International Socialism. There is none. National Socialism in Germany, Fascism in Italy and other state worshiping monopolistic governmental construct has no distinguishing characteristics from states based upon Lenin/Stalin/Mao/Castro's Socialism.    It is a lie that the Comintern invented after the collapse of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact for the division of Eastern Europe between the National Socialist state and the Soviet Union. This cooperation terminated by the opening of hostilities between the two socialist entities. Germany's attack was predicated upon  competition over the east's wealth not ideology.    Reagan and Bush are the defenders of the democratic institutions of the west in line with the founders of the United State while the Left is the heir of a foreign born, degenerate and alien ideology that has produced nothing but slaughter and despair wherever and whenever it overthrows the established order.       
 This book is perfunctory and extremely shallow. Russell's reductive reading of the tradition shows little insight. However, it is amusing at times, hence the star 
 I thought this cover was horrible.  It doesn't cover enough area of the cart.  It's difficult to put on because of all the ties.  I couldn't even get the harness to fit right.  Try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic, you can put them on the cart with one hand, and it completely covers the cart, even the big ones at Costco 
 I was very disappointed in this movie ~ it was a definite "sleeper" 
 This book was ridiculous in its suggestions for "teaching" children to deal with their feelings. Having them "write down" their feelings when they're writhing around on the floor? You must be kidding?! It was a big waste of money. Read John Redmond's books. Now THERE'S a guy that you can learn something from. 
 When I purchased the book early 2003 I agreed with most of the reviews.  However, having it read again. It really shows that a lot of stuff has been outdated and certainly requires updating.  Especially on the new trends like Six Sigma, compliance and innovative technology solutions. 
 The book has an interesting premise, almost like a Shakespearean epic of the turmoil between three princes, but gosh the dialogue is so badly written it's hard to hack your way along after a while.. just tiresome. I'm sorry but it's the truth 
 Unlike the rest of the Rich Dad books that I've read -- which were for the most part fantastic -- this book was terrible.  Michael Lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field, but he is an absolutely horrendous writer.  The intro by Robert Kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book.  Lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of IP protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me.  And no real life examples of anything -- just references to a couple hypothetical "horror stories" that he relays at the beginning of the book.  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least I was able to get some basic definitions of IP terms down.  But I guess I could've gotten that from a dictionary too 
 I feel compelled to write a review to warn people that this is a pretty disturbing book.  I thought the back cover was completely misleading.  The book is about cat death - tons and tons of cats die in horrible ways.  The descriptions are graphic.  There is not a normal relationship between a woman and her cat wherein the woman loves and grieves the cat - it is written with complete emotional distance.  If the author wasn't famous for other work I can't imagine any publisher publishing this book.  Awful doesn't do it justice.  If you want to read about cats dying, written in a completely dispassionate, matter-of-fact, "oh-well" way go for it.  Otherwise, SKIP THIS BOOK 
 I don't know how many horror books the other reviewers have read, but this novel is not all that it's cracked up to be.  Ghosts are seen by characters in almost every chapter, so the excitment/terror/impact is lessened greatly.  The children in this book seem more intelligent than the adults that supervise them -- doctors included.  The real conflict doesn't come into play until 250 pages into the book, and the constant flowery descriptions became tedious very quickly.  Now, don't get me wrong, I loved Nicholson's last book, The Manor, but this is one to skip.  His next book, The Farm, looks a lot better.  If you want a taste of real horror, try Richard Laymon, Bentley Little, or Simon Clark.    
 If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book. Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism. His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong. If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward. 
 The customers and buyers that I deal with would throw me out the door if I  attempted these techniques.  Mr. Ley implies that by simply using certain  magic phrases, you are able to get a customer emotionally involved or upset  enough to buy from you.  I wish it were that easy 
 This book started out well, but it wore itself out due to monotony.   Examples were given over and over and over again about how the main character writes letters to get free stuff and bring about change.    I had to stop reading because I said to myself, "I get it! You write letters to get what you want, now get on with the story."  Bentley Little's books are all very similar.  He takes an ordinary entity (writing letters, convenient store chains, mailmen, college, homeowners association, resorts, insurance policies) and he turns it into an absurd oppressive force that involves violence and sex.  I don't understand why he is so famous or so widely read 
 Oh boy...where to start.  I have a feeling that the editor just emailed her friends and offered them all $100 for excerpts from their backpacking travel blogs.  These are nothing more than 'What I did on summer vacation' themes from the 5th grade 
  Book arrived with more than the stated "edge wear". It was missing pages and the spine of the "trade paperback graphic novel" is broken and loose. This should have been listed in the details of Book condition. Used but not abused is what I thought I purchased. Sad 
 That's right, I said it.  I love this album, and yet I still give it two stars.  Let me explain why.    I am rating this album as I would rate any legitimate album.  I do this because I understand that Shatner was being completely serious about this album, and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man, and blah, blah, blah.  I get all of that.  But still, the album is horrendous.  As you listen to it, you cannot help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album. However, he is wrong.  Horribly wrong.  The arrangement of each "song" is sub-par, the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life, and then there's Shatner himself.  With his trademark delivery, Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track, and that's really not such a good thing.  This album would be utterly forgettable, if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have.  Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review:  THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE, IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE.   I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks, long before it was in print on CD in the States, and even now, when I could have bought it for half the price, it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.  You see, whenever I'm feeling blue, I pop The Shatner into my CD player, and everything gets a little bit better.  It never fails to bring a smile to my face, especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.    Honestly, this CD is glorious in it's sheer awfulness.  It is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it: Shatnerrific.  You cannot go wrong buying this CD.  Trust me on this one.  It's my favorite music purchase ever.  No, seriously.  *Ever*.. 
 After reading her other books as they have come out over the years  I picked up this one. Kurtz really let her fans down with this one.... None of the characters have the warmth or depth as they have in the other books, and Donal, Kelson's grandfather, is a disgrace to the Haldane name.  I got about 15 pages from the end and put the book down in disgust 
 Now that the editorial review is up, you will not make the mistake that I did when all I had to go on was the title. The only difference that I can see: a two-page preface that tells us why the book is being reissued under another title. Since I ordered a new copy of _Invisible Republic_ at the very same time I ordered this book, I am (having fetched it from the post office five minutes ago) more than a little miffed 
 From the moment Celeste met her adoptive's father father...I knew there would be trouble. Not only didn't we find out if she were pregnant...which would have made for an interesting twist...she never heard from the boy she gave her virginity to again! I was really disappointed in this story 
 This author is so deep into tittle-tattle that she forgets to write about her subject.  A judicious editing would have helped this dreary bio immensely 
 The DVD isn't a good abs workout or a cardio video.  The section on obliques at the end is good but only a few minutes.  The instructor was motivational but I didn't find the moves that creative or intense 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this book.  The ads for it were so promising.  It's a terrible read, saturated with TMI in most cases (I don't care what lab did the research, and you don't need to keep reiterating it).  It preaches a hardcore opinion of the validity of the research, and then reveals nothing but open ended questions.  The book tells you how many entrepreneurs answered in what way, and the margin of difference is more often than not, miniscule.  
 Here we have another classic of the brown-bag sound of today's industry. But does it live up to the ten thousand other bands it tries to emulate? *Whiny, flat, talentless vocalist- CHECK! (Also, the singer's young age is no excuse for such bad vocals. Check out Ulver's "I Trolskog Faren Vild", the first track from the disc Bergtatt. Garm was 17 at the time, and his vocals pulverize this Pugh person into the ground) *Falsified, overpushed emotion- CHECK! *Three-notes per song- CHECK! *Unmemorable instrumental section- CHECK! *Fanbase consisting of people who parasitically feed on Myspace- CHECK! CHECK! CHECK! (Endless succession of check implied) Note: For talent, see OPETH, TOOL, ULVER, BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, SIGUR ROS, CRADLE OF FILTH, IN FLAMES, ETC 
 Absolutely terrible. The most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of Dane Cook.   Nothing happens in this movie (and I mean nothing) except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging "comic" glances and looking withdrawn and cynical. I don't think a Soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better. So on that point it's a success. All the sullen, understated lines and glances are supposed to be funny-they're not, they're boring. Somebody needs to tell Wes Anderson that too. ASAP 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 The book, "The Framework for Understanding Poverty" failed to live up to its high expectations. Dr. Payne talks about helpful strategies to improve instruction, such as using graphic organizers, rubrics, and activating background knowledge. She lumps all people who live in poverty into one group, assuming that every student comes to school with the same life experiences. Some of the negatives about the book are that there are more generalizations, rather than facts. This leads to some good ideas but a lot of falsehood. Payne feels that teachers need to let students know that formal registry is their way to getting high paying jobs in the future, and this could discourage children and make them feel less about their culture and background. Although learning academic language is important for students to acquire, they should also feel that their language and culture is validated in the classroom, including their registry.  Dr. Payne focuses on the negative aspects of living in poverty. Instead, she should have addressed ways in which educators can look at strengths and experiences children living in poverty bring to the classroom. Her so-called "framework" is a far cry from what a framework should entail. It is also important to keep in mind that her own company, aha! Process Inc., published this book. She grew up in privilege so she cannot relate to those she is writing about. In order to truly understand Payne's perspective it is important to know that she is a Bush supporter and has contributed thousands of dollars to his presidential campaigns 
 This is my second time to purchase this terrific reference book.  I have loaned it out so many times that I can remember where my original copy is!!  The rotary cutting directions are clear and accurate.  
 ...Or the other reviews.  Those reviews probably came from someone in their camp.  When I first saw these two, I said "no they did not!"  If you go to a music  store it n the rap section and look through it, you will find knock-offs of known and real rappers.  These guys have their names for the simple reason of trying to confuse a would be buyer of Mobb Deep.  These two clowns are nothing more than sucker MC's trying to get a dollar off of someone else's hard earned names.  If you are new to hip-hop or just young, there IS a reason rappers used to talk about something called a sucker MC(a fake rapper, someone without skills, someone you hear and you know they should not be rapping) and these clowns are it 
 I was hyped about them coming back after they rocked on DJ Quik's Rhythmalism.that album was slammin'but this disc is about 5 years past the pull date on style.Up 'N Da CLub is tight.straight up DJ Quik is a Musical  Genius.but he can't pull this disc off Properly.AMG is banging on the track  but overall it's missing something 
 This is a very famous and a very influential book. This was not the first time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than I did when I first became familiar with Kramer's book. What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me. This is not a book supported by research. It is a book of stories. The stories, one after the other, are about Kramer's patients (Kramer is a psychiatrist) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight. Consider these four examples. 1. Sam: "Sam not only recovered from his depression, he declared himself better than well. He felt unencumbered, more vitally alive, less pessimistic. Now he could complete projects in one draft, whereas before he sketched and sketched again. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. Every aspect of his work went more smoothly. He appeared more poised, more thoughtful, less distracted. He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes.(Page x.) 2. Sally: After four months on Prozac, she looked brighter, calmer, self-assured, in control of herself. The most important effect of the medication, Sally felt was that it cleared her head...After ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...More remarkable was the change to her private life. She started going to dances...(Page 147.) 3. William M: The patient's low self-esteem, which had been present since his earliest childhood, began to disappear...On medication William M. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before. (Page 203.) 4. Ms. B: For the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free-floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out...Off Prozac, Ms. B. bar-hopped in search of men. Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings. Dozens of other examples could be cited. The point is, this is essentially the book. It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of Prozac by sharing stories like these. What is disturbing is that I now know the truth. Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically. They are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness, anxiety, depression, and a bad temper has increased dramatically. We have come to believe, as Kramer puts it, "biology is destiny" (page xiv). No where does Kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long. No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is. The dangers of long-term use (diabetes, Parkinson's disease, permanent muscle jerking, etc.) are never discussed. (Of course, these problems were still unknown when Kramer wrote.) See Timothy Scott's wonderful, and unlike Kramer's book, carefully documented book America Fooled: The Truth About Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and How We've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health. Yes, this book has been influential. Thus, Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants. (They do not work as well as exercise even--numerous studies.) It's funny how, as our knowledge grows, a great book beomes a harmful book, but it is just that.    
 "Deadline", while a compelling story that painted an interesting picture of heaven and hell, seemed like one big political infomercial. Alcorn's obvious goal here is not to keep you on the edge of your seat, but to indoctrinate you with a tidal wave of conservative politics and viewpoints. First of all, the story gives off the idea that in order to be a good Christian and get into Heaven you must be a Republican (and not just any republican, but a cookie-cutter extremist one at that) and disregard anything the least bit liberal or progressive. I found that detail to be nothing but judgmental and stereotypical. The "liberal" characters, in particular, were pretty much the archetypal Christianity-hating, moral relativists that the Political Right labels them as. Though I understand this story is not for the "politically-correct" there were some parts in it that I found were just plain ridiculous (the image Alcorn paints of Planned Parenthood and public schools seemed a little out-of-left field, if I do say so myself). Alcorn's writing style is another thing I'd like to address. He puts in too much unnecessary details and information. He could have easily edited out almost one-eighth of the story and it wouldn't have changed at all. It dragged on for too long, not to mention that the ending was a bit weak for such a blunt story. While "Deadline" does make you think about certain issues, I would not recommend it unless you have a staunch conservative viewpoint. If you don't, stay away from it at all costs. 
 In his book The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical Inquiry, Gerd Ludemann examines the question of the resurrection by employing historical-critical methods.  Briefly put, this approach assumes that what is recorded in the New Testament, especially with regard to the divinity of Jesus, is largely the result of mythmaking by those who would benefit from elevating him to god-status.  Additionally, it presumes that the fields of modern science and psychology, along with their underlying metaphysics, should inform inquiries and shape the methods used to investigate past events.  The methodology also requires adherence to Enlightenment period philosophies.  Finally, it tends to reduce historical events and the motives of people primarily to power struggles.  Under this framework, Ludemann analyzes the resurrection accounts found in the New Testament and also some non-Canonical books.  Following this, he characterizes the early Christians' faith in the resurrection as a self-deception.  He justifies this result with a historical reconstruction complete with psychoanalyses of Peter and Paul.  Ludemann concludes that we can no longer be Christians because Jesus of Nazareth did not rise from the dead and that the largest religion on earth is based on a fraud.  He explains, "For two thousand years an abiding faith in Jesus' resurrection has displayed enormous power, but because of its utter groundlessness we must now acknowledge that it has all along been a worldwide historical hoax" (190).  Professor Ludemann's loose and circuitous arguments regarding the scriptures leave ample room for dissection and pointing out flaws in logic and exegesis, but space does not permit.  Instead, I will focus on particular concluding remarks to illuminate the incoherence that results from his untenable presuppositions and method and the inessential and superfluous nature of his resolve.  To begin, Ludemann accepts the fact that no resurrection implies human existence is meaningless.  While he should be following the path of Nietzsche, he espouses hope that virtues can somehow recover meaning.  He petitions, "We strive to create meaning in our lives by living in humility, wisdom, and love" (210).  But why should we live by these virtues to create meaning in our lives?  Suppose some people find meaning in narcissism and selfishness, or perhaps just benign apathy.  Shouldn't they be free to live by those values instead?  Ludemann may say yes, but it seems the author wants to use the imprimatur of Christian virtues to bolster his life philosophy while denying the supernatural God that gave the founder of those virtues his authority and power.  If Jesus taught that we should love others, but his resurrection is a myth and deception as Ludemann teaches, then ultimately the meaning Christians strive to create is groundless and therefore futile.  The professor also admonishes that "belief" somehow points to a weakness in humanity, and implies that it is not appropriate in our scientific age (204-05).  But immediately after disparaging belief, he champions his own.  He dogmatically informs us that he is persuaded to "Live in a house built on a solid foundation rather than a priestly domicile suspended in the sky" (205).  Presumably, this "solid foundation" refers to beliefs that can be constructed only by human intellect.  He further asserts, "Like Bertrand Russell, I believe that when I die my body will rot, and my selfhood will vanish" (210).  Having discarded orthodox Christian belief, he trusts in human intellect, naturalism, and nihilism instead.  The author merely exchanges one belief system for another.  Does he not see his own inconsistency?  Ludemann finally concludes, "Henceforth, I am no longer cowed by the notion that death is a punishment for my sin.  Nor do I hope for a resurrection...Indeed, accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer Easter vision.  Now freed from the undertow of fear and in defiance of the absurd, I can join myself to all humanity by striving in all things to give the best that is in me, and to dedicate my efforts to the welfare of my fellow-voyagers" (210).  In this final assertion of naturalistic dogma, he aspires to greatness in assisting his fellow human beings.  However, he seems to think that his newfound freedom from the absurdity of a God who would raise Jesus from the dead, is what serves as the impetus for his altruistic ambitions.  But this statement of belief is independent of his polemic and consequently his argument loses all force.  I have tried to show, in limited space, that Gerd Ludemann's naturalistic assumptions produce incongruities and self-contradictory reasoning.  Assuming there is no supernatural realm requires him to conjure up fantasies to circumvent the plain meaning and simple message of an ancient text.  In point of fact, I don't think professor Ludemann, in his quietest moments, really wants to live, or die, with his convictions.  The first Christians willingly died for their testimony to seeing Jesus alive again after his crucifixion.  We even know from Josephus that James, the brother of Jesus, was executed for his beliefs.  If Christ wasn't raised, why did all of them die for what they knew to be a lie 
 Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition.  Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling.  White men were all bad, indians were good.  Women were brave.  Conservatives are anti-semites.  Republicans are bad and pro business.  Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy.  This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations 
 I can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but I AM knowledgeable about the St. Louis case, having spent four years on the St. Louis Board of Education (1989 - 1993.).  Simply put, deseg has destroyed the St. Louis Public Schools (SLPSs), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white Lutherans.  Today, after 26 years of deseg, the SLPSs are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of Missouri. Let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as Kozol:   COSTS  Deseg has cost the State of Missouri about $8 Billion between the Kansas City and St. Louis cases. The bill in K.C. totaled about $3.5 Billion when it finally ended, while the St. Louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 Billion mark. (These statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) What have we realized from this expenditure?  First of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in Missouri not participating in a deseg case. Small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. In St. Louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: Yet, those rural, so-called "out-state" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (I'm sure in Kozol's mind they are merely "goyim," and deserve no better...)  Ironically, while less affluent "out-state" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in St. Louis County experienced a massive WINDFALL from deseg: Since they are reimbursed by the state the AVERAGE per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their "marginal" cost,) wealthy districts such as Clayton, Ladue and Parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other Missouri district by a factor of three or more. (For example, Clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.)   ACHIEVEMENT  In the SLPSs, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. This stat would be even worse, except that (I am told) the "LD" (or "learning disabled") kids do not take the standardized tests. There are legions of LD kids...  In a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. That study, called the "Lissitz Study" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the SLPS. That is, they improved less than students in all-black, the "naturally"-integrated, and "magnet" schools.  When the Educational Testing Service still "normed" the SATs between 400 and 1600, the average SLPS student had a combined SAT of 760. Worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who "self-selected" themselves to take the SATs and were therefore, a highly "skewed" sample relative to the average SLPS student.    Deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. Now that even William Coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, ("The Coleman Report," cited in "Brown v. Board,") Kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of "The Bell Curve" in order to understand academic disparities between the races.  VESTED INTERESTS  It has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. This is because the NAACP Legal Defense Fund is a "co-plaintiff" in most (if not ALL) U.S. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed "legal expenses" by the federal courts. These are a very important source of revenue to the NAACP, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades.  Similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. One of the most injurious elements of the St. Louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. The SLPSs now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the N.B.A., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections.   Essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as "domestic" help, are now SLPS teachers and administrators. ("I is a teacher.") How anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but Kozol and deseg's other defenders. If teachers and administrators in the SLPSs were required to take the S.A.T.s, more than half would test significantly below average: We know this because they have already demonstrated the fact!  Approximately half of all SLPS teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teacher's College, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of "higher learning" in Missouri. Last time I called their admissions office, I was told that Harris-Stowe accepted applicants with a combined SAT of 780. It should come as no surprise that recent measures of SLPS student SATs do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers.   HYPOCRISY  A truly fascinating phenomenon I have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. It doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race.   Now Kozol may not have kids, but I'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (The Jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...)  I once had the rare opportunity to sit next to Dr. Susan Uchitelle, the  Jewish woman who headed the St. Louis Deseg's "Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (She was paid $60,000 per year, but from what I could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.)  I considered it an "opportunity" because I was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: "Have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?" (That is, were her kids, who would have been "poster children" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?)   What do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? Your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as Jonathan Kozol...   (I'll give you a hint: Susan Uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like Leona Helmsley's attitude toward taxes...)        
 I just cant warm up to anything on this album. It reminds me of some of the NewAge stuff back in the 80s mixed with some of the candy rock of the time. Like George Winston's piano on "Winter" where the pauses between the notes added meaning. It seems Gilmour was playing with the space between the notes. Definitely not the space between his ears. If you like this try Jean Michelle Jarre or Kitaro. They do a much better job. Lord knows I've tried to listen to MLOR and Division Bell but PF truely died with the parting of Waters. This is just retire money for Gilmour or he as gone by way of Sid Barrett. 
 OK story.  A lot of fluff.  In one  section, "I said nothing" apeared on almost every other sentence.  This book can be cut down quite a bit by getting rid those repetitive sentence 
 . either you like this book or you dont  i dont  --   it exceeded my  BS  tolerance level  imho too much of this is a total crock full of words   if this were condensed to a magazine article it might be worth slogging through  i wonder -  was this once  a magazine article that got put on steroids to pump it up to fill a book?  read it at the library if you must dont buy it  . 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 At first glance, Michael Alan Weiner seems like an improbable candidate to be America's angriest, most vicious conservative radio host. Born 60 years ago in the Bronx, Weiner has lived in Northern California for most of his adult life, making a living as an herbalist and nutritionist. He communed with Fijian traditional healers, got married in a rain forest and studied ethno-medicine at the University of California at Berkeley. He swam naked with Allen Ginsberg, dreamed of being the next Lenny Bruce and wrote a rambling novel about a half-mad alter ego. His son's middle name is Goldencloud. For years, he made a name cranking out a pile of books on alternative medicine, recommending bizarre remedies such as using vitamin C to stop AIDS and kicking cocaine with coffee enemas.   These days, Weiner's more interested in purging the body politic. Using the pseudonym Michael Savage, he's launched a one-man mission to save America from its enemies at home and abroad, which on any given day includes liberals, gays, academics, the homeless, the Clintons, immigrants, feminists, CNN, the American Civil Liberties Union, Muslims and other minorities. Broadcasting three hours a day, five afternoons a week, from a rented studio in downtown San Francisco, he gives voice to the right wing's darkest fantasies. He muses about launching preemptive nuclear strikes on the Middle East ("I wish to God the hatches were open and the missiles were flying!"), suggests gunning down illegal immigrants ("If we had a government, we'd blow them out of the desert with airplanes!"), dreams of dispatching with "commies, pinkos and perverts" and other undesirables ("I say round them up and hang 'em high!") and even paraphrases a remark attributed to Nazi leader Hermann Goering ("When I hear someone's in the civil rights business, I oil up my AR-15!")   Woe be unto those who label him racist, sexist or homophobic -- or even worse, threaten his livelihood. When an Oregon group started a boycott of his advertisers last summer, he became downright apoplectic. "I'm more powerful than you are, you little hateful nothings!" he screeched, before intoning darkly in his trademark New-Yawk accent: "I'm gonna warn you again: If you harm me -- and I pray that no harm comes to you -- but I can't guarantee that it won't." Just last week, Savage fumed about the "brownshirt groups" who dare to criticize him: "You stinking rats who hide in the sewers! ... You think I'm going to roll over like a pussy? You're wrong!"   Such vitriolic ranting is over the top, even by the ever-declining standards of talk-radio decorum. Yet, in this time of war fever and hyperpatriotism, inflammatory rhetoric draws conservative ditto-heads and liberal rubberneckers alike, and that translates into big ratings. Since launching "The Savage Nation" on San Francisco's KSFO 560 AM more than eight years ago, Savage has gone from being just another right-winger with a big mouth, a hyperinflated ego and a sizable chip on his shoulder to becoming the nation's fifth most-popular talk-radio personality, a host with enough leverage to land Vice President Dick Cheney as a guest. His book, "The Savage Nation: Saving America From the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture," has been perched at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for over a month, and now he's slated to get his own program on MSNBC.   Michael Weiner's long and circuitous road has taken him from being a scientist and entrepreneur, through stints as a hipster, novelist and aspiring comedian, to becoming the personification of straight white male rage. Today he likes to play up his unconventional career path, to an extent. He's the kind of guy who never lets anyone forget he has a Ph.D. His Web site reminds visitors that he is a "World Famous Herbal Expert" and the author of 18 books. But just as his gap-toothed grin has been replaced by a row of airbrushed pearly whites on the front cover of his new book, he gives his audience a whitewashed version of his past. The real story is far more interesting, not just for its ironies and contradictions, but for the often disturbing clues it provides about the man now so well known as Michael Savage. He's gone through at least one political makeover. He's turned on old friends, or they've turned on him. If his semi-autobiographical novel is any guide to his own life, he's keeping a few skeletons in his closet.   In the end, the picture that emerges from his books, from interviews with past and current associates, and from his radio show is that "The Savage Nation" is just the latest undertaking of a man who's spent his life trying to get the world to notice him.   Savage's office said he was too busy preparing for his TV show to be interviewed for this article. Earlier interview requests by phone and e-mail prompted an irritated phone call from a woman named Janet, who announced that Savage would not speak with me. Asked if she was his wife -- who happens to be named Janet -- she said she was not. "I am not affiliated with him," she insisted. "I'm just a fan." After a few minutes of testy back and forth, she suggested that it would be unfortunate if my e-mail address and phone number were somehow posted across the Internet.   Savage has come a long way since he emceed school assemblies at P.S. 42 in the Bronx. His father, a Russian Jewish immigrant, made a living selling antique bronzes on Orchard Street. An imposing figure who died of a heart attack in the early 1970s, he is the frequent subject of his son's on-air stories. Speaking at a convention sponsored by the trade magazine Radio & Records in March 2001, Savage recalled getting his first lesson in politics -- and cynicism -- from his dad. "[H]e explained politics to me very clearly. He said, 'You see, this is how the world works ... In this beautiful country of ours there are two bands of thieves: the Republicans and the Democrats.'"   Though Savage waxes nostalgic about such father-and-son moments, it appears that his parents were no Ozzie and Harriet. "I was raised on neglect, anger, and hate," he writes in "The Savage Nation." But growing up with little parental approval or praise was a good thing, he says. "Frankly, that's why I'm driven the way I am."   Savage, who now decries "propaganda about America being the Land of Immigrants," isn't ashamed of his own immigrant parents. However, his Jewish upbringing is strictly taboo. And he often makes Joseph Lieberman, Barbra Streisand and Larry King the butt of stale ethnic jokes. Brad Kava, radio columnist for the San Jose Mercury News and a longtime Savage critic, thinks Savage's ambivalence toward Jews is a misguided attempt to pander to conservative Christians. "He's Jewish, but he always acts like he's Christian," he says. In his book "The Savage Nation," for example, he complains of an anti-Christian bias in America. When Kava, who is Jewish, "outed" Savage several years ago, Savage reported him to the Anti-Defamation League. Dr. Robert F. Cathcart, a longtime friend of the talk-show star, speculated in a telephone interview that Savage says little about his background so that he appears more "neutral" when he discusses Israel or religious topics.   Everyone who has ever known Michael Weiner seems to agree that he has always been a big talker. One of his classmates from Jamaica High School in Queens, which Weiner graduated from in 1959, recalls him as a garrulous character: "He was on the short side, and he was intense -- a fast talker, and always hatching some scheme or other." "The fellow I knew was a natural comic and as reliable as a clock," remembers another classmate, who says the teenage Weiner was "non-political." His yearbook page notes his participation in the Chemistry Lab Squad, school government, and the Rifle Squad, presaging his interest in science, politics and firearms.   Weiner was also something of a dreamer, and he hoped to follow in the footsteps of his hero, the naturalist Charles Darwin. After getting a biology degree from Queens College, he went as far west -- and as far from home -- as possible, winding up in Oahu, Hawaii, where he earned master's degrees in anthropology and botany from the University of Hawaii. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, he traveled to Tonga, Fiji and other South Pacific island nations to study traditional herbal medicine. His new wife, Janet, and their young son, Russell Goldencloud, often accompanied him on his travels. Local healers warmly welcomed him, and he became passionately convinced that their expertise could be used to cure modern ailments. Thus began a quest to salvage-- not savage-- this "ethnic wisdom" before Western influences destroyed it. His research on the sedative kava kava and other Fijian medicinal plants served as the basis for his doctoral work at U.C. Berkeley. His 1978 dissertation, on file in the U.C. Berkeley library, shows his degree was in nutritional ethnomedicine. However, the bio in the back of Savage's book and on his Web site says it was in epidemiology and nutrition science.   In 1974, Weiner moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. His family first settled in Fairfax, a sleepy town in Marin County that Michael Savage would lambaste three decades later as "un-Fairfax," hometown of "Taliban Rat Boy" John Walker Lindh. From there, he started making trips into San Francisco to hang around the North Beach literary scene. According to Stephen Schwartz, who was then a left-wing activist and writer, Weiner carried an unusual letter of introduction. "He had met Allen Ginsberg in Fiji," he recalls. "He had this photograph of himself swimming naked with Ginsberg." Poet and biographer Neeli Cherkovski says Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the owner of City Lights Bookstore, introduced him to Savage in 1976. "All I knew was that he was this hip guy who'd been traveling in the South Seas, finding ways to use tropical plants to help end diseases," he recalls. The two became friends. "We had a lot of fun times. He's very smart, intelligent and very lively," says Cherkovski, who is now writer-in-residence at San Francisco's New College. Weiner told Cherkovski that he dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce and they talked of doing a comedy routine together.   But he didn't make the big splash he had hoped for. Schwartz says Weiner's increasingly bizarre behavior eventually alienated him from the North Beach crowd. "After he had been there a while, his personality began to change. He became much more aggressive. He would collar you and demand that you eat with him, listen to him," he says. According to Schwartz, Weiner openly carried a gun and made public scenes when he ran into his former friends and acquaintances. "He would come into Cafe Trieste and start yelling at me that I was a nobody and he was a somebody."   Today, Savage still has few kind words for his old lefty literary friends. In "The Savage Nation," he writes off City Lights as "that once-famous communist bookstore" and rips into an unnamed beat poet, calling him "latrine slime." "Now he just screams at us in the streets," sighs Ferlinghetti, who once went to Hawaii with Weiner and his family. He views Weiner's reincarnation as Michael Savage as "total opportunism," the crowning achievement of someone who was "always looking to make a fast buck" and "always trying to think up new schemes to get famous."   Weiner did have a knack for combining the promise of herbal medicine with good old-fashioned hucksterism. From his home, he started vanity projects such as the Fund for Ethnic Medicine and the Alzheimer's Research Institute, which he plugged on his book jackets and in letters to the New York Times. He concocted feel-good beverages like Tea of Life and Herbal-Seltzer and sold a line of herbal supplements from a Web site called Herbs That Heal. Visitors to the now-defunct site were welcomed with photographs of Weiner collecting herbs in the South Pacific, soulfully soaking in the culture of what Michael Savage belittles as the "turd world." The 1992 edition of "The Herbal Bible," published by his wife's imprint, Quantum Books, modestly noted that its author was "credited with starting the herbal revolution."   He was also a prolific writer, churning out 18 titles in 20 years. "[D]on't assume for a minute that they were junk books and marginally published," he snaps in "The Savage Nation." "They weren't. They were top of the line. They were the Rolls-Royce of the field." "Earth Medicine -- Earth Foods" and "Weiner's Herbal" are well-respected references and are still cited widely on herbal and homeopathic Web sites. Most of his books, with their glorified lists of plants and their properties, are about as dry as a handful of powdered dogwood root (which, according to Weiner, makes a good tonic for treating fevers). But buried in the details is a sprinkling of flaky affirmations and kooky assertions.   For example, in "Plant a Tree: a Guide to Regreening America," Weiner wrote dreamily about our "plant allies" and suggested that every state appoint its own "tree czar." "Dictators seem to like trees," he ruminated. "Who knows what a benevolent, nature-loving tyrant might do for the retreeing of America?" In "The Way of the Skeptical Nutritionist," he ventured that a person's ideal diet should be determined by his or her ethnicity. "Getting Off Cocaine: 30 Days to Freedom" promised blow addicts "an alternative plan for getting 'high' -- legally and naturally!" The treatment involved ingesting a daily cocktail of Sudafed, vitamins C and E, and amino acids, as well as self-administering the occasional coffee enema. "Use a good quality coffee," Weiner advised. "Not decaffeinated or instant."   Michael Savage's homophobic rants against what he calls "anal rights" were foreshadowed by the 1986 book "Maximum Immunity." In it, Weiner glommed onto some of the wilder ideas about AIDS that were circulating at the time. He called for mandatory nationwide AIDS testing and suggested using massive doses of vitamin C to slow down and even reverse the disease's progress. When he was done suggesting cures, he looked for scapegoats. He demanded that gays "accept the blame" for the rise of AIDS, then grumbled, "Those who practice orgiastic sex, with many partners, and use street drugs are not likely to respond to reason."   "Maximum Immunity" also hinted that its author was dealing with some heavy issues of his own. In one passage, Weiner wrote about his decision to take up jogging so that he might avoid his father's untimely fate. Everything went well until he started hearing things. "An inner 'voice' began to demand, 'Stop ... I can't take this anymore.'" he wrote. Fearing a "nervous collapse," Weiner traded his running shoes for a bike and soothed his jangled nerves by curling up on the sofa with a mug of passionflower herbal tea and ingesting "megadoses" of vitamins. Feeling much better, he concluded: "I learned to calm the inner debate that had threatened to drown me in madness!"   Such extreme mood swings are regular occurrences on "The Savage Nation." Even the phrase "I can't take this anymore!" (usually shouted at full volume) has become a Savage catchphrase. James Hilliard, who produced "The Savage Nation" at KSFO for nearly three years in the late 1990s, says that talk radio provided Savage with an outlet for his unpredictable temperament. As he recalls, "The show was really driven by Michael's mood. At times, he could be very quiet, mellow, low-key, and then be a maniac on the air."   This maniacal tendency, and the roiling emotions that fueled it, were laid bare in "Vital Signs," Michael Weiner's first and only book of fiction, published in 1983. A collection of confessional, stream-of-consciousness stories, it follows the exploits of Samuel Trueblood, who just happens to be a 40-ish New York Jew, an herbalist and writer with a tumultuous personal life, a substantial assortment of inner demons and a bit of a Napoleon complex. "I am physically not tall, but my eyes burn with fire," he states. "Two black fires of Hell." Trueblood narrates a series of misadventures, from procuring an illegal backroom abortion for his fiance to beating the stuffing out of an abusive cop.   Trueblood describes his life as one long search for inner peace. He blames much of his discontent on his "childhood beneath tyranny," during which he was cowed by his bullying father. Trueblood describes how his father mocked him with "brutal jokes and chides, 'gentle' kidding: 'You're not a fag, are you Sam?' the little man would say each time the boy dared wear a colorful shirt or flashy trousers." Unable to shake his dead father's disapproving influence, the adult Samuel is tortured by feelings of weakness and inadequacy. "I am filled with fears," he admits, "nearly all the time feeling I am about to become totally insane."   Even after moving to mellow Marin County, becoming a successful herbalist and starting a family, Trueblood remains plagued by his "underlying sadness." Not even trusty passionfruit tea can bring him off this bummer. In one passage, he almost loses it in front of his wife and two young children:   "Inner voice screaming at me for years, first rational, then crazy, telling me to do mad things. Every form of relief tried, painting, psychotherapy, running, diet, vitamins, etc., etc. Almost uncontrollable now. Impulses to stab children, strangers, wife, self with scissors."   Eventually, Trueblood seeks solace in chasing skirts. (Though he admits to being drawn to "masculine beauty," he confides that "I choose to override my desires for men when they swell in me, waiting out the passions like a storm, below decks.") While his wife stays home with the kids, he beds a young "cockswell" with a "dykish haircut" and skin "[s]ofter than that Northern Indian prostitute in Fiji whose covering was as soft as that of my own penis." And so it goes for another 50 pages.   No doubt the anti-abortion, anti-gay, pro-family Michael Savage would disapprove of such a perverted excuse for literature, with all its gratuitous references to illegal abortions, repressed homosexuality and shameless philandering. But it's impossible not to notice the similarity between Trueblood, the tormented seeker, and Savage, a man whose "inner voice" precipitated an existential crisis over jogging. Neeli Cherkovski says that the chapter in "Vital Signs" about Trueblood's father is based on Weiner's own life, recalling that he went with the author back to the Bronx to see the site of his father's store. But Cherkovski won't speculate about the rest. "I think he [Weiner] is a person who had a lot of wild experiences," Cherkovski says. "He tested a lot of waters." Even the book's dedication, to Weiner's wife, suggests that he wasn't making everything up: "Who would listen to such tales and live with he who lived them but she, the unshakably faithful Janet."   For most of the 1970s and 1980s, Weiner focused on curing people's illnesses, not society's ills. "For 10 or 15 years, I was the revered herbal doctor," he recollected at the Radio & Records convention. "I was Mr. Nice Guy Nutritionist. Nobody knew my politics. I was talking about healing and I'd go to health food conventions and I'd give speeches about vitamins and herbs. Nobody ever saw this as controversial ... They liked me!"   But beneath the surface, Weiner was becoming more and more conservative. Stephen Schwartz, who went from being a self-described Trotskyite to neoconservative and is now senior policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, says that Weiner was a "typical left liberal" in the 1970s. Neeli Cherkovski, who is gay, notes that Weiner was not homophobic when they first met. However, he says Weiner's shift rightward coincided with his increasing aversion to gay activism. Robert Cathcart, who's been close to Weiner since the mid-1980s, says he's always known his friend as an outspoken conservative, at least in private.   Since Weiner's conservative leanings took a hard right turn, he's complained that he was held back because of his race, gender and political beliefs. He currently gripes that no institute of higher education would hire him, despite his qualifications. "I discovered I could not gain a professorship even after applying many times," he writes in "The Savage Nation." "My crime? I was a white male." The rsum he has presented over the years tells another story. On air, he's mentioned that he was once affiliated with Harvard. On the back of his books, he has boasted of being a faculty member at U.C. Santa Cruz, a visiting scholar at the Hebrew University School of Pharmacy and a senior research fellow at the University of Heath Sciences at Chicago Medical School. He's also claimed to have done "important research" for the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. Not bad for someone who's been blacklisted from the ivory tower.   The last straw apparently came in 1994, when publishers rejected Weiner's latest manuscript, "Immigrants and Epidemics," which contended that infectious diseases such as T.B. were being brought into the U.S. by Southeast Asian immigrants. Fed up, Weiner rented a recording studio in Sausalito and produced a mock talk show with his wife and a couple of buddies playing callers. Michael Savage was born.   In his new job, Savage employed all the self-promotional tricks he had picked up while going from Charles Darwin wannabe to world-famous herbal expert. In early 1996, he applied to become dean of the U.C. Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. Unable to appreciate the journalistic qualities of Savage's radio program or his 18 books, his alma mater denied him an interview, instead hiring China scholar and journalist Orville Schell. Savage sued Berkeley with the help of a conservative legal fund started by David Horowitz (who wrote approvingly of the case in Salon), accusing it of discriminating against a conservative in favor of a man he has called a "front for the communist Chinese mafia." The case never went to trial. During the run-up to the 2000 election, Savage laid claim to the phrase "compassionate conservative," and said he planned to sue George W. Bush for intellectual property theft. Like many of Savage's threats of imminent litigation, this one soon faded away. But sure enough, he had self-published a book called "The Compassionate Conservative Speaks" in 1995 and, ever the savvy businessman, had trademarked the term in 1998.   Even Savage's two kids were swept up in his relentless drive for publicity. His Web site advertised Rockstar, a liver-cleansing beverage marketed by his son that enables its drinkers to "party like a rock star." Last spring, Savage told his listeners about a third-grade teacher in San Diego, Calif., who had saved a child from choking, and demanded that the state school superintendent give her an official commendation. "If she was a minority teacher and picked up a paper clip on the floor, then a commendation would be in order," he sniped. He neglected to mention that the "hero teacher," Rebecca Lin Yops, was in fact his daughter, who had changed her last name after her recent marriage.   Armed with his natural loquaciousness and a kill button, Savage's love affair with the sound of his own voice deepened. Obsequious fans obliged him by calling him "Doctor Savage," prompting him to expound his theories on how gays and immigrants spread disease and were corrupting the nation. "It's the greatest revenge there is, having a talk show," he crowed in "The Compassionate Conservative Speaks." And as his rhetoric became ever more grandiose and outrageous, his ratings -- and political clout -- grew. "The Savage Nation" became the Bay Area's No. 1 drive-time radio program. Savage lunched with Democratic San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and started landing big-name conservative guests such as Benjamin Netanyahu and Vice President Dick Cheney, who, apparently unaware of the show's usual host-centered format, commended Savage for "providing a forum where we can have a good discussion."   Looking for a way to leverage his newfound influence, Savage founded the Paul Revere Society, a political club whose goals have included the imprisonment of antiwar activists for sedition, loyalty oaths for immigrants and the eventual establishment of "a haven for compassionate conservatives" called "Revere-Town." A fee of $40 gets new members a Savage Nation baseball cap and an anti-affirmative action pamphlet called "The Death of the White Male." There's also the promise that one day they might get to meet the founder and executive director in person. But given Savage's reclusiveness, they may have to wait a while. The group's last major event took place in November 2000, when it held its fifth annual "Compassionate Conservative Convention" in San Rafael, not far from Savage's home. Since then, Savage made himself available to fans only at dinner parties, and only after they forked over more than a hundred bucks. Meanwhile, according to papers filed with the IRS, this nonprofit "educational organization" took in over $150,000 in donations in 2001 and expects to take in $250,000 this year.   The success of "The Savage Nation" and its spinoffs is the culmination of a lifelong quest for attention, fame and money. And that raises the question of whether Michael Savage is just a persona created to milk conservatives and taunt liberals. Robert Cathcart thinks his old friend intentionally exaggerates his politics and personality to get a rise out of his audience. "It's showmanship," he says. "He makes enemies of everybody. He doesn't believe half the stuff he says. On air, he's the ultimate type-A personality, but he quiets down at home." Former "Savage Nation" producer James Hilliard concurs. "I think Michael does have an excellent sense of putting on a show," he says. "I think he learned or was told at an early point that this is an entertainment medium, and he thought of himself as an entertainer."   However, as Savage rips into another hapless caller or gets exercised about the latest liberal atrocity, it often feels like he's crossed the line between public shtick and personal catharsis. On the air, he lets everything hang out, truly living up to the warning of "psychological nudity" advertised at the beginning of every show. This is what makes "The Savage Nation" so simultaneously maddening and fascinating -- as Savage heads over the brink one more time, you have to wonder whether someday he'll go over for good. Cathcart and Hilliard are right when they say the show is not just about politics. But it's not just about entertainment, either. It is about one man grappling with his ambitions and fears while America listens. For Michael Weiner, talk radio is the ultimate talking cure.   
 If you own cats, and are interested enough in cats to actually buy and read this book, the only things that will strike you as new ideas are Newkirk's dogmatic beliefs about the welfare of our feline friends.  As a long-time vegetarian, bordering vegan, I have little problem with the suggestion that cats can be mostly vegetarian. However, a strict vegetarian diet isn't best for *most* cats, and can cause - in some cats, particularly males - struvite crystals in the bladder which are excreted, painfully, in their urine. This is because a plant diet does not have the acidity that a meat diet has - not because of a deficiency in protein, fat, or nutrients - as some reviewers suggest. Specially formulated, highly acidic brewer's yeast can help in this area, but a fail-safe method is to incorporate small amounts of meat, and do a heck of a lot of research. For example, our cats are pesco-vegetarians, and thrive on a diet of Evolution dry kibble - with small amounts of salmon or tuna every few days.   My biggest problem with Newkirk's take on cats is that they should be kept 100% indoors, and the assertion that death (is that the 250th thing you can do to make your cat adore you?) is a preferable alternative to allowing a cat to roam outdoors. I imagine Newkirk doesn't have children, and this is a lucky thing, because she would likely lock them in a padded cell for fear that they might stub their toe. Or maybe she'd just kindly euthanize them? Eeks. Not all cats are happy being indoor cats, and one has to decide if the possibility of death, perhaps in painful circumstances, is worth the risk when this is the cat's inclination and the only way some cats are truly happy.   Of course this doctrine comes from an animal rights group that has been noted for euthanising 85% of the animals it takes in - a far greater number than many public animal shelters (San Francisco Chronicle, June 23, 2005). And that, honestly, is my biggest gripe with this book, and with PETA in general. Hypocrisy of this sort - PETA is riddled with it - leaves me feeling we have the wrong group representing the rights of companion and farm animals, and that ultimately Newkirk's poorly researched, dogmatic ideas leave us all (animals rights activists) looking like a bunch of nuts 
 This book was very bizarre. It was recommended by a friend who said it was her favorite book of all time. I honestly couldn't wait until it was over and I almost stopped reading before page 50. A soulless, scentless perfumer in 18th century France becomes a serial killer in order to extract the unique scents of his victims and create the ultimate perfume. The point of the book (if there is one at all) is that human beings are nothing more than easily manipulated animals, victims of our own instincts and physical desires, and that our arrogance of anthropological superiority is an illusion.  
 This was sent via USPS and I never received it!  I urgently needed it.  I would've thought that Amazon would've used a shipping company that requires a signature at least 
 it's a little confusing to use and it's very easy to stop the wrong timer running because it doesn't automatically switch to the time going off.  But the worst is it's whisper quiet.  I bought this item for a professional bakery and the noise level is high.  If your running your home mixer and the timer goes off unless your right by it you won't here a thing.     
 While very convincing and moving in its presentation, this book contains ideas that could have potentially damaging effects on a believer's life.  I was so distraught after seeing the effects that this line of thinking had  among some believers that I know that I took my copy out and burned it.   Don't waste your money 
 This book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but... there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either  a technical guide (see Wasserman and Faust) or a sociological simplification 
 I've generally liked Cherry Adair's series about the Wright family, but found myself skipping through huge chunks of this book to get to the parts with plot.  Found the Iditarod backdrop interesting, but little else.  Just a few things that don't make sense to me...  - In today's world, how many women are so afraid of passion that they would run off and marry some guy just to avoid his best friend, who turned her on too much? - Is it truly likely that a hotshot secret agent, a man used to taking control and having things his way, would let the woman he obsessed over marry another man - who he knows to be a bad guy - without a fight? - Why would the hero respect a woman more because she wasted three years of her life providing hospice care to her philandering criminal husband, rather than leaving his sorry [...]?  There's nothing to be respected about a doormat.   One final thought. If ever I find myself in a situation where I, a random civilian, am having to do battle with terrorists - and I'm lucky enough to have a trained anti-terrorist agent there to help - I will do what he says.  Without question, without hampering him by trying to protect him, I will do what I am told by the trained expert in the belief that he knows better than I do what will get us both out alive. 
 I honestly hate Kidz Bop. I mean, Avril Lavigne is my favorite singer, and My Happy Ending is too good of a song to be wrecked by Kidz Bop. I mean, I sing in the shower better then these kids! Don't buy it. Borrow it from the library if you must. 
 Monica Keena's colagen lips were bigger than this movie's budget. The acting was decent considering its poor script and dialogue- Way to go Monica. No monsters. No darkness. Heaven and Hell consists of nothing more than recycled scenes. Nothing is scarier than realizing how much time you wasted watching it. There's no deep spiritual realization that everyone else claims. - Overall this film was lame. Rent "High Tension" if you're looking for fright or "Kolobus" for lower budget horror. Both  are great!!! 
 this movie is part Canadian soap opera and part effective slasher movie. The plot is a ripoff of THE PROWLER, or vice versa (either way, the prowler is a MUCH better movie, go see that instead). It deals with a vengeful wraith promising to spree if a valentine's party is ever held after a tragic holiday party-to-blame accident in a coal mine left one survivor to resort to cannibalism and unemployment. Of coarse you know them crazy kids  go and party anyways. Basically, anything to do with the killer miner or the mine itself is great, but everything else is just plain tacky. John Stanley of the Creature Features guide gave it 4 stars...I've decided that anything he says is good is automatically bad. I can't believe that a Band actually decided to ripoff this particular piece of pop culture to sell records. Its not because they were on drugs but because they were in the imagination-less state of NOT doing drugs 
 I have not read this book but I am a real life Eunuch. I had my testicles surgically removed. In an Interview on Salon.com the author says "Castration does not get rid of the sexual drive, get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity." WRONG!!!  How would he know any way? He is NOT a Eunuch. He has had a vasectomy but that is totally different. I can speak from experience; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero. I had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone. The only way for a Eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement. I have never heard of any real life Eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive. Don't waste your time on this book; the author obviously didn't do enough, if any research. If you want to learn about Eunuchs then search the web. There are a lot of us out there, and our numbers are growing 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 Yesterday I helped my 10th grade sister with Politics and the English Language by George Orwell. I explained to her why Mr. Orwell says a double negative is bad English.   I highly recommend all the contributors to this book begin with the basics of writing in the English language. Strunk & White is a good read and not too long and I also recommend Mr. Orwell's essay to elucidate exactly why not not is not not not good English.   The most aggravating aspect of this book however isn't the piss poor English. I have school books for my MA in publishing I am supposedly to learn from that are full of grammatical and spelling errors every other page. It happens. I can deal with that.   No, the worst part of this book are the factual errors that just make me want to throw the book out the window in a fit of rage at the sheer lack of research put into it.   Don't believe me? On page 626, the author predicts that in possibly five years technology may be available that will prohibit users from making photocopies of protected material and that this technology may be commercially viable in seven to ten years.   If the author did the slightest amount of research, he would know the technology is already widely used and has been for nearly a decade. The article on wikipedia about the EURion constellation can provide you all the details.  You know I'm really trying to give the book a fair chance. It is a textbook after all, and I am trying, I really am, but I continually question the intelligence of the authors and their competence in the field they are supposed to be experts in every other paragraph.   Don't buy this book. And if you need it for school, photocopy the parts you can stomach to read.  
 Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money 
 Finishing this book was a lesson in patience. Don't bother with this waste of paper, there are many other fine writers of christian leaning--g.k.chesterton and t.s.eliot come to mind--who can write without egregious fallacies. First, RavZac asserts that his book counters the 'steady barrage of scholarly attack' which 'has been foisted upon religion' in general, and on christianity in particular (p xiv). Paradoxically, he then goes on to quote Kant's assurance(as representative of modern antitheistic thought)(p9) that spirituality is not threatened by Kant's antitheistic philosophies, and also acknowledges that modern thought has been a natural evolution of human history (p6). Second, RavZac continually correlates societal ills with modern intellectualism (p xiv,xvii,8,12,et al), and actually asserts causality between the two (p xvii,8,22-33). Then, he states that 'every generation raises the issue of life's essence' and discusses the long history of humanity's existential angst. If dissatisfaction with life is universal in all times and places, and if the history of humanity is the history of pleasure as well as pain, then where does RavZac get off when he tries to pin it all on modern intellectualism and philosophy? Finally, he states 'that all philosophizing on life's purpose is ultimately two conclusions, Does God exist? and What is his character?'(p8) He may hold such a view, however he seems to be ignoring a vast record of philosophy that does not presuppose a theistic view, let alone the monotheistic variant. RavZac is atrociously unrigorous in his sophomoric attempt at conversing with the great philosophers.  The foregoing should show that one needn't get very far into his book before being stumbled at his profusion of ineptitude. The entire writing has so borrowed pseudo-biblical language as to be cloying, and RavZac thoroughly conveys his paranoid rhetoric by overutilizing key words such as 'warned, aberrant, terrifying, unbridled, unleashed, attacks, machinations, trickery', etc. ad nauseum. In short, this book is the religious version of political paranoia as discussed in Richard Hofstadter's THE PARANOID STYLE IN AMERICAN POLITICS, 11/64.  There are no redeeming features of this writing, save for giving the lucid reader abundant opportunities to identify logical fallacies and monitoring the addled ramblings of today's christian writers. 
 I was expecting this to be a fantastic book after reading some of these reviews.  I found this book to be a real struggle to get through.  It started off quite well but soon became quite boring. There were still so many unresolved issues in Faith's life by the end of the book that it really left you hanging. It shocked me when she revealed that she had not told anyone about the Homecoming incident. I just don't think that is realistic after what she went through. I would not recommend this book 
 Working in the banking industry I was turned on to this book by a colleague and what a colossal waste of time reading this was.  The vast majority of this book's models are outdated and if Mr. Saunders was trying to write a historical piece he has accomplished that in spades.  Nothing in this book is relevant and it is obvious the esteemed Mr. Saunders lent his name to a very poor book that he probably should have glanced through if not read.  Linda Allen should probably get some real world experience because she is wasting people's time with her research 
 If your left - handed this book is NOT for you. I thought a lot of the projects were to advanced for beginners. 
 This pillow is EXTREMELY overrated!!  I have slept better on a cheap Walmart pillow. It did nothing for me or my husband after a week. The tag on the pillow itself says "100% polyester fiber" which is what is in your common $5.00 pillow. It does not say on the label "50% holofiber and 50% super slick fiber" as it advertises above. Its nothing more than a placebo and they hope you fall for it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! 
 I read this book because it was supposed to be one of Heinlein's classics.  I liked several of Heinlein's early works and thought I'd try this one, although I heard it was controversial.  After reading it, I can see why.  I cannot recommend this book.  It is not a classic, and if it wasn't written by Heinlein it probably wouldn't have been published, and if it was published, would have been forgotten long ago.  Other reviewers state that this is a book that questions social customs.  I'm sorry, but stories about time travel in which the protagonist meets and beds his mother as a young woman are not questioning social norms, they are the rantings of a dirty old man.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' this is not.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long are entertaining, but they don't make up for the poor quality of the rest of the text.  I regret spending money on this book, and I really regret losing the time I wasted reading it.  7MAY06 - I've added to this review after receiving a few not helpful votes, because, in part, I was concerned that my original review was too terse.  My opinion about this novel has not changed.  This is a series of stories about the life and adventures of Lazarus Long, a man who has lived thousands of years and experienced, effectively, multiple lives.  That is, he has loved, married, and 'built a life' several times.  He has now grown weary of the tedium of life and is contemplating suicide.  The novel consists of dialogue with some of his living decendants as he tells the story of his life.  Stories, really.  Each major section in the book is a vignette in LLs life.  In theory, this was a very good idea for a sci-fi novel, but in practice, this novel is simply tripe.  There are several things that I really dislike about this novel and would not recommend it to anyone.  Like much of Heinlein's later writings, this novel explores alternate family relationship (i.e. a code for incest).  As I mentioned above, one of the vignettes involves LL travelling back in time to bed his mother.  Another relates a `complex' (i.e. sexual) relationship between brother and sister.  Additionally, most of the novel is dialogue between the characters, there isn't much action.  I generally view this as a strength, not a weakness, but in this case the dialogue can be classified only as mindless banter loaded with sexual inuendo and overtone.  The characters on Beverly Hills 90210 had better lines.  If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, this is NOT IT.  This is really a novel about alternate family relationships with some sci-fi elements (e.g. longevity and time travel) in the plot.  There are some who may find this type of novel compelling, but from my perspective, the author of `Starship Troopers' and `The Puppet Masters' fell a long way when he published this novel.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long, a collection of witty saying interspersed throughout the book are great.  Judging from the other reviews, there are many who find this novel appealling.  Just be warned that this novel is very different than Heinlein's earlier classics.  There may be Time Enough for Love, but most people don't have enough time in their life to waste on this silliness 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 This is an earnest if clumsily written book about redemption and believing in yourself.  The dialogue is wooden and the characters are completely one dimensional.  The author is trying to make a statement about caring for the environment, but it just ends up to be preachy and pedantic.  There are far better young adult fantasy series on the market, and I would not recommend this one 
 I have numerous KA appliances, including the stand mixer and Food Processor.  I was happy to see a nice salad spinner, but was disappointed when I opened to use it for the first time.  The middle plunger which you are to turn counter clockwise to remove will not budge!  I tried, my husband tried and it is impossible to remove, therefore, I am unable to use the store feature since I cannot remove the plunger.  Something as simple as a salad spinner should not be so complicated 
 The Book of Nothing was much better. I am surprised at errors made on simple physical realities. Eclipse of sun is defined as earth's shadow covering sun's disc...  Sun's light reaching earth in 3 seconds... As one reviewer already mentioned, letter used for "1" is indistinguishable from "I"... I could not find much detail on "constants", just speculations and what if's... Quotes sprinkled all over are much more fun to read.. 
 really - with a name like simmons I thought it would be a good purchase - you sweat alot because its a layer of plastic - sounds like you are sleeping on garbage bags - i got a nicer one at target - plush cover without the NOIS 
 Jeremy Brett was by this time indeed "the dying detective," but  his real-life condition in no way helps this tedious and undramatic  rendition of one of Conan Doyle's more tasteless Holmes stories. The  original features some of Holmes' worst and most insensitive treatment of  poor Watson, but since this series made such a thing of their friendship,  the adapters have a heck of a time getting around it. Stick with the Brett  episodes from the mid-80s, when he was fresh in the role and the  adaptations were true and intelligent 
 While The Fear Book and The Depression Book might be amongst the best books in their class, they are still complete nonsense, which doesn't say much for this class of book. I regret wasting my money. I'd sell them on but I think people, particularly suffering people, need protection from this autho 
 Who wudda thunk it?  Chris Russo can read and write 
 We puchased three of them.  The first two "burned out" after about 45 min. the first time they were used.  The other one did the same the second time used. Would certainly not recommend it 
 The book is TEDIOUS. A few mediocre yarns and lots of detail about Irish horseracing last year and before. Lots of old, once-charming Irish cliches repeated and repeated. Too many names, too much trivial detail about weather, horses and people you don't need to know. I'm a horse owner and interested in racing. I was bored after 50 pages, but battled on for awhile. Maybe the ending is a corker, but I doubt it. Never got that far.  This would make a good 1,500-word magazine piece. Barich is a good writer, but this book is destined for the remainder table - and soon. It is a chore to read it. I think two stars is generous.   
 I bought Compton's book based on an ad in [...], a rather heavy duty marine diesel oriented web site. I already had Nigel Calder's marine diesel book and was somehow expecting more, but got less.  Calder's book is more detailed and thorough. If you have Calder's, then you don't need Compton's. So, my advice is to get Calder's marine diesel book instead 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 Beware of Spoilers: The story started good and went continually downhill. I don't need a happily ever after, but this ending was too much of a dramatic stretch and the Author seemed to enjoy to punish Jennifer Parker for falling in love with the wrong guy. Some plot points were utterly unbelievable, incl. killing off her son, taking away her friends, killing off her lover and Jennifer's true love Adam, who does nothing much than whining how he loves her, but sadly, his wife just got pregnant....same old, same old. I reckon the story is too outdated to be plausible any more. It was the first book I read from Sidney Sheldon and I am not going to read another novel from him. 
 Some small pearls but over all pieces are too short and over westernized 
 "As an African American gay man, Gomes is interested in re-viewing the biblical passages on sexuality and race" Without even picking up this book, you can see where it is going. The Bible clearly speaks out against the homosexual lifestyle? Strike those passages. The Bible is God's word and ought to read as such, not reinterpreted to make us feel better about our sin. By the way, being named one of the best seven preachers by TIME magazine is like being named one of the best seven Republicans by MoveOn.org, it doesn't hold much authority. Read a decent translation of the Bible for yourself and see what God has to say to you 
 This book starts of interesting however the book goes on and on and on about scenarios involving people over the phone,it rarely mentions person to person or online scams.  The book suggested solutions to preventing social engineering attacks is really poor,I enjoyed the book for a few days but its really same old all the way through,many of the stories read like Hack Philes you can find on the net,full of lies and waffle.  You will find your self bored of the book,there are plenty of copies of it on e-bay for a reason,buy it for sentiment only and because its black.  I can't believe its by Mitnic 
 I read this book in high school. I'd been told that Wicca was about celebrating the earth and nature. This book has spells for locker gnomes and a whole bunch of crazy stuff about those horrible, evil Christians. This book destroyed any interest I had in Wicca at the time. It wasn't until 5 years later when someone gave me a copy of Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner that I started learning about Wicca. Don't waste your money, time, or brain cells on this 
 Readers should be aware that this study was first published  in 1953, and despite light revision reflects the state of scholarship half a century ago.  We've learned a LOT about the history of Christianity since then, and many of the sweeping assumptions of this book (e.g., in the ghastly section entitled "The Darkest Hours: The Great Recession, A.D. 500-950") have been thoroughly discredited.  The bibliographies for each section don't include works published in the past half century (despite the so-called revision).  Even the very language is dated, with its grandiose, sweeping style, capitalization of popes, etc.  This book perpetuates a great many old myths, making the job of historians of religion just that much harder.  There are now much better books on the market 
 Although this edition was only published 2 years ago, the accomodation sections in various towns is already quite out of date .  I suppose the accomodation situation changes quite rapidly in Hungary, even the 2005 edition of LP Eastern Europe has much more up to date accomodation info for Hungary, altough as a whole it has less info on Hungary of course 
 The game is still fun, but many of the questions are so incredibly inane that no one would ever know them.  Who really knows who wrote the default ditty that plays when Microsoft Windows boots up?  The board is low quality and flimsy; it won't even lay flat on the table, so the dice don't stay on it well.  Another reviewer implied that only uneducated people would think the questions were too hard, but my husband and I are both finishing out master's degrees at Emory, and we both found the game boring and frustrating 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 I bought this cd because of songs listed which I've heard on satellite.  The songs on the cd are not what you hear on the radio- the versions on the cd are mundane and plodding at best- had I been able to listen first I would not have bought this albu 
 Was excited to receive the book, but a little dis-appointed after reading it.  The book is a quick history of a person starting training and the participatin in some triathlons. It was good to know the story, but not a book if you are looking for solid training tips or motivation 
 This is collection of grainy and VERY BIZZARE black and white photos. I've seen better results from a point and shoot. If your expecting one of those beautiful collections of an artisit's work, SURPRISE! The true value of this work is somewhere between disguarded photos and the ones hid under the bed of an andolescent. Thank you Amazon for your liberal return policy 
 This book is very poorly written and badly organized.  Essential introductory topics are sprinkled throughout the book seemingly randomly.  Much of the writing is horribly ambiguous or just plain unreadable.  I am a beginning programmer, though I am highly proficient with Excel.  I was lucky to be familiar with some other programming languages because the explanations of object-oriented programming concepts in this book (as well as other topics covered) would have been completely incomprehensible without a moderate level of background experience.  The examples in the book are neither practical, nor particularly well designed to illustrate the VBA concepts that the authors are trying to teach.  Instead, the authors seem to be preoccupied with designing examples to convey stylistic programming conventions that they personally favor.  
 The main reason that we bought this book was to find Irish names based on their meanings. Unfortunately, there are very few meanings of any of the names listed. If you are looking for an extensive list of Irish names but not interested in their meanings, then this is a good book for you. Otherwise I have come across many general name books that have much more complete lists of meanings along with the names 
 I think this would be better titled Thai Massage than Yoga Posture Adjustments and Assisting.  The assists are in the joints of the students and this is not recommended.   The balancing assists are an accident waiting to happen.  I really don't want to set myself up for liability if someone gets injured, most Yoga Insurance will not cover you if a student is injured from assisting and adjustments, they consider you are practicing chiropractic adjustments.  I don't regret buying the book; I might consider some of the assists on students that I know their physical concerns in a private yoga session 
 I happen to own the vinyl of "Eric Clapton" - The Delaney Bramlett mix (as it is now known). When I first bought the album,imagine my surprise to find all my friends' copies sounded totally different! I was thrilled to read it was FINALLY coming out on cd. I rush out to buy it, put on disc 2 and behold ----- IT'S NOT THE DELANEY BRAMLETT MIX!!!! I burned my album to cd some time ago, & you play them back to back --THEY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT RECORDS! My copy has a different mix, different vocal on "Bad Boy", a Leon Russell intro (singing & playing)on "Blues Power", and other intros. They didn't bother to listen to this cd before they made it, or I have the only copy that exists(I highly doubt it). The extras are ok, and the packaging is beautiful, but the representation of this as the Delaney Bramlett mix is fraudulent. I'm out $25.00,extremely dissappointed & mad. Next stop is to contact Polydor. 
 Except for two cuties: William Zabka and Dana Ashbrook! Especially Dana who constantly having a hard-on 
 Save your money!!  Not even worth buying used.   If a field guide is going to be uncommon then it should be full of heart.  Lacking this it should have basic info with at least a chuckle.  I was left feeling MS Lichen never left her car and read better descriptions of Chickadees from grandma's diaries.   Do not be conned by Linda Feltner's good field sketches and the sales package.  This book is bought for the illustrations only 
 This thing worked like a champ, impressed friends, and lasted all of 6 months...and then, the plastic screw that attaches the handle to the grating drum snapped.  Cheap, Cheap, Cheap! and at $20/per...definately not considered disposable!  Look elsewhere.  The Zyliss will be my next purchase and I will leave feedback. 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 I played my official soundtrack CDs to death so I was looking for a replacement.  This is not the real thing. A lot of the tracks aren't even on these, and the order on the rest of them is all mixed up.  Bad quality sound, without the energy and passion of the original -- sounds like elevator music.  There are even misspellings throughout the playlists.  It is not readily obvious to the buyer that it isn't what you think it is, until it arrives.    The Fellowship volume won't play on one of my hard drives at all; it plays, but fuzzily, on my laptop.  I gave up before trying it in the CD player in my vehicle.  
 Is this the best the right has to offer when it comes to humor?   No wonder the best comedians are always liberals 
 Readers interested in Benny Morris should read Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath's "War and Remembrance" in the summer 2002 issue of Azure. Porath adds to the Oct. 1995 and April 1990 discussions by Robert Satloff and Shabtai Teveth in Middle Eastern Studies and to Efraim Karsh's  excellent book, Fabricating Israeli History. Don't read this book without looking at these critiques.   Why? Morris et al tell readers they have written "new" history of Israel, considering the entire previous historical record as if it were solely propaganda for the Zionist cause. Here, Morris considers Jewish conduct in the 1947 and 1948, and why the Arabs fled.   Morris claims to be the first person to have looked at Israeli archives on the Dalet Plan, a plan to move populations in certain areas. Nevertheless, other scholars show that Morris and his peers in this book misrepresent themselves and the facts.   Firstly, Yigael Alon and Israel Galili, in The Book of the Palmah, gave Walid Khalidi material to argue in 1959 that the Dalet Plan was "the master plan of the Zionists" to expell Palestinians wholesale. Furthermore, the 1973 History of the Hagana (by Uri Millstein) included the entire Dalet Plan text. Official or not, these 1959 and 1973 Israeli Jewish histories, very shortly after the the 1948 war, did not hide what happened, as Morris claims here.  Morris also writes that Arab government archives were closed to his research and and to other historians writing on the Israeli-Arab conflict before him. He writes that he relied on Israeli and Western archives. But Porath, Karsh, Satloff and Teveth all show that this is not the case.   Furthermore, Morris did no research at the Hagannah archives or those of the IDF, a fact underlined by Efraim Karsh in 2002, and one which he admits in a more recent book (The War for Palestine). Morris now writes that in the mid 1980s both those archives were closed to all researchers after all. He writes, he was limited to few first-hand military materials, indicating that there is no "new" research here at all.   Morris' charge that Israel carried out a deliberate and systematic expulsion of the Palestinian Arabs isn't even remotely substantiated by extensive research done since the mid 1980s. On the contrary, Morris takes material very selectively, from Israeli archive fringes and makes what Porath terms "outrageoulsy false claims"-- that Israel's victory resulted from "an imperialist conspiracy or an overwhelming advantage in manpower and arms."   Indeed, Morris writes here that Arabs left Israel because of many factors, their departure was not the fault of the Jewish people alone. Then, he contradicts himself, giving those who hate Israel grounds to blame Israel for the exodus, without considering the other circumstances.   This book also details a so-called "massacre" in 1948 of Arabs at the village of Deir Yassin, but not enough to mention that the incident was actually a battle--in which most Arabs killed (like those in Jenin in March and April 2002) were armed.   Finally, Morris does not note (by comparison) other massacres in 1948--of Jews, by Arabs. On December 30, 1947, for example, Arabs murdered some 50 Jewish co-workers at the Haifa refinery. On April 13, 1948, they massacred over 80 Jewish doctors, nurses and Hebrew University workers on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.   Additionally, nearly all of the 131 people who surrendered at the Etzion Bloc were also murdered by Palestinian Arabs. Only two survived.  These latter Arab massacres of Jews do not fit the blame that Morris seeks to lay at Jewish feet. Nor does the fact that Jews did not afterwards flee, as occurred on the Arab side following the battle at Deir Yassin. So Morris omits them.   I also find it disturbing that the book nowhere mentions the equal refugee claim of 1 million Jewish refugees from 22 Arab nations, who were expelled with nothing but the shirts on their backs, and rebuilt their lives in Israel, the U.S., and Europe.   The number of Jewish refugees was actually larger than that of Arab refugees (counting only those who fled, not their descendants). Honest history would have noted these parallels as well as the entire context of the war.   --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 Points for the concept, but this CD kept me awake!  The crashing waves are loud and distracting, even on low volume, and the music frankly a little depressing.  I actually found myself getting agitated listening to it.  Then again, I had some of the worst nights' sleep ever during a vacation in Belize in which I camped on the beach for a week.  Oddly enough, Gibson's Ocean Sounds works better for me, probably because there the waves are gently washing up on shore rather than smacking into rocks.  If you are used to ocean sounds then Natural Sleep Inducement may work for you, but if you're landlocked like me you may not find it as helpful 
 Have to have it and use it to write a review, Don't you think; Sorr 
 The book provides believable and sometimes fascinating information, and the author is to be commended for getting this hard-sell published. But the writing is stilted and surprisingly flat considering the writer is a professional music journalist with a growing list of book credits.   If the reader is looking for evangelical fervor - and a writing style that can inspire - they will not find it here.   As is always advisable to those who do seek to turn someone on to music - give that person the music of Big Star. Don't give them this book. 
  Ok let me break itdown for you. The Game isn't all thatb great, infact it sucks on ice, but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year. Really you really can't blame them that made this game. The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years. there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great. we see about 90% of games and movies arent doing that good. so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out. I Promise you that year want disoponte. So dont buy every thing in 06, wait till 07. Dont waiste your mone 
 This is the second HD DVD that I've had issues with the XBox360 player, the other being Children of Men. Ironically, both are dual format. While Children of Men refused to play, this one refuses to go past chapter 12. I've had no issues with my PS3 playing any of the Blu-Ray movies so it begs the question, what is wrong with this format? I've got another dual format HD DVD/DVD disk that I'm going to try. Anyhoo, if you're using the XBox360 HD DVD player, this movie might not play all the way for you or might not even play at all 
 I bought the book thinking it would be a practical introduction on how to apply CMMI to your company hence I was very disappointed to find out the authors have limited themselves only to summarize the CMMI models. Few real explication is given about concepts within the CMMI models, neither any real life experience is shared that could help you implement CMMI 
   Might be good for someone who likes romance novels with literary asprirations.   A reminder not to buy 5 star books with less than 10 reviews 
 This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure 
 The book seems to ramble back and forth in time and little is tied down. People are listed (Calabi & Yao - Yang & Mills and so on) But I have no idea of what they really added to SMT. No equations are given. It theories failed, IO have no idea why 
 I was in an airport looking for something to read. The selection was thin. Basically there was the NYT best seller rack and Dr. Phil. I generally like political thrillers and Brad Thor's Blowback seemed promising. I never read Thor, or even really know much if anything about him and his work. The book is "ripped from the headlines" which is another way of saying if it's paperback, the plot points are probably dated.   The book was enough to keep my attention from the in-flight Jennifer Anniston movie. After the trip, I found it hard to find the motivation to pick it up and finish it. The hard-boiled military hero is nothing new nor real original. The main antagonist is a cut-throat Democrat Senator "who will stop at nothing" to take down the President. The character is named Helen Remington Carmichael, and the initials aren't the only comparison to a certain New York senator. The effort to frame the character as Clinton is so transparent, it would be ridiculous by itself if the character wasn't ridiculously cartoon-like in partisanship. Needing to demonize a sitting senator in order to make an effective protagonist doesn't say much about Thor's imagination or character development. After a few chapters the wink and nod partisan commentary got old. If you have Ann Coulter on your bookshelf, you may get a few chuckles as Thor gleefully tries in indoctrinate readers, but others who don't share the neo-con ideology will likely find many distractions 
 Oh the HUMANITY!...   First, the obvious: Tara Reid as Cybill? I don't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor, but it is a mystery how that happened.   Secondly, Dominique Swain just didn't act like the Andrea Marr of the book. It seemed like Dominique Swain didn't even read the book before she played Andrea. I also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around, but that's another topic.   The movie didn't have any similarities with the "feeling" of the book, even though the plot was (roughly) similar.   Portia DeRossi as Carla? Ummmm.... maybe?   Selma Blair as Darcy sort of worked.   The only character I felt was well-cast was Todd Sparrow.   Anyhow, I re-read the book a few more times since seeing the movie, to try to recapture the feel of the book (and erase the memory of the movie) 
 I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.  If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.  If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot 
 My 3 boys (ages 4, 7 and 9) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up.  Imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it.  We have 3 of them (Darth Vader, Obi-wan and Luke Skywalker). Vader was done before 9am Christmas morning. The other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be "very gentle" when they load the saber. The worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now.  These are not rough kids and it's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed.  Stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action.  
 So, poor Brooke Shields felt unhappy? So what? Is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty, who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation? Is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year? And all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself. Of all the times in one's life, the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby, yet still she couldn't feel her own baby's love for her. How pathetic. I think she'd have soon changed her tune had she been marooned on a desert island after a plane crash, and she realised she could die any moment. People get 'depressed' because they spend too much time thinking, and thinking about THEMSELVES. Don't these pathetic people have anything better to do with their lives? Think of all the suffering she could prevent if she used her fame and money to do so.  She should read "Stop thinking and start living" 
 I borrowed this book from the library, as I have been very hesitant to spend the money on Cat Who books lately.  This one has set the seal on it, though...I don't even want to read them any more.  Even Koko and Yum Yum have been made totally uninteresting.  This is a series which should have retired on a positive note because so many people enjoyed it.  Instead, the publisher has run it into the ground through sheer incompetence.  I hope there is some poor lowly soul at Putnam whose job it is to read customer feedback and pass it on to the fools in charge...maybe they will finally let this series rest in piece 
 Ignoring the normal quibbles anyone would have with anthologies' selections is easy when you check out Payne and Hunter's volume--or, rather, try to check it out. Like others in the Blackwell series, _Renaissance Literature_ is rendered useless by its size print: far too small to be seen comfortably for even a moment, far FAR too small if you'd like to read, say, _The Faerie Queen_. Not recommended, not recommendable 
 Guenter Lewy seems to have one mission in life: to prove that there was only one genocide in world history, that of the Jewish people during WWII, and that no other ethnic or religious groups have ever been victims of genocide. In recent years, he has been publishing one book after another that attempt to demonstrate that various peoples (American Indians, Gypsies, Armenians) were never victims of genocide. To achieve his objective, he makes a selective use of historical documents, using only the ones that corroborate his thesis, and ignoring those that would prove him wrong. His reading of history is permeated with bias. I recommend anyone to read the negative review of this book by a world-class scholar of genocide, Robert Melson, in Holocaust and Genocide Studies (vol. 16, no. 1, 2002). 
 First of all let me say that I am a serious reader.  I purchase books before I even read what I've already purchased.  Anyhow, I'm tired of supporting books marketed to African Americans, yet not being appreciated.  Time and time again the books are riddled with errors and this is so unacceptable.  You don't find this problem with other books.  It's like their saying so what they are going to buy the books anyway.  I'm really getting tired of being taken advantage of.   Anyhow, I found this book to be unrealistic.  This girl goes from being a young virgin to a professional whore in one breath.  No street knowledge to a gansta girl tricking men for money.  Just too unrealistic.  The book was also kind of a slow read but picked up towards the end.  The book was okay, however, not one of the best or one that I would really recommend 
 I bought this as a gift for my nephew. Unfortunately it didn't work when it arrived, but fortunately my sister in law was able to take it to a local discovery store and exchange it for one that worked fine 
 Shame on Keith Whitelam.  He's a trained scholar who ought to know better than to perpetrate something like this.  We readers do not deserve this substitution of crude political propaganda for something of academic value 
 The only reason to read this book is if you're really bored, because it has nothing new to offer at all. While the writer is satisfactory, all the story does is rehash the past. Nothing important happens. So, its basically as though the author has turned an episode transcript into a narrative. For someone who's been obsessed with btvs, especially Spike, for a long time--it was a real disapointment. It's basically a kids book and Buffy was never really a kids show 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 The authors make the dumb mistake of assuming that because the shroud dates from the Middle Ages it must be a fake.  It's true connection with Jacques de Molay is not explored fully.  They haven't seen the true connection between Jaques de Molay and Leonardo Da Vinci, but at least they were on the right track here.  Miracles do happen and none of their arguments have convinced me for one instant that the Turin Shroud is a fake.  The shroud was used to wrap the body of Jaques de Molay, but the image is most likely of Jesus Christ.  It's that simple.  Can I prove this - No.  Can anyone disprove this - Give it a go.  This book was a rather lame-brained attempt 
 I can't even believe alkaline trio even let that be put on a cd, that is terrible 
 The most painfully slow book I've read in years.  I don't think he made it out of first gear until about 3/4 the way through the book. With difficulty he finally shifted into second gear and by the end of the book was cruising at a not-so-exhilarating 30 miles an hour.  The medical and scientific details are accurate and fairly well-written.  The major subplots are "what's for dinner tonight," and "what will the plumber work on next."  The dialogue is artificial and irritating.  It reminds me of a dialogue from one of my third-grader's stories.  Using words like "modicum" and "greasy spoon" I wonder if Mr. Cook could possibly have been born in the same century as the rest of us.  I want my $7.00 back 
 It took me over two months to finish this book. Obviously some serious research went into the perfume making part, but otherwise much of the historical and geographical detail is wrong. This would be nothing if it were a compelling read. It is not. The protagonist, Grenouille, is empty. I did not like him, love him, hate him, admire him, despise him, fear him. Quite an achievement for a serial killer. I did not feel sorry for his victims either.  In fact, I did not feel anything for any of the characters. But maybe that was the author's point 
 I'm sorry to those who apparently loved this book, but I didn't! I thought it was awful how he strung sentences together, using commas, so that 7  sentences would become 1, making a paragraph!  He was not a good author,  and I definitly didn't need to hear about "The Time In the Life Of A  Hormonally Charged Boy"!  All in all it was a complete waste of time,  so don't read it! = 
   I bought this book as a gift for my spouse. Notice I said "spouse". Sex is made to be enjoyed within the bond of marriage, I do not condemn any sex enjoyed within that loving relationship. It is a pure and holy union instituted by God.    My biggest problem with this book is something that none of the other reviewers really mentioned. Not only does the author include a couple stories and references to her and her friends' lovers, but she inundates the reader with idolatry. This author's beliefs revolve around "gods and goddesses". She constantly talks about sex altars, statues of gods and goddesses, icons and pagan history. She makes statements about penis worship, ceremonies and invoking the spirit of gods and goddesses. This is sick and twisted, it cetainly is not what I had hoped for. There may be some okay ideas in here, but there are plenty of other books that do not lead us down the wrong road just because we are interested in achieving better physical intimacy with our husbands or wives.    The other part is that the author assumes that the reader enjoys reading curses. Why should people relate loving sex with idol worship and immorality?    This book takes a great thing, sex, and twists it into something that many people will not want to read about. If you are looking for a good book about this subject, I recommend looking elsewhere. Hopefully, this review has helped you make that choice. 
 I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days.  The bag, on the other had, leaves a bit to be desired.  While the material used is soft, the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand 
 I purchased Relacore to give myself a boost in my wieght loss. I am exercising very regularly. Nearly everyday and had hit a wall in my wieght loss. Relacore PM did not help me lose any wieght and I certainly didn't sleep any better. Matter of fact I seemed to have more difficulty drifting off to sleep during the 3+ weeks I used it 
 Top does not heat up enough to sear what you put into the pan. Also, it's very, very hard to clean. I am really disappointed by this product 
 Given the talent involved, I have always been surprised and disapointed at how bad this studio recording is.  Kanawa is even occasionally off-pitch, and she and Carreras show little of the verve and beauty that made them  international stars.  I'd look elsewhere for a recording of this wonderful  score 
 I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.  Six weeks later (November 27th) I received a properly functioning gauge.  So it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  There was just a very large run of defective ones.  At this point, I would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.  If yours is defective, you should contact Accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240.  
 Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one 
 I really had a problem with this book.  This is my first encounter with Feist's work, and I'm finding it difficult to give him a second chance.  From reading other reviews, it seems that people who have read previous works by Feist derive some enjoyment from the world this book is written in, as well as the presence of some familiar characters.  Since I lacked this prior knowledge about Midkemia and its inhabitants, I was left to judge the book purely for the quality of the fiction, and I found it to be uninspiring.    Talon is an incredibly shallow character.  His thoughts and actions are polarized and always single faceted.  If at any time during a book you can describe the complete emotional state of the main character in one word, the author is probably doing something wrong.  While this is bad, it is not disastrous; except when you consider that Feist conveys Talon's emotions to us in a totally uninteresting way.  I believe the addage is, "show, don't tell."  It didn't seem like any of Talon's emotions were real because they were conveyed in such a mind-numbing manner.  It seemed to me that Talon was forced along by the plot rather than guided by his emotions.  Furthermore, Talon's transformation from mountain boy to noble swordsman extraordinaire was unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous.  How Feist can expect us to swallow this garbage while he skips over years of Talon's training and culturing is truly remarkable.  I do not have a problem with Feist's plot idea of turning a country bumpkin into a hero (it is a hallmark fantasy plot), but you have to make the reader believe it.  A few chapters of magic school, snippets of verbal training, and a few sword bouts are not enough to raise this character to the level that Feist has raised him.    Other characters in this book were similarly shallow.  I really saw no difference between any of Talon's trainers except their professions.  You could literally exchange the dialogue between Caleb and Robert, or Caleb and Magnus, or any other similar pair, and you would not notice the difference.  They all spoke exactly the same way, and taught similar lessons.  The battle sequences were dull, ambiguous, and failed to excite me.  The language Feist used was simple and boring more often than not.  Do yourself a favor and read George R.R. Martin's or Terry Goodkind's series instead of this one.    
 This book was painfully bad.  If you are tempted to buy it, I strongly suggest reading an excerpt from it, or flipping through a few pages at the library or a bookstore.  It's pretentious prose, with thin characters and a plot with very little to recommend it.  Interested in the Hoover Dam?  He gets to it about two hundred pages in.  If gratuitous violence is your thing, you might be able to skim this novel for the parts about Lew Beck and enjoy the bits where he stomps on legless beggers, chops off fingers, or stabs people in the guts with broken bottles.  I wouldn't have minded the violence so much had the justification for it not been so very weak.  Nothing we see of Lew's childhood really illuminates his sadistic nature to my satisfaction. He just doesn't add up, which is frustrating because he's the only potentially interesting thing in novel.  
 This is probably one of the worst books ever published. 1st of all,it is trying to be allegorical when it really isn't. Kafka is great allegory. Innocence is not. Her ramblings read like bad confessional poems- like Sharon Olds- she had every cliche- being trapped underwater, blood, melodrama, etc... The ironic thing is that this book is SO bad you won't forget it. So I do recommend it so people can see how bad it really is. The sad thing is that there was a review written by a young girl who liked this crap & said how it has "inspired" her to be a writer. Sheesh. This is why bad writing does us no good. This book is easy to write and easy to read, and it gives hopefuls who can't see Jane's lack of talent hope, just as Sharon Olds gives bad women poets hope. UGH 
 My infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds.  It is not a well designed blanket 
 Great movie, excellent acting!  Annette Benning is priceless as the love interest in this film about a widower in the White House.  He seeks a relationaship with an environmental lobbyist, of all things, and though their relationship is open and above board, the politicians use it against the incumbent during his run for reelection.  Politics are ugly, but truth prevails in this optimistic movie.  My husband and I love this one and we have watched it many times.  We always love the ending because we enjoy love winning and truth being stronger than bad politics.  Easily one of my favorites.  
 Let me start by stating that im a 24 year old university educated individual.  This book was thrusted into my face and forced into my brain when i was in forth grade.  It was by far the most driest and boring book i've ever read at that point in my life...and continue to be so until college.  Now, i dont remember anything at all about this book other than the fact it was about some boy writing letters to some man; but the fact that i dont remember anything gives you an idea at how little i stimulted.  Till this day, im reluctant to even bother to re-read this book and give it another chance.  I've been scarred for life.  I have no doubt that this books contains a lot of substance and insightful tales, but the thought of reading some poor pathetic boy's letters causes me to shriver.  If i would have to chose any book of my childhood that discouraged me from reading more, it would have to be this.  PLease spare your child/student from the tortures of this book.  Maybe once they've grown mentally and have the capacity and patience to understand it, it would be a great book.  But at such a young age, its a horrible read.  I noticed that this book recieved some high marks from young readers; for some reason i feel that those ratings may be incorrect and the young children's opinions may have been "clouded".  Do you teacher's know no shame?  
 I was expecting (er, hoping for) something closer to "Hounds of Love," but this was spacey and unspooled. I appreciate change and I appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting, but this was a bit much for me. Some songs seem to just spin off into nothingness, others drag on and on. A few songs have much triter lyrics than I expected from her, and on most her voice seems to be rambling while disregarding the music behind it. I liked one or two tracks, but overall I cannot get into this 
 I was very disappointed with Feed Your Kids Well. This is an Atkins/Low Carbohydrate type diet that excludes most fruits and vegetables. The book is filled with list of "off limit" foods and only 6-7 time consuming recepies. All meals must be made from scratch and everyday  children should be eating eggs for breakfas! What if your child does not  like eggs?  The author is unclear on what children should be eating. His  suggestions seem unrealistic (especiall for working parents) and his  exclusion of most fruits and vegetables seems more of a "fad  diet" than a healty solution to a difficult problem many parents with  little time face 
 When I was a university student 14 years ago, I followed this book to the letter - 3 days in the gym every week for six months and then a split system which got me in the gym 4 days a week for another year or so.   In hindsight, it worked (as any beginner gets a little bigger anyway just by heading to the gym) but I picked up a copy of BRAWN a year later - training twice a week just focussing on the big exercises and realised far better results.    This book is good for motivation, a trip down memory lane for some; it has some good ideas but generally the routines aren't suitable for anyone training without steroids.  I wonder why Joe Weider never discussed the issue when obviously so many, if not all contributors, depended on steriods to realize their success...  
 When I first purchased these towels I was very happy.  They were soft and luxurious.  After a couple of months of use, I am very sorry I ever purchased them.  While they are still thick, they have lost any softness they had.  They are now great for exfoliating.  Also, here's the strange part, the decorative border of the towels has shrunk 11 full inches in width. The towels are now ruffled on the ends. (Yes, I did follow the instructions on the care label.)They were a terrible waste of money. If you would like to purchase a truly luxurious towel, try Charisma Egyptian cotton towels.  I have owned these in the past, and will be what I replace the ruffled sanding towels with.  They are worth the extra few dollars 
 I was thoroughly disappointed while reading Lord of Silent, as the overall action and suspense was kept almost at a minimum.   It seems almost as if Peters went on a long tangent about the Emerson's family life, writing a lot of filler to go along with the main plot. Until the last forty pages or so, I struggled to get through the book because there was no suspense at all. No cliff-hangers or anything of the sort.  Ramses and Nefret, though darling, only thickened the struggle. I don't think that all the interaction between them was really necessary; perhaps Peters wanted to throw in some romance, but is wasn't working.  Lord of the Silent is a sheer failure of Peters's story-telling skills, as in many of her other books her talent proves to be quite brilliant. Save your money and buy a different Peters's book 
 hey!  this is a set of Cloud:Stallion of the Rockies and some of the important members of his family. Cloud is a very pale yellowish dun, and Sitka, his mare, is a beautiful blue roan witha a black mane and tail.  Boulder, the light palimino colt is a adorable with a white main and tail. Flint is the grulla colt with stripes on the front legs and a black dorsal stripe. This is an excellent play set, and I would defenitely recomend it for a gift 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 If you think your getting the Super Bowls, you're not. It's a glorified season in review and and 20 minutes of each "Super Bowl" is dedicated to the actual SB. This is nothing more than the stuff they show on the off season when there is nothing else to keep the NFL fans fed. I'm going to try and return this, but I'm sure it won't happen.. 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 I bought this movie after reading the rave reviews on this site.  I have to say I was highly disappointed.  Although the 2 main characters are very likeable and their acting is good, the disco-type music in this so-called scary movie was just annoying.  I also found the 'love-scene type' music very inappropriate.  The type of music they used just made me hate the movie even more.  I was hoping for a 'haunted house' theme in this movie and it just didn't deliver.  I will give this movie 2 stars because I liked the 2 main characters.  There are no gruesome murders or anything like that in this film 
 I was hoping this book would provide insights into how to present complex information in a more comprehensible, useful format, using PowerPoint as the tool. Instead, the overall gist of this book is that presentations should be "dumbed down" as much as possible. The theme the author presents is that presentations should be story based. This is reasonable. However, the method the author recommends is that essentially *all* meaningful, complex (or, as the author prefers "boring") content be removed from the presentation. Presentations then become nothing more than catchy headlines and colorful graphics. All content should be in the presenter's notes (not typically to be provided). This is juvenile and useless and frankly reflects a complete lack of understanding of how presentations are made in a complex business environment. 
 Without going on too much, these stories are fragmented, unclear, poorly written, and the plots are lame and basically make no sense.  I wrote a more in depth reveiw for "Edward's Exploit", which we bought along with this one.  While some other (but most definitely not all) Thomas books revolve around a core group of charaters and seem to teach lessons and have some excitement to them, this book has a new character speaking less and less sense on every page.  My toddler can't get into these.   My two year old will read "Trouble for Thomas", "A Cow on the Line" and "Thomas gets Tricked" over and over and over, but he lost interest in this collection of stories before we had even read it once.  It wouldn't have been too hard for me to have read one story before buying this, but since the other Thomas books we had we such hits I figured I didn't need to . . . BIG mistake!  
 This pitter is a nice looking stainless steel pitter. If you don't mind wasting your money, this pitter is for you. After pitting a pound of cherries, effortlessly, the pitter's pin stopper broke....which meant the cherries had to be pulled off of the pin, slowing pitting. It was, pardon the pun, the pits 
 I enjoyed the parts regarding the S.S. Valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. Except for Picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. We never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. The whole "adversarial" situation with the 1st Officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for Picard 
 There's some useful information but it's extremely difficult to find through all the pointless little quizzes and stories about how awesome the author is at reading people 
 I'm sorry I wasted the afternoon reading it....was about the worst thing I have ever read in its category.  Would have liked to rate it as NO stars but that is not an option.  Just happened to read it because it has been sitting here for 4 years since my mom died and I took i 
 I have read hundreds of true crime books and I followed the story of Lori Hacking in the news very closely.  So when I was on vacation and was looking for a book to read on the airplane, I was happy to see that a book had been written about Lori's story.  I am now very disappointed that I did not have the benefit of Amazon's customer reviews before wasting my money on this book.  The author did not talk to any family members (save maybe Paul, who had one or two quotes in the entire book).  The book was written from a reporter's perspective and added no detail that I had not already read in news reports when the story was unfolding several years ago.  He even quoted the National Enquirer.  Here are some quotes from this book:  "While Winslow had his scoop, and would lead others to the story, the Deseret Morning News held an edge.  The paper, which had been founded by Brigham Young, would make the playing field uneven for other news outlets working the story.  Throughout coverage of the case, journalists from the Deseret Morning News got access to family members of Lori and Mark Hacking when other news outlets did not.  Why should journalists from the old Deseret News and Church-owned KSL get all the leads?" (p. 108)  "The AP reporter hadn't paid much attention to the missing persons story out of City Creek Canyon when it first broke.  After all, it was local and would be of only passing interest to the wire service clients who subscribed at radio and television stations and newspapers across Utah, much less the ones on the national wire.  But word travels fast among AP clients, and the wire service's Utah office learned that the North Carolina television station had broken a major story on the Hacking disappearance.  The AP reporter was now assigned full time to the story as the AP moved the item." (p. 133).  "Network television producers and guest bookers have a power that print journalists envy.  The lure of the camera, the desire to appear on national television, boils under the surface of a surprising number of ordinary citizens. . . .  But three outlets had an edge, and they covered both print and electronic news.  The Church-owned Deseret Morning News and KSL radio and television often managed to beat the competition, both in print and on the air." (p. 143-144).  "The editorial showed how out of touch the hierarchy of The Salt Lake Tribune had become in its ignorance of how major media work.  Worse, it demonstrated a shallow view fired by a desire of city fathers to manipulate the image of the city.  Members of the national media laughed when they read it and e-mailed it to their home offices, who laughed as well." (p. 149)  "Money is a lawyer's curse and blessing.  The curse is simple:  If there is a Hell, surely some of them will find their particular circle to roast on for defending their clients who paid them.  The blessing is equally simple:  They will live well, eat well, drink well, and have the most articulate friends around until that day comes and they face the Devil himself." (p. 153).  Anyone who writes true crime books should realize that the American system of justice includes the Constitutional right to an attorney for all accused of a felony, and to compare a defense attorney to the Devil for doing his or her job is ridiculous coming from a true-crime author.  The portion of the book describing the weeks when the police were digging through the landfill was torturous:  Page 172: "Tedium quickly became the norm, yet once in a while the search would stop as cops would walk over to look in the pit that had been dug.  When that happened, reporters scrambled, knowing only that the cops had broken the routine and were doing something different.  Maybe that meant they had found something.  The journalists sitting along the road joked among themselves that they were stationed in a media version of summer camp, although a smelly one.  Some brought lawn chairs, chips, cookies, and sodas."  For crying out loud.  It was at this part of the book that I began rolling my eyes on a regular basis at the absurdity of this story and the wonder that any publisher would accept it.  I try not to criticize a book without reading the entire thing, and because I was trapped on an airplane with nothing else to do, I finished this one.  It never got any better.  I cannot say that a news reporter would not find this book interesting, but I can certainly say that no one else will.  The story of Lori Hacking broke my heart.  I only hope that a really good author (Jerry Bledsoe, Carlton Stowers, Ann Rule, Charles Bosworth) will do us all a favor and tell Lori's story the way it should be told.  I would recommend to anyone "A Killer Among Us" by Charles Bosworth, Jr. -- a story about a husband who hired someone to kill his 28-year-old wife and the mother of his 4 children, Elizabeth DeCaro.  That book will make you cry, and you will feel the pain of each family member because Bosworth brings you inside each person's heart.  Elizabeth's memory was done justice by Bosworth, and I only hope that someday we can say the same for Lori 
 I recall the time, as I worked on a large parallel Unix debugger, and only slowly collected facts and scraps of necessary knowledge to progress. I always wondered, why not a single book was written, which would be solely devoted to the architecture, design and implementation of symbolic debuggers?  As I saw this book announced, my expectations were high. Could this be a help in organizing my knowledge about debuggers, collected so far from semi confidential industry reports or white papers, 3-4 dissertations, several implementations, plus some 10-15 conference papers with vague descriptions of implementations, claims of spectacular achievements or with mere theoretical ideas?  No, unfortunately this is not so. This book, or rather "a booklet" is very incomplete. It literally did not told me any single detail which I would not have known already. For example, missing is the description of the very standard Unix interface to control and hold a process. Since this is not a scientific book providing more generic foundations about process tracing (such as tracking of very long time running programs, replay techniques, generating snapshots etc. etc.) than I would at least expect a solid practice orientation. This should include a complete discussion of several assemblers and typical architectures, because they provide sometimes completely different means of implementing breakpoints, watchpoints or of support for threads. In many cases a debugger must be, or can be supported by a cooperating compiler. Several interesting ideas have been implemented in the back ends, which may greatly help supporting breakpoints, finding function prologues, dealing with exceptions and asynchronous signals. I also miss the specifications and a good comparison of the two most common formats holding symbolic information, Stabs and DWARF!  Etc. etc., this list of missing facts and issues could go on and on.  Usually I call a book like this one "a blah blah novel." The author claims "I know something, but I will not tell what is it." Yes, there are debuggers, yes we can program them but a lot of code is necessary to do so, yes we can stop a process and advance it instruction by instruction. Yes, yes, I know all that.  I think that will have to keep waiting for a serious book about symbolic debugging! Any takers? If I only could write well.. 
 I was very excited when I came across this book.  I am both a Christian AND a Star Wars nut.  I began reading this book right away, and it started slow.  I kept reading, hoping it would really dive into some good contrast.  It never came.  I'm sure this guy meant well, but he had a very shallow knowledge of the Star Wars films, and on the Christian side, everything felt like it was from a 5th grade Sunday school class.  I want so badly for this book to be great, but it is not.   I wish I would have written it 
 As a professional classical muscian I strongly urge folks NOT to purchase this unfortunate recording.  I can't believe the positive reviews on this CD.  The musicians sound very amature, out of tune, rhythmically dull, boring & uninspired, not together; I would characterize the playing as "cruddy", to be polite. but often non-musicians don't notice or care about things like this, ...so if you are a freaked-out bridal party with no other ideas at the last minute, a tin ear and no musical sense at all, then by all means buy this C 
 I don't know what everyone loves about this book?! Yeah, I thought the title was funny, but boy was I wrong about its contents! As an expectant father who has read quite a few books meant specifically for fathers, I was expecting a bit more from this one. What I came to find out was that unfortunately, the title of this book is its only redeeming feature.  This book is neither informational nor funny. Its brevity in actually providing useful information was appalling. Do they think we are Neanderthals who aren't interested in having a positive and interactive child birth experience with our wives? Beyond this, the book is completely chauvinistic towards women in every way possible. It does not teach men to enjoy and learn with their partners during the pregnancy, it tells them how to "deal" with their hormonal wives and ways to avoid getting themselves involved.  After reading this book, I was actually offended to think that anyone would consider men in this light. As a man who is interested in his wife and in learning about his yet unborn child, this all too common outlook about men and pregnancy is exactly what we do not need on our bookshelves.  Forget this book altogether and check out one that will actually be funny, informative, and teach you a thing or two! My favorite book is one in the series by Armin Brott. He is a great writer with lots of great resources and insight into what it is to be an expecting father. Try starting with The Expectant Father: Facts, Tips and Advice for Dads-To-Be. You will not be disappointed 
 I was given this book and I dedicated a whole day reading it to see if there was something memorable about this story, but NO there's nothing good about this awful book. The characters are flat, no depth or character development, the story lacked passion and it has an undefined plot... This is the worst book I have read so far this year. I swear I never throw books away but this time, I tore it apart and threw it away as the worst trash ever.  Imagine this 6th rate soap opera, the main character's mother left her and her father behind when she finds out that her husband's real love of his life was her own mother, that would be the main character's grandmother...  No taste whatsoever and simply it's impossible to recommend. Don't get this book, you'll just feel cheated with it's trashy story and characters full of voids. 
 This is the most disappointing album I have ever purchased. The first two albums were characterized by upbeat, voluminous guitar distortion which fueled the soul.  Unfortunately, in most of the songs on this album, the guitars took a back seat to subpar vocals.  Gone are the beautiful and intricate sounds and high production quality.    This album is clearly about trying to "rebrand" Sanctus Real to appeal to a larger CCM listener base.  But unfortunately, this has alienated me and no doubt countless other fans.  I just can't see how one can love the earliers albums along with the current one.  Aside from "I'm not alright" and perhaps if I stretch "Trying" this album did not live up to expectations 
 Don't know what it is about this book, but it just didn't do anything for me. The plot is original and intriguing, but something just didn't work for me. It wasn't the characters, some of whom were likeable. It wasn't the villians, whom were quite cool--who doesn't like aliens, giant scorpion/crab/spider monsters, and derranged ape-people? I think it was the books predictability that made it a tedious read. Lumley never truly generates any real suspense or a sense of urgency, so as creative as some of the foes are, they're not terrible effective. I understand there is a sequel. Maybe I'll read that some day. If you're really into sci-fi, give it a read. It just didn't click for me. Real rating: 2-and-a-half stars 
 I thought this would be a great buy, but the shipping costs make it more expensive than best buy.  Screw that 
 A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?). The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: "paper or plastic?&quot 
 As a JD PhD who teaches and researches American slavery I can say two horrendous things about this work. First, it is considered a classic and required reading for anyone who wants to understand the institution of slavery in America. Second, it is condescending, racist and continues to contaminate otherwise intelligent thought on the topic. Genovese contends that slave control was maintained through Hegemony, a concept developed by Gramsci to explain how the ruling class under capitalism uses ideology to persuade workers to consent its own moral, political and cultural values to their own detriment, a concept that can have no meaning in a regime of physical coersion. Genovese also claims that slavery was paternalistic, where slaves and their owners had reciprical rights and obligations. For example, according to him, slaves would "consent" to whippings that they saw as "reasonable." If you want a nice, pastoral portrayal of slaves singing while they cut "massa's" cotton, well this is the book for you 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 i loved the ideas presented in this book, and i do read alot of books about the media, modern technologies, and their effect on our lives and on the society.  although the presented ideas are great, the style of the writing gets to me every time.  absolutely terrible.  im not sure if the author was trying to exemplify the mass confusions, lack of attention span of today's society through the litteral writing, but it detracts from the points that he makes.  many examples are presented have no form of organization whatsoever, and many arent even necessary.  zengotita could have conveyed the message of the book in half the length and it would have been more effective than this book will ever be 
 Garbage. We have 6 smoke alarms in our house. Two of them are First Alert. This one, and another model. The ONLY ones that repeatedly false alarm are the First Alert. This one is the WORST. Randomly, for ZERO reason, it goes off. Usually in the middle of the night. Called Customer Service and they tried to tell us it was because it was near a bathroom with humidity. Yea, right. Moved it downstairs, near NO bathrooms or kitchens and it STILL falses.  GARBAG 
 Why do authors persist in writing about heroes no hot blooded woman would give the time of day? I was totally disappointed in this book...and have come to the conclusion that Coulter's historicals are a risky buy. I mean, 75% of the time I am disappointed! I am going to stick to her contemporaries...where I at least know the heroine will not allow herself to be treated that way. Sheesh! This book was horrible 
 I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut 
 I found this to be an excellent resource for anyone understanding that our job as the church is to reach people with the Good News but our guests won't hear our message until they know how much we value them. We demonstrate that through our 'Customer Service' and creating a WOW experience that will bring them back and eventually engage them in service. This is a very practical approach in how to demonstrate the value we have for those people God brings through our doors.   
 Not much there,some good ideas but really only a few chapters worth of materia 
 This book has a fairly annoying layout which refers back to information not previously mentioned.  The examples are also fairly overly complex, there are much simpler ways to solving the problems.  Regardless, it was a required book 
 Buy this book and you will lose your maney, check it from a library and you will lose your time. The book is OK for undergraduates, but if you really want to learn anything about institutional sociology, chech out the  works of Oliver Williamson, James March, or Michael Hannan 
 This book is horrible - not at all funny.  Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 This item came on time but the sizing are wrong.I normally wear medium and I bought large thinking the cheap price would affect sizing. I was right. Had to give them away,could not wear them.They were so tight and the fabric so light I could not think of wearing the 
 This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion.  If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it 
 The hardcover and the e-book version should not be linked together because the e-book version is only 12 pages! Complete waste of money, I wish I could return it. I made the mistake of reading the review of the hardcover version (which is shown on this page too), and since I had already read the original book, I though I was making a bargain. The joke is on me... :- 
 This book is so generic in its advice that it is all but useless. It tries to be all things to all cameras, and therefore says nothing specific about anything. Add to this the way it tries to tout Kodak film, and you realize Kodak should be paying people to read this book. But they still wouldn't know how to work their cameras 
 I've seen many reviewers argue that the use of DDT to prevent malaria deaths in the developing world is unjustified because 1) it may cause greater long-term harm to the environment, and 2) mosquitoes will eventually develop resistance to the insecticide.  One San Francisco reviewer even claimed "We have no idea of how many millions, or billions, of people globally have been impacted by its use in the forms of debilitating illnesses and death from cancer and the like." According to her, it's irresponsible to use DDT when we have no idea to what extent the negative impact, if any (although "billions of people" is a bit ridiculous), is of using it.  But there's no question what the negative impact has been of banning it: millions and millions of preventable deaths. So some environmentalists are apparently more than happy to allow an absolute--millions dead--in exchange for an unknown.  Part of the reason why it's so easy for them to trade lives for theory is that they don't give much day to day thought about malaria. It's a disease that doesn't worry people in the developed world. It happens "over there" in the third world, and if we actually get it over here, well, no worries--we get treated and fully cured with relatively affordable drugs. Who in the West actually worries day to day about dying from malaria contracted from a mosquito bite? It ranks up there with polio and typhoid.   But what would the "ban DDT no matter what the cost" environmentalists be saying if HIV suddenly became transmittable by mosquitoes? Would they continue to argue "we have no idea how many millions of people have been impacted by DDT's use" if they were one mosquito bite away from a death sentence with no cure (as peoples of the third world don't have or can't afford a cure for malaria)?  Nope, you can bet your bottom dollar virtually every one of them would change their tune pretty quickly--especially here in San Francisco. All their objections about "long term damage to the environment" and "resistance to insecticide" would suddenly transform into a mere theory once faced with the possibility their own lives could be in mortal danger. Activists would be storming the streets demanding the return of DDT with the same vengeance they exhibit today when marching for a solution to HIV/AIDS. Because it's a different story when it's no longer someone else's life that's on the line.  And hence we would have an even clearer expression of the hypocrisy of the new environmental imperialism they impose on the third world today--the kind that makes activists feel better about themselves from the comfort of latte studios and Volvo station wagons. Every day they tell the third world "we have cures for these diseases that you don't, so it matters not to us that our environmental crusade will take away your line of defense and you die by the millions" in exchange for good conversation at Starbucks. It's an easy trade when mosquito-borne death isn't tugging at *your* arm every day. 
 The design of this ice cream maker leaves a lot to be desired. Only small cracked or shaved ice will fit around the tub and the plastic lid is already showing signs of wear. 
 I bought this CD because Roy Hargrove has a good reputation. What a disappointment! It sounds like an intermediate high school student learning to play the flugelhorn. Boring solos, dull tone, small range, and lack of interesting ideas. Also, the tempos are all the same slow beat while he does nothing to spice it up. He should be embarrassed to have this album released 
 i saw this for a good price.  i checked for reviews.  there were all theese great reviews. whatever!  the movie has pretty  much no action.  the sound video actin is good, but its lonngg and sloowww.  there was some good nudity.  that is the only thing keepin me from totally considering this as a loss. ok movie jus dont expect action jus anticipate the nudity cause that is the only thing interesting besides the falcon in this movie. i love falcons, so there you go.  i think of it as good enough to keep thats it. maybe ill pop it in to watch a long slow movie with a girlfriend. take this as the downside review so all theese other reviews don fool you into thinking this movie is all tha 
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 This hair dryer never feels hot, even on the high setting and my hair never feels dry...which means frizz will appear later. The switches are impossible to operate if you have even the slightest amount of hair product on your fingers. Instead of taking half the time to dry, it takes much longer than my previous $19 blow dryer - with or without the ionic switch on. Also it's awkward to hold because the "cool" button is located right where your thumb should naturally go so you have to cramp your hand unless you want to be blown cool. Not a good product. I plan to return mine and try something else 
 Literary critic should have titled this little guide `What to Read and Why,' seeing as he devotes only a few paragraphs to why reading might be valuable. That said, Bloom is a terrifyingly accomplished reader, but he isn't much of a thinker or a critic in the way Benjamin or Derrida were. Bloom's incessant propensity to judge all literature from the `how is this compared to Shakespeare' lens is foolish and lacking in any insight. At times his criticism seems almost amateurish and rushed. He doesn't seem to be a very good reader of Hemingway, for instance. At the outset of a review of `Hills Like White Elephants,' Bloom writes that "Hemingway's personal mystique-his bravura poses as warrior, big-game hunter, bullfighter, and boxer-is irrelevant to `Hills Like White Elephants' as its male protagonist's insistence that `You know that I love you'" (47). Yet later in Bloom's review, he writes [on `The Snows of Kilimanjaro']: The irony is at Hemingway's expense, insofar as Harry prophesies the Hemingway who, nineteen days shor of his sixty-second birthday, turned a double-barreled shotgun on himself" (49). Bloom seems to have reversed tactics here. Never the less, Bloom is an undeniably great reader of poetry; in this volume he tells you all about his personal favorites: Stevens, Whitman, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, etc. Kind of fun, but far from great criticism.  
 Worthless and waste of time and money.  There is no  great strategies discussed in the book, book is throughout boring and  repeating. Author sees the reader as a potential customer. You have a feeling that you were listering to a salesman aggressively trying to sell his products 
 Of all the textbooks I've had, from elementary school through graduate school, this is easily the worst one I've ever had, for any course.   First of all, the authors so redundantly use the word "whilst" and the phrase "rules of the game" that it really gets on your nerves. My classmates all agree with me on this point.   Second, speaking of getting on your nerves, half of what these authors say is, "...as we talked about in the previous chapter" or "as we'll talk about in the next chapter". There is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size, and hell, it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course.   Third, the authors should win a Pulitzer prize for flowery language. They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. Their sentences are far too long. They don't know the meaning of clear and concise, and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101. They'd be great politicians, because never have I heard anyone say so much and yet say so little....over and over and over again.  The book is a like an inflated academic paper...and it's BORING. If ever a topic begged for a case-study approach, it's this one, and this book is not the answer. Save your money, and beg your instructor not to use this text.  
 THERE ARE PLENTY OF WORDS I COULD USE TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM BUT LETS JUST PUT IT THIS WAY: I DOWNLOADED THIS ALBUM, YES FOR FREE, FREE!!! AND DIDNT EVEN BOTHER BURNING IT I DELTED IT RIGHT OFF MY COMPUTER. AMAZINGLY BA 
 The early entries in the book (first 100 pages) are very interesting tales of unconventional lives revealing the author's confusion with his/her ethnicity.  However, after ten or so entries, the reading becomes old and repitive revealing many Americans need to preach their problems.  Being biracial/multicultural is not a problem but a gift which I can personally attest.  The readings need more creativity in establishing a point that is engaging but captivating.  Its too easy to simply say back when I was 4 I came to the realization that... and over and over again.  With this book all I can say is find the entry which most relates to your personal history because this book proves that the whole is not greater than the sum, of a portion mind you,of its parts 
 This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon.  Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks.  Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype.  Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier. 
 I will not try to say that I asserted the painstaking, analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of Heidegger. More than that, I have no interest in doing so. It is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being (existence), and my reading didn't lead me to any other conclusions. So as I said I have no interest in reading this a second time, further, deeper, or slower.  Being and Time is chock full of invented terminology, to the extent that Michael Inwood was able to profit from his publication of A Heidegger Dictionary. Whatever you might think the word "world" means, for instance, is not what Heidegger means, and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so. This is the case with his entire vocabulary. If there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by Heidegger, I would not bring this up as a crticism.  Beyond the unventilated, severely sober, and utterly uninspiring character of Being in Time, I also call attention to the futility of it's project. If Heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being, perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him: that there is no question of being.   Why is "the question of being" so problematic? Because it is unanswerable, maybe. Or if it is answerable, we're not in any position to answer it. "Being" implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn't make sense. And if you posit an idea that is so concrete, so constant, you can't just bend it to make it fit reality. You've already betrayed your questioning. Truth, including the truth of being, is a local phenomenon. Truth is not always and forever true - it's true when it's true. But Heidegger wanted an everlasting truth, a dogmatic anthropology.  Worse than the general uselessness of his project, and the toxic dregs left in his wake, Heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thought-provoking way 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 After hearing good things about the authors previous book I felt I should I should read this new book- but the title is very misleading (in my opinion) and there are quotes from Mary e.g. `we don't want bonuses! (p145) Joint Venture (p220) - which I felt were way of the mark - these were experiences the author had encountered - but my personal opinion is that these did not add much value to the concept promoted in the books title i.e. implementing lean software ... this is up for debate  On a +ve note the book does have some snippets of wisdom and an example of one is "Every bit of code that is there and not needed creates complexity that will plague the code base for the rest of its life (p25)  My advice scan the book before buying...   
 The movies wasn't what I expected.  I thought it would be more raw, instead, it was full of talk and interviews.   If you are looking for something like that, this is what you are looking for.  If you are looking for raw footage, this is not for you 
 Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book. 
 First, the content is not well-organized.  TV programs and TV memories are generational, so it doesn't make sense to mix images from the 50s-90s together.    Second, the photographs have little impact.  The book itself is rather small, and some pages contain clusters of small photos that compete for your attention.  Third, there is little interesting commentary.  A good nostalgia book should describe how pop culture and society influenced each other.  This little book doesn't begin to do justice to the most powerful medium of our age 
 This book is very readable, but at time to time it reads very srangely. Its told in first person, then third person, and some of the plot left a yukky taste in my mouth,and was quite disbelieving. It's quite a sophomore effort from Jane Green, and lets hope with more writing practice she gets better 
 has anyone taken this formula during natural childbirth and does it help?????? please respond 
 I agree with a previous reviewer who stated "It was too basic...this is stuff any college kid would know."  However, that being said, one can't just start in the middle of a topic and write a book.  I thought it was more like reading a business cards for dummies edition type book.  If you are new and starting out in the business world and never owned a business card, then you should probably read this.  Not to say I didn't find a few useful tips, but this book certainly hasn't turned my business upside down or changed my life as the editiorial reviews would lead you to believe.  Those reviews were probably written by close friends and family. I walk away from this glad I didnt pay full price and got free shipping on the book.  
 As an American with shoddy French skills who has been living in the Il de France for the past six months, I found this book incredibly superficial at best and whiny and self-indulgent at worst.  First of all, to call this book a love story is ridiculous.  Frederic has less presence in the book than her pedigreed dog (or was THAT the "love story"?). From what I read, poor old Frederic seemed no more than a ticket to stay in France, rent free, because she had nothing better to do. And let me see, what were her insights?  That French is difficult?  That French people like meat?  Wow, great journalism, there.  One day in France is all you need to figure that out.  As far as her assessments on the psychology of French women (they're threatened, which explains their lack of friendliness towards her), what self-serving balderdash is that?  Let me propose a few alternate theories:  A) threatened and rude women come in every nationality; B) maybe they weren't talking to her because it's difficult to communicate with someone with lousy French skills; C) Maybe they just didn't like HER. For the life of me, I don't understand the positive reviews of this book.  But maybe in an age of CNN, MTV and people who travel no further than to the other side of their living room to search for their lost remote control, this is what qualifies for insightful journalism/entertainment. Now, Ms. Turnbull might attribute my negativity towards her book to some sort of jealousy since I have had none of the advantages she had while living here.  I pay rent.  I knew no-one when I got here.  I was forced to communicate without the convenience of a fluent boyfriend to translate for me.  I had to make friends based on personality, wit and mime skills.  But I'd like to suggest that if she'd had some of those "disadvantages" (and a little depth) her book might have been less annoying, more interesting and worth the short time spent reading it 
 I have this book. This book is a poor atempt at up dateing a drafting book to a CAD world.  The CAD parts of this book are small and short. They were added to an existing book to bring it into the 1980-90's. The seems to be witten by a school teacher not a practiceing Architect with very little background into what is done in a small Architectal firm. I have not looked at the new addition but here is what it needs, a total rework of the existing material to bring it up to the year 2000, along with a CD-ROM that includes all the question at least one or two full sets of house plans. First a stock set of plan would allow the teacher to due a room addition project, change to a set of stock plans. a second set of plans be unfinished just the outline of the house, and a door and window schedule with blocks of all the windows, other drawing could be started also. It's not worth the ..., when there are up to date books for far less money. A stock set of plan would allow the teacher to due a room addition project, change a set of stock plans. a second set of plans could be unfinished just the outline of the house, and a door and window schedule with blocks of all the windows 
 It was time to get a new cordless phone and I bought this because it was on sale, and featured hard number buttons -- I find it more difficult to dial phones with soft, squishy buttons. Bad decision. You can't hear anyone even with the volume set to maximum, the answering system is just as bad in terms of registering voices, and apparently no one can hear me. I plugged in my headset to the jack, and they can hear me, but I can't hear them. There is static everywhere -- you can't use it in range of fluorescent lights, TVs, computers, speakers, etc. In a small house with compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere, try that! This phone is worthless and if I can return it, I will 
 Books have been written, and will continue to be written, to try and disprove Christianity and Jesus as the Son of God. What is almost comical is that one has to print lies and errors to try and convince people. That's because you can't disprove the TRUTH. And what are some of the errors, you ask? I will give you a few: Dan Brown tries to use Gnostic gospels (gospels written in the 2nd century and beyond by people who were not eyewitnesses) to try and prove his theory and omitting New Testament Scripture. To say that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married by using the Gospel of Phillip (written after 250 A.D.) where there are missing words: And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] more than [...] the disciples, [...] kiss her [...] on her [...]. Clearly, there is some problems with this text with the missing words and the fact that it was written over 200 years after Jesus died. This does not prove anything. Also, he says that the word "companion" means spouse in Aramaic, which is great, except that the Gospel of Philip was written in "Coptic," where "companion" does not mean "spouse!" Second, Dan Brown says that it wasn't until 325 AD at the Council of Nicea did people start to believe Jesus was a Deity and that it was a close vote. New Testament disproves that because it shows that Jesus was Deity where Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5: "For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve." Also, The Council of Nicea met only to sort out some differences among church leaders, all of whom believed that Jesus was divine. The main question was whether Jesus was begotten or made. Jesus' divinity, death and resurrection were not in question. Only two of 318 clerics at the Council did not sign the Nicene Creed. So there was not a close vote unless you think 318 to 2 is close! Third, his main argument is that it Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper painting by Leo. If that were true, then where is John, the youngest and most beloved apostle? John was often portrayed in a feminine manner to convey youth, as is seen in many stained glass portraits in European cathedrals. And also, Leo was just a painter who was not around when Jesus was, so it didn't matter if he tried to put Mary in a painting or not! Fourth, Brown says that The Gnostic gospels and the Dead Sea Scrolls are "the earliest Christian records." While the New Testament obviously came before the Gnostic gospels, The Dead Sea Scrolls refer to a collection of about 900 documents, many of which are fragmentary scrolls written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic, that were discovered in a cave and do not contain even a single mention of Jesus or of any other person mentioned in the New Testament as they are Jewish documents! He also says they were discovered in the 1950's when they were discovered in 1947. Oops! Fifth, Dan Brown says that Christianity borrowed its beliefs from the pagan religion of Mithraism. He says that Mithraism worshipped the pre-Christian God Mithras, called the Son of God and Light of the World, who was born on December 25th, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. Scholars of Mithraism would strongly disagree with Brown on all of these points. Nowhere is Mithras given the title Son of God and the Light of the World. Brown apparently made this up because it sounded good. Mithras was born on December 25th, however this proves nothing. The New Testament never associated December 25th with the birth of Christ. The early Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Christ on this day intentionally to oppose the pagan mid-winter festival of Saturnalia. They never claimed Jesus was actually born on that date. The claim that Mithras died and was buried in a rock tomb is just not true. Scholars will tell you that in Mithraism there is no death of Mithras at all. So, there was no rock tomb and no resurrection. So once again, he is nowhere near correct. Lastly, Brown says that the four canonical gospels were chosen from over 80 gospels. First, there were only less than half that many books written about Jesus life. The two Gnostic gospels Brown relies on most heavily weren't written until the second century A.D., long after the New Testament gospels were written. It makes sense that the Gnostic gospels came about in the late second century, as this is when Gnostic thought was most prevalent. However, the New Testament was complete before the end of the 1st Century. Also, the Gospel of Thomas, which Dan Brown lies heavily on,claims women must become men in order to receive salvation. That makes no sense. There are many other errors in this novel, but I think I have showed there are enough lies in this book not to be taken seriously. This is pure (or rather "poor") fiction, without a shred of evidence that Jesus was anything other than the Christ, the Son of the living God! Thank you, Dan Brown, for making my faith stronger 
 Kyle Played guitar with Dr Know early on. He is a ripping guitarist too. Then he played guitar and sang after everyone realized he is a better singer too. Dr Know wasn't much until Kyle took over, a few songs on a some Mystic comps. Plug in Jesus, is what really got Dr Know going. Brandon just reemerged when being a punk wocka got really trendy. Check out his teen beat style posters. Ughhh.  I saw them with Brandon and the whole show sucked. Maybe one of the worst I've seen, and I've been going to hardcore shows for over 20 years   Then he does the DK Kennedy's thing trying yet again to flog a dead horse. Although I don't blame the guys for trying to recoupe some of the dough that Jello ripped them off for. Jello sucks too. He is so impressed with what a smart guy he thinks he is. He is just a con man too.  Any way Brandon isn't a totally bad guy. He just sucks as a singer. As a skater he's OK. Any way his brother sang for Stallag 13 which isn't to bad of a band.  But, if you are talking Dr Know it is all about Kyle. He made the band what they are. With his distinctive guitar style and then the singing. He was the driving force behind every record they put out until this new living of the corpse of hardcore thing started happening.   Now if Doug Moody would quite being an Ass and rerelease more of the old mystic stuff. Sure I have the records, but who wants to bust out the turntable these days. 
 I must go easier on this film than I would like seeing as it was made in the 50s. Being 19, I'm sure I can't appreciate the calm and painfully cheesy medea of that era. Still, I AM a fan of old movies and enjoy the laid back plots of the older days. O brother. This plot was certainly laid back - in fact, I think it laid all the way back and went to sleep! Three girls fall for three guys. The end! Each girl ended up with the first guy they liked, no surprises or intrigues. There was a gliche to each relationship, but it was ironed out smoothly before you could actually figure out what the big deal was. Two of the men were goony dreamboats, madly in love with their American beauties. The other was a cranky boss who tried terribly hard to be endearing but missed the mark by a mile. Quite predicatable, extremely boring... stick with the good oldies such as Born Yesterday, On The Town, Roman Holiday and the like.  
 After reading all of the reviews on this book I was left confused by the extreme selection of critiques. After seeing the beautiful carrot cakes on the cover I decided this could hardly be the work of a "sloppy" decorator and went ahead and ordered. What can I say, the cover most definitely does not reflect the level of work inside, which can only be described as ..well.. sloppy! My 12 year old daughter had produced better looking cookies than these!! I can't say anything about the recipes because quite frankly none of them inspired me to try. The only thing that interested me was the explanation on how to make checkerboard or pinwheel cookies, but I didn't need to buy a book just for that. So, if you're undecided about whether to purchase this book as I was, my advice is save your money 
 This book is a mixture of interviews (that are quite interesting) and insight (that is too thinly explained and mostly concerns IT companies). The book IS of small size and easily portable, which seems to be the main promise, and it says it includes quick tips (it delivers, some), but also speedy solutions (doesn't deliver, because they don't exist, and most of the explanations and case studies are too short and superficial for anything to be learned from them) and cutting-edge ideas (for one business only). Suffices as a series of facts and listing of interesting company names, but not much help for a practitioner, and for a MBA degree a student would need many many many more books. 
 since there is little to no mystery involved in the story.  I should have expected this, since this has been the trend for the last 4 or 5 books in the series.  I had put off reading this one for precisely that reason but needed something to read for the weekend so I decided to give it a try.  The best thing that can be said about this "Turkey" is that it's a quick read, so it's good for a plane ride, but if you want something that remotely resembles a mystery pass this one up and read one of the first books by this author which really were engaging and satisfying mysteries.    Even as a glimpse into the small town life of Moose County this one falls flat.  It used to be that one of the charms of the series was the way Braun had developed the world of Moose County and all the foibles of its inhabitants and if tragedy struck one you really felt for them.  In this book, characters from previous books are randomly introduced and they wander around aimlessly and there is no emotional depth to Qwill's relationship with any of them.     The other problem that has happened to the series is that Braun fell in love with her own character.  Qwill started the series as a flawed charcter.  In "Turkey" there is even more rapturous description of Qwill's mustache and wonderful voice than usual, not to mention the ovations for the ridiculous Big Storm production.  We are supposed to believe that it is so well received that there are to be several performances a week throughout the summer - how big is the population of Moose county?    SPOILER ALERT:  But to cap off the ridiculousness of this book, Qwill leaves his beloved Koko out in the gazebo with a confessed murderer who is strung out on drugs.  The Qwill of past books would never have intentionally put either cat in danger like this.    According to her fan club web page, she was born in 1916 so now she's pushing 90.  It's possible she's in poor health. Because of this I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and agree with those who suggest this book was ghost-written based on notes she made.  That would account for inconsistencies in plot and style.  The only good part of this book - the only reason it deserves even one star - is the description of YumYum playing with her thimble (but even it is taken from another of Braun's books).  It's on page 72 - read it, then find something else to read.          
 We went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick, much less anyting with Jamie Lee Curtis. It came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it. Whether the movies promised to be good or bad, we went and had fun with them either way. This one we had fun in how bad it was. This was one of those, "picked on, pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank, only to come back with genius killer skills, somehow attained super strength and the speed of the Road Runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play." In short, there's nothing to be believed in this stinker. LIke a "Friday the 13th" flick, you merely wait for the kills, and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends, and pray for that to come as soon as possible. The movie pulls out the stops, giving us Curtis for eye candy and David Copperfield to amaze us, perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect. But in general, this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a "Halloween" type thriller. There's too much stupidity from the victims, oh, until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together. There's too much "not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison." And given her presence, there's just not enough Jamie Lee to make this crock worth sitting through. We had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre. It made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse, more predictable, and far too numerous to maintain our interest. This movie got that ball rolling. Don't waste your time. You'll get more excitement out of watching Jamie Lee's finger nails dry for a couple hours 
 The story was awful.  Don't spend your money on this one.  Borrow it from the library 
 I concur with the majority of negative reviews of this book. I'm no prude, but the excessive use of profanity throughout this book is tiresome and honestly lazy on the part of the author. If you enjoy endless narcisstic tirades by disgruntled writers and agree with the main characters that the only good use of a woman is to provide oral satisfaction, this is the book for you. Otherwise, don't subject yourself to 376 pages of slop I don't think can even be called literature. I will not be reading any more of Mr. Tosches' work, you can be sure 
 It's a good idea to find out what financiers like George Soros are thinking because it may give some hints of what is in our future.  His book, "The Crisis of Global Capitalism" was rushed into print "at breakneck speed." That should give a hint about Soros' power and influence.   Soros, once a Hungarian Jewish refugee, is now a big shot.  When he isn't masterminding international financial scams or working toward world government, he makes public appearances, testifies before Congress, and writes books.  The stimulus for the book was the global financial crisis that began in Thailand in July 1997. The crisis steamrolled through the economies of many nations, collapsing the Russian banking system before the recovery began.  Malaysia shut down its financial markets to foreigners, pointing to Soros as the source of the problem.  After that close brush with global economic meltdown, perhaps Soros is trying to convince us that we should create a mechanism to clean up after his meddling.  Soros' "remedy" is international supervision over the national authorities.  World government.  How much world government is enough? "You cannot have a common market without a common currency. You cannot have a common currency without a common fiscal policy, including some kind of centralized tax collection."  And of course he says we need the International Criminal Court.  Still not enough world government for you?    "A society without social values cannot survive and a global society needs universal values to hold it together." In case you missed it, we are talking about a global religion.  Maybe world government is like sex--you can't be a little bit pregnant, and you can't have a little bit of global government.  Soros clouds the issue with a lot of talk about "open societies," although world government would be anything but that.  Soros touts democracy and open societies, but he obviously favors bureaucratic secrecy over an open society. Soros favors some type of powerful paternalistic oligarchy that falls somewhat short of actual totalitarianism-or better yet, makes people think that it stops short of totalitarianism.  This book is loaded with contradictions.  Soros' definition of an open society diametrically opposes his desired stable society.  Soros calls Communism a cure worse than the disease, yet he maintains that we must put common interest ahead of self-interest.  He says that the US can't go it alone, yet somehow the US can save the world.    Soros is too dishonest to admit that pumping capital from advanced nations to the third world will lower US living standards, although he predicts that the US will have to dismantle the social safety net to become more competitive.  Soros decries the profit motive as the basis of human behavior, but what other motive is there for international capital flight and destroying national sovereignty?    What does internationalism deliver?  If you look at the US in the age of internationalism, then the answer is war, low wages, unemployment, and loss of self-reliance.  The fact is, free movement of capital is a relatively recent phenomenon. At the end of the Second World War, economies were largely national in character. Since 1980, the balance has swung so far in favor of financial capital that multinational corporations and international financial markets have supplanted national sovereignty. The ability of a nation to provide for the welfare of its citizens has been impaired by the ability of capital to escape paying taxation and decent wages by moving elsewhere.  Regarding the 1977 financial crisis that sparked this book, the international financial system itself constituted the main ingredient in the meltdown process.  The big difference with China was that its currency is not convertible; otherwise it's economy would have been exposed to the "wrecking ball," as Soros puts it.  The countries that kept their financial markets closed weathered the storm better than those that were open.  India was less affected than the Southeast Asian countries; China was better insulated than Korea. 
 Seriously, do waste your money. If you feel that the Harry Potter books could jeopardize your child's development as a Christian then go out and buy one before you child does and read or skim through the book and MAKE YOUR OWN decision.  I can't possibly understand why someone would need to get a book to tell them if the Harry potter series is good for--YOUR--children. This is something that should be your opinion. Not that of a writer, who in my opinion, is just trying to make some extra "Christian" money off some easily persuasive Christians.  I'm not going to sit here and tell that your crazy for thinking the--FICTIONAL--Harry Potter is evil and against gods words and is in line with Lucifer himself. I would like to point out that god gave us all brains to use and make decisions for ourselves. Don't let someone try to push their opinion on you, and definitely don't get book that is doing the same and making you pay for.   This book is just sad and makes me really question the Christian community.   In close I think the writer of this book is simply trying to make some extra cash off of those gullible and easily persuaded by other peoples opinions. Very "Christian" indeed. 
 Bad, bad and bad. This book could have been condensed down to 5 chapters to tell the story.  It was dragged out for no other reason then to make it a full book.  I have enjoyed this authors other books, but this was was very disappointing.  Save your money on this one ladies 
 My 9-year-old daughter absolutely loved the book.  I thought I would get the movie for her so that she can get a visual sense of what rural life is like in America.  Specifically, I wanted her to see how Marty's family is rural and poor yet proud and dignified.  Unfortunately, none of that came through very well in the movie.  In fact, the "ruralness" and poverty aspects did not come through at all!  Also, what's the deal with this absolutely unnecessary character named Sam??  Finally, this movie also failed to present the various ethical dilemmas that Marty had to face in his attempt to rescue Shiloh 
 I also reviewed Graysmith's "Zodiac" and said that it was a great story crying out for a better writer. This book lacks a great story and is written less well than the first. There are passages in this book which are so garbled and confusing that the meaning can't be discovered at all, even if you read them five or six times. I put it down about a third of the way through after reading and re-reading a passage about the significance of the Mt. Diablo map that was utterly bewildering. I don't intend to finish it 
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 This is a rip off. This is word for word taken from the middle of another book he wrote previously.  This is the last F Paul Wilson Book I will ever purchase.  There ought to be laws against plagarizing your own self.  This $15 book is an excerpt from his previous novels. It is 93 pages of large type that would be 40 pages of normal text and it adds nothing to the story line. It is just repeating what was already written in his previous work.  This is scum - if there was a rank for zero stars, I would have used it 
 I had ordered this product originally hoping for a good quality portable dvd player.  This product is defintely portable and the screen being small was not a bad picture, but after having this product for a day I found that the power supply that came with it for charging the battery and also allowing you to plug directly in the electrical outlet was faulty. It would shut off for no apparent reason and when I played with the connection and was able to get it running again I had to start from the beginning with what I was watching.  I returned this item in hopes that I had just received a bad one, unfortunately the replacement I received did the exact same thing.  
 I was actually disappointed with this book.  I've read 10-15 books by Robin Jones Gunn and I enjoyed all of them except this one.  I found the plot boring & I had a difficult time finishing it.  The first seven books in this series were great.  Once I started reading them I couldn't put them down.  I think I finished each of them in 2 evenings they were so good.  Not sure what happened with this one. 
 I really didnt find answers to anything regarding the meaning or essence of money.  Only the authors confused philosophy.  He is obviously brought up in a Jewish household which holds money tantamount to the highest esteem one can get from life.  Money is an energy, nothing more.  I dont want to hear anymore neurotic ramblings on about this subject from this guy 
 Ehrman believes that God never inspired the writers of the Bible to write what God wanted written.  Therefore, inspiration is meaningless.  Furthermore, Ehrman believes that God could not, and did not insure that accurate translations of the original manuscripts were done.  In other words, English reading people have a Bible that is neither true to the orginal manuscripts, nor reliable for doctrine.  To Ehrman, the Bible is, for all practical purposes, useless.  As a believer, I strongly disagree with Ehrman and I recommend that this book, and anything else he writes, be viewed as the unlearned opinions of an infidel 
 The greatest problem with Bevans' models of contextual theology is that they are so acontextually constructed, so much so that it must be asked whether his typology of models is a misguided attempt.  The Korean theologian Cyris Moon (himself a likely candidate of contextual theologian, although his work is not discussed in Bevans' book) expresses this reservation eloquently: 'the attempt to systematize contextual theologies into a local and ordered set of models seems to contradict the situational, cultural and political idiosyncrasies that these theologies embody'.  Likewise, Charles Kraft, who is featured by Bevans as an intellectual sponsor of the translation model, voices his genuine dissatisfaction that he fails to identify with either of the examples Bevans uses.   This insensitivity on the part of Bevans is not only explainable but almost expected.  As "ideal types", the models are bound to fail to capture the reality; and insofar as they are constructed by a process of abstraction, they are necessarily decontextualizing.  The examples, when used as illustrations of the models, are not only decontextualized from their original contexts of the actual encounter with the concrete Others.  Much more importantly, these real life examples of contextual theology are decontextualized from their original motivations (which might be theological, political, cultural, etc.) and pre-emptively recontextualized by the presuppositions of the abstract model to which the examples do not necessarily subscribe.  No wonder the models constructed always fail to do justice to the examples presented.   And at a more profound level of methodology, we suspect that the root problem is Bevans' metaphysical commitment to the idea that contextual theology is something BOTH radically new AND traditional.  The claim that (authentic) theology has always been contextual becomes a metaphysical, a priori statement about what theology IS.  If theology is always contextual, what does "contextual theology" distinguish?  If everything is contextual, the entire notion of "contextual theology" will have limited descriptive or evaluative value, if at all.  This difficulty is perhaps also sensed by Schreiter, who attempts in his foreword to the book to rescue the term by further specifying its reference: contextual theologies are 'both those that are consciously contextual and those that are best understood from their contexts' (p.x).  Unfortunately such catch-all equivocation does not help much - it is still not clear what is NOT referred to by "contextual theology" if so understood.  There will be little for us - or for Bevans either - to hang on to in deciding what models should be in and what should be out.  In the last analysis, the models will be as good and useful as the examples invoked to flesh them out.  But then, do the models help us understand the examples, or vice versa?  Which is the familiar, and which is the unfamiliar?  What analytic or explanatory purchase we may gain from understanding the examples AS models OF contextual theology?   The artificiality and superficiality of the models contribute to this sense of lack of orientation in the "map" Bevans provides (p.32, Fig.2) - which is in fact the "model" of models of contextual theology.  The translation model and the anthropological model look like caricatures of each other, and one's virtue is presented as the other's vice.  One wonders who would prefer such false and forced opposites of extremes to the more sensible synthetic model.  As for the transcendental model, the praxis model and the counter-contextual model, they are not models OF contextual theology at all, they are actually on a par with Bevans' "model of models" of contextual theology on the same meta-level as perspectives ON what theology IS.  Bevans says that theology is/has to be contextual, these models emphasise instead respectively the transcendental (self-appropriating) nature, the praxis orientation, and the prophetic dimension of all theology.  Bevans is perhaps half-conscious of this difficulty as the transcendental model is plotted on his map as standing out oddly among the other models (ibid.).    Finally, the most severe criticism of Bevans' "model of models" is perhaps that it does not allow any role for God to play in contextualization.  (I do NOT mean that authors of the theologies deployed by Bevans as examples share the same oversight.  Quite the contrary, and THIS obviously counts against Bevans, not the authors he discusses.)  Contextualization becomes an entirely human enterprise, or an instrument under control (all you need is to pick and choose among the six different tools).  There is no room for the surprising work of God in the matter.    On how to do theology by taking the contexts seriously, there are many other better books I would recommend, e.g. Schreiter's _Constructing Local Theologies_. 
 I am appalled at the greed that Disney must have to milk out a classic like "The Absent Minded Professer". I found this to be one of the worst if not the worst remake of any movie. I found the plot to be too embelished as it made for the relationship between the characters played by Robin Williams and Marsha Gay-Hayden to be one of where it either tried to remake the safe and easy happy ending that's throughout all Disney movies, or it showed to be one where the parties had to wear their hearts out on their sleeves. I also feel that with the Character of "Flubber" it was a waste of time considering I don't remember any merchandising from the character. They should've stayed with the bouncing rubber balls from the original. I also feel that with the promotion of the Flubber substance that it was all shallow, and commericial as where in the original it was going to be put to good use in the military, and here it was to make a buck. I feel that there are some movies that are best to just be left in original state, and not be remade, and this is one of them. 
 "Oleanna" was a very, very frustrating read for me. First of all, a lot of it probably has to do with the fact that it is meant to be seen and heard, not read. Nonetheless, I'm convinced that a lot of the frustration is intentional. Everything the characters say is mixed up, incompleted, and confusing. The author, or playwright, Mamet, seems to have a very condescending opinion, almost disgust, for the English language. The confusion and misunderstanding is written in a way that makes our language appear almost pointless. I can't help but thinking to myself that anything can be put in a bad light, and shown to be a source of evil and violence, but why make a point of it (at least when its fundamentally unchangeable, like our basic language)? From my reading, I took the conclusion of the story to be something like "Language is futile, and fails us when we need it most." Of all the things I've read in my college literature course, "Oleanna" has been the only thing to leave a distinctly sour taste in my mouth.  Perhaps I'm missing the beauty of the writing, or the composition, or something... but overall this seemed to be a very mean spirited and ultimately pointless read 
 I saw this movie in the theater some almost 30 years ago with my then partner and I definately remember the Love Making scene being hot and heavy though heavily shadowed in darkness. But the scene is completely gone in the DVD, as well as the kiss. Now why in the world would they cut that out!!!??? That was the whole point of going to see the movie at that time, it was on the cutting edge. One star because you screwed with the whole point of the movie "Making Love" 
 Rifat is so blinded by conspiracy theories that it makes his book laughable. Buy another book on  Remote Viewing 
 Mick Garris created the Showtime "Masters of Horror" series, so it is quite a surprise to discover that his first contribution to the show could not be properly called "horror" at all, let alone "masterful."  Mick has made a living out of adapting Stephen King novels for the screen (and we all know how those usually turn out), so it's no wonder that this little vignette plays like a short story with all the good parts cut out.  Jamie (played by a mealy-mouthed Henry Thomas) is lonely, divorced, and living on old toast when he begins to experience all of the sensations of a beautiful Canadian woman.  He smells what she smells, sees what she sees, feels what she feels.  (In true "Masters of Horror" fashion, many of these shared sensations involve sex and nudity.)  Ever more obsessed, Jamie tracks this woman down, only to discover her HORRIFYING SECRET!  What is her horrifying secret?  I'll tell you!    [SPOILER ALERT]   She is not a very nice person.  Also, for some reason, she keeps a gun under her couch.  I'm not joking. [END OF SPOILERS]  But seriously, this is just very, very bad entertainment.  In fact, the most creative part of the entire show is little more than a lame inside joke.  At one point, we catch a glimpse of a Stephen King novel, "Desperation," on Jamie's nightstand.  Ho ho!  Garris directed the TV adaptation of "Desperation," which just so happened to star both Thomas and Matt Frewer (who, in "Chocolate," has the only interesting character: Jamie's co-worker, Wally -- scientist-by-day, mohawked rock-n-roller by night).  The story of "Chocolate" is told in flashback by Jamie, who is sitting in a dark room, under a lamp, covered in blood.  He is being questioned by a cop, and his dull, pointless story unfolds as he answers each inquiry.  At the very end, when the cop has heard every, last, mind-numbing detail, the cop gives the penultimate line of the show:  "That's a hard story to sell."  You're right, Unnamed Cop.  It's a REALLY hard story to sell, especially when the salesmanship is this bad 
 Perhaps it's unfair of me to rate this book, since I didn't make it to the end.  It was disappointing, since I've liked others of Coover's books.  This one is written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyce/"Ulysses" (which I liked a lot).  Similarly, it also is incredibly literate and erudite, lots of language play which still somehow was mostly just hard and not fun the way language should and can be.  I could appreciate the humor intellectually, but it wasn't really funny.  The subject matter is a cynical take on a dark subject, the Rosenberg executions.  I can certainly understand why its release was so contoversial.  It might help to know more about the period but as someone who came of political age (later) during the Watergate years I know little about Nixon as VP and many of the social references were lost on me 
 While several books provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about other cultures, this novel is not one of them.  A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central characters, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make for quite possibly the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible, I would steer clear of this and instead pick up a copy of The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinback 
 This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked.  Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed. This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide 
 Jodie Foster Is one of the Greatest Actress's Ever period,but this clunky film is so boring&Predictable that it just never gets off the ground&put me to sleep. a film full of Cliches&dime a dozen story lines that never goes anywhere 
 For the times this movie was made, the acting is good. I would love to see this same story done in more modern times where I believe the acting would be less in the dramatic style and seem more real to life. If you've read the book, this movie cuts out so much of what I loved in the book. I wish not only that it would be done in modern times but I can see it being done in a trilogy style to capture all the interaction of characters and the essence of the story would be more complete. If you have to choose between the book and the movie, choose the book 
 Hehe, O.K. I bought the book -- it's not the first time I've thrown away money and won't be the last. After skimming through it and reading this guy's life story, which includes "voices" psychics, and god-knows what else, I can say that I refuse to waste my valuable time reading this clap-trap. Let me suggest that everyone thinking about buying this book, read THIS book first you will be doing yourself a lifelong favor 
 I was just overall very dissapointed.  I tried to make myself listen to this album but I could only do so a couple times before I gave up.  I thoroughly enjoy hip hop but much prefer Kool Keith or MF Doom or Gang Starr or other slightly less than mainstream artists 
 I obtained this book back in the eighties, when it cost $100(yes, that's right, I really wanted to get married in those days).  I got rid of it years ago, but I think that enough of it sticks in my mind that I can write a review.  One of the techniques she recommends is transference, which seems dangerously close to practicing psychiatry without a license.  She seems fixated on jewellry, particularly religious jewellry.  I actually wrote to her and asked if religious jewellry is such a turnoff, why do people think Madonna is so sexy? (This was in the eighties, remember)  Of course she didn't reply.  What really upset me about this book is the demeaning attitude toward men.  I guess that I'm too much of a romantic for such calculating approaches.  She says don't assume that you are different from other women and don't assume that the man you're after is that different from other men.  Excuse me?  Damn right he's different, and special, or I wouldn't care about him 
 This book is a collection of trends, theories and quotes from 10 to 25+ years ago. I believe the phrase "cutting edge" is used in the product description - this is clearly the work of an underemployed political speech writer. I decided to take a class - you know, to stay current and the instructor assigned this cluttered mess. Thankfully, I borrowed the book and can return it. The authors cram every possible diagram, chart and spiffy quote they can find into insanely long and disorganized chapters. But they have a secret plan. Throughout the chapters they refer to two assessment tools (conveniently offered on associated web sites) as THE solutions for ensuring successful CRM implementations. These assessment instruments are not in the book. Rather they must be accessed and I think paid for separately. So the cash you paid for the book is merely an advertising fee (someone has to pay for this stuff) and when you have read the last page and close the book you'll know what you don't have - one of those assessments they keep talking about. If you took an organizational behavior course, or a project management course, or occasionally read a trade publication or two, you'll definitely recognize most of the concepts in the book. If you actually finished your degree, you probably won't want either of the assessments. Now, I was given the option of rating this book with between 1 and 5 stars. I had no choice but to give it one star. But if I could give it a dead rat or stinky fish rating, I would choose one of those instead.  Save your money for a harmonica 
 If you go the largest imported books bookstore in Beijing, which is located in Wangfujing, and grab this title from the shelves, you will find that several paragraphs in the book have been covered with a white paper strip: my own educated guess is that one probably dealt with Beijing's traffic congestion and the other with a certain bloody episode which happened on Tian'anmen Square in 1989.  I asked an employee what this meant. "The content must have been politically harmful", was the answer. There was no trace of embarassment in his voice. Business as usual...    Nevertheless, the book is available. Who will want to buy a blatantly censored copy for what is still a high price remains an open question. This may sound anecdotal but it isn't. It just shows how little things have really changed although China is reputedly the land of Change. I must congratulate the author for having written some "politically incorrect" stuff about Peking (let's stick to the old name, it is so much easier to pronounce), but I have to disagree with his general appraisal of the city. It is quite true that, as he states in the preface, Peking has been  a "global irrelevance" for many decades, but it is simply false to claim that it is now an "exciting time" to visit the Chinese capital.    Think about this: John Blofeld (1913-1987), a British scholar who wrote books on Eastern philosophy and religion, and traveled extensively in Asia, including China, reports in one of his travelogues that when he visited Peking in what are for us "the good old times", before the Communist takeover that is, local people were already complaining that the old ways had disappeared.   Today, more than half a century later, after the Great Cultural Revolution and the demolition of the magnificent city walls, Peking finds itself in the midst of what in fact amounts to a second Cultural Revolution: an unprecedented, huge urban overhaul designed to turn it into a futuristic metropolis.   To sum it all up, Peking has completely lost its soul and one must ask: Where is the excitement, really? Are we talking about the five-stars hotels with their international buffets? Are we talking about the fact that local people can now buy French foie gras in the nearest supermarket? Are we talking about those glass and steel skyscrapers that have turned large areas of the city into what looks like a kind of alien Martian base? If that is something that makes you excited, yes, then by all means do visit the city. You will be satisfied.   Leaving aside the architectural monstrosities of the recent past and those that are being built in complete disregard to the ancient city environment, let us have a look at Peking's much publicized cultural heritage. Is it really worth seeing?   My answer is a definite NO. Keep your money for Pompeii, Tikal, Versailles or Angkor Vat. First of all, unless you are acquainted with Chinese culture, chances are that you will not be able to appreciate what you see. Just as it takes some time to appreciate a book or a piece of music. The reason is that Chinese architecture is not spectacular at all. And it is quite devoid of originality. If you have seen one pagoda, you have seen them all. Besides, you probably can't read Chinese characters. Chinese art is an extension of the writing system.   But there are many other factors that combined will probably make a visit to Peking quite disappointing, if not infuriating (for a sensitive traveler, that is). First of all, the crowds of tourists, both foreign and Chinese. They are overwhelming (and unfortunately most interesting sites have rather short opening hours). Second, the ruthless commercialism and incredibly bad taste: the merchants of the Temple are omnipresent. I am not only talking about nagging vendors, souvenirs shops, noisy fast-foods and bars inside the premises, but also about big and small advertising boards and a multitude of ugly modern artefacts that mar both the great monuments and the more modest ancient alleys ("hutongs").   A few examples: if you go to the Forbidden City, you will find pistachio green plastic garbage cans everywhere. The benches inside the palace all bear advertising plaques for a company that sells air conditioners. If you visit the( few remaining)hutongs, you will find that the old houses are lined with brand-new cars and that their faï¿½ades are marred by big air conditioners. Near the Forbidden City, the hutongs are dotted with ugly telephone booths in the shape of an orange mushroom (yes!)every five or ten meters. The tiles on most pavilions and pagodas are made of ugly, grey concrete (the real thing is too costly). There must be more than a hundred big, red fire extinguishers in the otherwise quite beautiful Lama Temple and there are alas not hidden from view. Roofs around Tian'anmen Square are bristling with huge, unsightly mobile phone towers. The wonderful animal and human statues in the Spirit Way, which is part of the huge Ming Tombs Site, are all flanked by a big plastic garbage can and they have built new roads on both sides of it: enough noise to scare away the spirits and prevent you from entering a meditative state...  Etc., etc., etc. There is no end to the list of things both small and great that spoil the remnants of the past in Peking and elsewhere in China, which shows just how culturally decadent Chinese people have become. One could without exaggeration say that today the urban culture in China is an extension of Las Vegas and Hollywood with some Chinese elements thrown in for good measure (and face!).   Sometimes the incongruities are so blatant, so ludicrous that one starts wondering if there isn't a kind of conspiracy, a deliberate attempt to debase and desecrate the past, which is after all just superstitious rubbish for a true Communist and a mere merchandise for a true Capitalist (they are pretty much the same in my opinion). The alliance of the two has produced what may be the biggest kitsch paradise on earth: Pe-kitsch.  The third point you need to keep in mind is the weather, which can be summed up as: cold winter smog, spring sandstorms and smog, summer sauna and smog (+heavy rains in July) and dry autumn smog. Twenty years ago(yes, I have lived that long here!), Peking had a Mediterranean climate of sorts with clear blue skies most of the time, but due to heavy traffic pollution the city has now smoky skies with no wind and therefore a suffocating atmosphere most of the time (let's say about 70 percent of the time). In many places, the air stinks with the smell of chemical paint. It is also full of dust particles from the thousands of construction sites, to say nothing of the exhaust fumes from the hundreds of thousands of trucks, bulldozers and private cars that race through narrow alleys and oversized avenues alike.    The fourth point is traffic. It is increasingly difficult to go from one place to another without being caught in huge traffic jams (the government actually encourages people to buy cars and they hope every household will have its own car by 2020!!!). The happy times when you could go around leisurely riding a bicycle are basically finished. Now the streets have become a battleground and cars crowd even the sidewalks. The subway network is pitifully inadequate and incredibly crowded. As another expat once said to me: "I never take the Beijing subway because to find the nearest subway station, I have first to take a taxi."  The fifth point is service. While young shop assistants and other employees are generally friendly (but not always competent), a large part of the local staff, specially in parks, museums and big supermarkets, is composed of (sexually frustrated?)middle-aged women who are rude, indifferent and lazy. There is a pervading mood of discontent and irritation in the city, which is quite comprehensible considering the high level of environmental stress, the lack of genuine community life (most "local" people are rootless domestic immigrants)and the political tyranny. Add to this the fierce competition for jobs, the money problems and all the cares inseparable from both great and modest affluence (blessed are the poor, indeed!). Almost everyone will try to rip you off. Money reigns supreme.    This is not to say that there aren't any beautiful or interesting places to see--the author of this guide has done a good job in this respect since he mentions not only the (fake) Great Wall at Badaling, but also other segments of the wall in wilder areas-- but most of them are outside the city. Or you have to be in the Forbidden City on a cold, rainy day or at the peak of a media-orchestrated flu epidemic, when the crowds are away. Even then, you will have to close your eyes often in order not to see all the jarring details I mentioned before.   You may appreciate the cheap food. The poor will still smile at you and greet you (while the new middle-class rich won't even look at you). The huge parks provide a welcome respite from the ugliness and noise of the rest of the city, but they are quite ordinary and, like the whole place, not genuinely Chinese, but a sloppy mixture of styles. Even here, under the shadow of gracious willows, your contemplation of the beautiful lotus ponds will often be interrupted by the awful noise of spitting indigenous males clearing their throats. This is China!  Remember the white tags of censorship in the book. And know that contrary to what the cover photograph wants you to believe, very few young people in Peking practice kungfu. These days they prefer to play basket-ball. electronic games.    PS: Read the "Ugly Chinaman" by Boyang to understand why this country has become such a mess.     
 Hey, look at my review title, I'm playing the historical race card too! Before we compare our pesky scorned eurocentric models and archetypes to Afrocentric 'black/negroid' models and archetypes, let us look at the basic 'historical/cultural' facts. First, the Egyptians, Phoenicians and Carthaginians which inhabitated the northern fringe of Africa and Asia, and did influence the Hellenes,  were Semitic/Hamitic peoples....NOT negroid....Eventually the black Nubians did rule over a later Ancient Egypt for a time, but this was past the cultural mingling  stages between the Hamitic Egyptians and the Ancient Hellenes.  Minoan Crete knew of the Egyptians. Crete never depicted the Egyptians with black/negroid features. If anything, they bore a slight resemblance to the Minoans.  This guy's farfetched theories do not add up, they are riddled with obvious contradictions and totally bogus assumptions.  Athena is Semitic before she is black. Though she had braided hair in some depictions, she was not dark in complexion or ample in the facial features. A straight nose, not a wide nose.  Better yet she was neither Semitic, or black...but Greek. Seeing it is the Ancient Greeks who worshipped her....NOT the Semites or blacks.            
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I don't believe that all of these people giving such rave reviews of this book have really used it for long. I also would tend to rate it very highly, except that there is a glaring typo, like the entire description, of hexagram #15. I used to have a copy of this book, and used it, and for the most part loved it, but I find it difficult to believe that an author of any integrity would not have done a revision by now, and corrected the error.  If that was done, I would happily buy and use another copy of this boo 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 This book is erroneous from it's core, because it is really discussing the determination of biological sex of a child, NOT the gender. 
 This is going to short, but I found the play below standards set by the author.  There is weak imagery combined by poor, ineffective dialogue, yet there are nice character settings. There is a nice story line combining  fire and passion in Leonardo's case with love for the bride, yet it is let  down by the poor use of language.  It is good for reading before bed, but  other than that, I'd say "NO", like the "Just Say NO"  drug ads 
 I used to think he was great, till I caught the Director's Cut of 'Das Boot.'  All of a sudden you're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn't in the original, and the spell is broken.  Let's not even talk about 'Air Force One.'  Now I've seen 'The Perfect Storm' twice, and I own the book, but I still haven't read it because I'm reasonably sure the book MUST suck if the movie is this bad.  And I'm sorry New England, but what are Gloucestermen anyways, except for great rapers of the high seas?  What will they NOT do for a buck, you might ask.  Ok, they are not as bad as the Japanese, but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there's no tomorrow.  Watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu.  Sure you will find excitement aplenty, amped up to eleven.  Even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history.  I even like some of the principal actors, but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be.  This just doesn't stand up to repeat viewings.  Unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker.  Do you 
 Somebody put together curves and equations from other books to make quick money. You will be disapointed. don't buy it  
 Trust me, don't waste your money with this thing! I researched and shopped around for such an item and made the mistake of thinking this was good. Well, here's why it isn't:  * The pump gets clogged repeatedly, every few days or so, and it's a pain to clean.  * The filters don't last very long and the material of which they're made begins to "shed," so to speak, thereby falling apart enough to have their fibers in the water.  * The pump doesn't last long, period. I'm on my second pump--the first one lasted only a couple months--which itself now crapped out after a month.  * Mold will build up inside the unit very quickly.  * If the water level gets too low, it becomes noisy.  Believe me, you'll love this at first but get very frustrated with it soon enough. 
 The book is made to sound as if it would be all you need to become a Medical Billing/Health Insurance specialist.  Not a chance.  You will need the most current coding manuals to even attempt to complete this course.  And even then without the answers you have no way to check your progress.  There must be better books, Keep Searching

 From its boring title to its cast of cliched southern rednecks, the Empty Chair disappoints from the very beginning.  The storyline about a teen killer/kidnapper obsessed with insects is interesting, but the story quickly dissolves into a half-baked tale of southern intrigue that never offers any excitement.  Deaver tried to save the book by pulling about a dozen rabbits out of a hat near the end of the novel, but many of these surprises and plot twists make no sense at all, and after the third or fourth one, the reader just gets tired of the whole thing.  Deaver also tries to wrap up every plot conflict with a neat little bow at the end, but he leaves out most of the explanations which only leaves readers scratching their heads and wondering what happened.  Try the earlier books in this series, both of which were far better reads 
 A good story with strong characters lures the reader's imagination, inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next.  This is not one of those stories.  It's not a bad book by any means.  Shining moments appear.  However, Taita is a character hard with which to sympathize.  All the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light, and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity.  Did I mention it's predictable?  You should have expected that.  Pick up a Clavell or Jennings instead.  This is Soap Opera history 
 Maybe films should be made by film makers 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 Come on.  This is a book by Jim Belushi.  Need I say more 
 I have lived in and travelled to Cuba several times over the past 45 years.  The author presents descriptions of Cuba: collapsing buildings, cockroaches, hunger, the young wishing to flee, her lover's father imprisioned and yet, never once does she ask or wonder why people are so poor and desperate.  How the author can be so oblivious to the suffering all around her and its causes (lack of human rights, due process, freedom of the press, freedom to associate, freedom to think) is sad, even pathetic.  So you have to wonder how Alfredo, the author's boyfriend, could love her unless he is a necrophiliac.  She must be dead from the neck up.   In the book, she menations an American who is looking for weed.  The American tells her that she acts normally how he acts when he is stoned.  How fitting.  I couldn't bear reading past the first 100 pages.  The crime is that trees were cut down to print this drivel.   
 This book can be a light read to occupy an hour on the plane. I kind of expected some miraculuous book after reading reviews like: "Wow it changed my life" or "I wish I knew this stuff  10 years ago". In my opinion, most of the stuff explained is pretty obvious. A lot of the stuff is absurd. There are some good tips but they're few. For example, some topics or advice:  "How do determine the gender of your date?" Doh!! "How to escape from a bad date" comes down to do a major dress and makeup overhaul in the washroom or break the washroom window and run away. And has picture of a man doing that. Come on! What kind of woman can scare the hell out of a guy that he wants to break a window in a washroom and run? "How to survive credit card decline" advises you and your date to wash dishes in the restaurant to pay for your meal or teaches how to run away quick "How to make love in an elevator" comes down to two things:  1. Stop the elevator 2. Make love really fast.... Very insightful  How to fake orgasm and how to stop the wedding are fascinating reads. What to do if you wake up in a bed with a person whose name you don't remember gives a positive and refreshing attitude and a bunch of suggestions where to look for a name tag :)  There is some potentially useful stuff how to fight your body odour, bad  breath, etc. But if you know you have this problem it's easy to find the right solution against your particular problem on the net.  Overall, there is not much worth keeping in memory besides your common sense. Unless you're a virgin who does not know how to remove woman's bra or an idiot who does not know that if you cheat you should take every possible precaution 
 Poor casting, poor acting, unconvincing characters. The leading lady had no energy. There was no excitement, sexual or otherwise. Boring. One of King's worst. In contrast, I found King's "Swimming Naked" (Red Shoe Diaries) to be enjoyable. The acting wasn't great, but the stories were mildly entertaining and the nude scenes very pleasant 
 Considering the size of the book I was disappointed in the lack of information and meanings given. They are mostly one word meanings, if there is a meaning at all. Mostly it seems like it wants to take you in a big circle of reference from one name to the next never quite giving you what you are looking for. It wasn't helpful for me. I found "The Babyname Wizard" book A LOT more informative and helpful 
 People wrote books like this about the "mysteries" of invention decades ago, without shedding any more light on the process than Schwartz's lightweight contribution to the genre. Only recently have inventors and engineers in the West learned of Genrich Altshuller's Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (which also goes by the Russian acronym TRIZ), based on an intensive study of the principles implicit in mainly Soviet-era patents, though also incorporating information from patents in other countries. TRIZ shows how the haphazard "methods" traditionally used by inventors waste time and resources, whereas the algorithm developed by Altshuller and his colleagues parses away the irrelevant information and identifies the exact "technical contradiction" the inventor has to resolve, along with a matrix of techniques for tackling it.   Yet neither Schwartz nor the American inventors he interviewed in his book reveal an awareness of Altshuller's revolutionary discoveries. "Juice" comes across to me like a popular physics book published in the early 21st Century that shows a complete ignorance of developments in 20th Century physics like quantum mechanics and general relativity. Borrow it from the library, if you must read it, but don't waste your money otherwise 
 No color pictures, it has black/white "drawn" pictures, but the information about each plant has a lot of detail 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 I bought this for the Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy documentaries, like I imagine you might. I'm not disappointed really, I don't regret buying it in any sense, it's just that this DVD isn't very good at all. It doesn't attempt to make any insight, which isn't something I particularly care for anyway. What each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers. I can't imagine anyone learning something they didn't already know from them. It's mostly told through pictures when it seems there's option to use video. The Dahmer documentary, made in 1993, doesn't feature anything of interest. There's no interview with his father or anything, just a voice telling a story over pictures we've all seen before, with occassional clips of victims' families in court. The Gacy one, made in '96, is the same. There's also a program, made in 1997,on criminal profiling. This look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling. It's told often with video rather then photos, which is good, but still they're somewhat boring subjects. The Criminal Profiler, Dahmer, and Gacy are all episodes from the A&E series Investigative Reports, if you didn't realise. The last program is on Charles Manson. It's quite different from the others on the disc. Made in 1997, it originally aired on television as Biography: Charles Manson: Journey Into Evil. I don't with have any interest in Manson, but I guess it's ok. It features significant interviews with Manson and main female members of the Family. All programs run for about one hour or more. I wouldn't reccomend any of them, none are good at all. I might even describe them as terrible, considering what else is out there 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 I had a lot of high hopes for this book.  Sirona Knight has obvious experience with magic, and talent with the pen.  Dream Magic starts out weakly, yet another book that feels the need to defend itself in the first few chapters.  (The usual, and far too often repeated magic isn't Satanism, Some Christians aren't that understanding...blah blah blah.)  Then I started to really enjoy myself while working through her versions of quarter calling, circle castings, and astral meditations.  However, I expected her to go into more advanced studies...or further details and she never did.  The start of what could be an awesome book drops off into a number of love and wealth spells.  What a let down 
 I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift, but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store, and it's not even worth the dollar.     Very cheezy item.   
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I have read books about the Kennedy family since I was a child, and I am familiar with a lot of the historical incidents.  Some of the book was not historically accurate - I don't  believe Jackie was at the funeral of Patrick, and the author skipped her  job at Viking Press.  Also, the writing was choppy, and the chapters seemed  to end abruptly.  In fact, the book ended with her death, and it seems as  if he forgot to finish it.  The book appeared to be written in a hurry,  with very little continuity or accuracy.  I was very disappointed that I  wasted my time reading this book 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.

 It's a good book it just askes me as a student to assume too much.  Some of the problems at the end of the chapters are incomplete.  If i was to go about my life as a ME assuming random stuff i would get sued to a point of non-existance.  This book does not teach good engineering practices 
 This is absolutely no improvement on the poor VHS video tape.  A travesty.  I subtract all stars for the terrible transfer, menu, and options.  
 The reference to craft "superstars" should have warned me off. The lowly T-shirt shows up as a placemat, a lampshade, a car-lot hanging banner, cafï¿½ curtains, and a rug - oh yeah, and a couple of overworked wearables, too. Tricky projects show off the wit of their too-cool creators rather than enrich the lives of DIY readers.Who needs it? 
 "Complete reference" - I thought this would describe/explain the SQL code that I need to use in my job.  This book sits on my desk at work - for SQL code, I get it from the internet 
  How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.  Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities." How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." (p. 147). He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.   Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:  Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.  I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?  Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.     
 What was once an indispensable guide to US politics has been steadily ruined over the years by the shrill, sanctimonious editorializing of Michael Barone.  I used to by new editions of this series every two years but quit several years ago because I was getting less information and more op-ed preaching.  I did pick up a copy of this edition at a local book store and spent a great deal of time flipping thorough it and saw that little has changed.  Barone is simply a blind apologists for the Bush administration and contemptuously dismisses anyone who does not subscribe to his philosophy as merely being a part of the "feminist left."  It is such a shame, as a lot of the information in here is valuable to someone with an interest in US politics and elections.  It is too bad Barone's ego has gotten in the way and ruined a once great series 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 i've come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse. the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface, and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser won't track right. i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didn't test it well enough. unless your willing to do that skip this one, it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice. i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul. but then again you do get what you pay for : 
 I got two problems with this here lingeree: 1. That model at the top of the page is sparkin hot, how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend?  EH?  False advertizing if ya ask me.  Their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does. Or a warnin label "Objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear." 2.  I paid $14.95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on. My suggestion: go for the crotchless OR the bustless OR the fishnet, but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend.. 
 I agree with one of the other reviewers who found this biographer cold and unsympathetic. I'd go further and say this is the worst type of academic writing; a lot of facts and documentation are brought out, but the writer simply isn't talented enough to give it vitality. Instead of attempting some sort of personel interpretation of Zelda's life, Milford gives us overlong plot summaries of Zelda's fiction. No analysis! Just the facts! She treats the deaths of both the Fitzgeralds with the compassion of a coroner. People with Nancy Milford's limited abilities shouldn't be writing biograpies. The reader is given a depressing work on a talented artist, and  wounded soul, that passes on no understanding, no sympathy, and no appreciation. How horribly bleak. 
 I think I'm done with the Mrs. Murphy books.  This one was so bad I couldn't even finish it.  I actually threw it away.  It's time for the author to move on.  These characters have become downright boring 
 The title of this book is a misnomer as there is very little about the making of the hydrogen bomb in it. I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed in a book. There are hundreds of pages spent detailing the Soviet spy program during WWII while the USA was trying to build the atomic bomb. The scientists and their contacts and where they met and what they said to each other and what the Soviet scientists did with the information and on and on in mind-numbing minutiae. This information is all well and good, but that's not why I bought the book. The hydrogen bomb isn't touched on for 350 or 400 pages and then it still seems to spend more time on the Soviets and their attempts to catch up to the American program.  The writing is fine, if not stimulating, it just seems to be off track most of the time. I wanted to read about Teller, Oppenheimer, Ulam, Feynman and all the rest and their conversations, disagreements, failures and ultimate successes in creating the hydrogen bomb. What I got was a heavy dose of Klaus Fuchs and the rest who stole every item they could and sold it to the Russians. This is an important story, but it's not the one I wanted to read about and not the story the book purported to tell 
 ridicolous creatureattaks a bar full of strange characters.it starts out pretty good whith the introductions of the characters but goes own hill fast when it bings nothing new just more gore.Krista allen however is always great to look at and she does not dissapoint in feast eighter,if only there was more of her to look at,that would have helped the movie a lot.ps does any one else think baltazar ghetty is a illigitamate son of martin sheen.Because he looks like two drops of water like charlie sheen in everything he does 
 I thought this was very cute and my daughter loved playing with it.  Then, when she was in her carseat she threw up, which is very unusual for her. Then I figured out what happened:  Right after, I noticed that she was sticking the keys all the way into her throat.  I'm sure she gagged on it and that is why she threw up.  I now let her play with it a little, but only if I am watching her closely to make sure she doesn't do that.  I wouldn't recommend it. 
 This is just a poor, poor album.  Jerry Garcia is the most overrated singer in all of Rock 'n' Roll.  Try "Stage Fright" by THE BAND instead

 I was totally disappointed with this "self help" book.  Nothing concrete, just concepts.  Very little information I was able to use.  Fluff piece 
 Very dramatic music - felt like a battle.  Not an easy listening type of music by any stretch of the imagination 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 A neighbor gave me this book to read.  I have read the DaVinci Code and I thought it was good fiction mixed with some fact.  Of Course Dan Brown strings together many unrelated truths half truths and fabrications to make his story interesting, so it is quite easy to write an expose showing where he stepped over the line.  This critique of The DaVinci Code goes too far the other way trying to spin "Orthodox" Christianity as the only true religion and the "Orthodox" point of view the only "true" history of the last 2000 years.  The authors have dumbed down the subject matter, omitted information and scholarship contrary to their point of view, and created a book that borders on propaganda.  One part of the book that I found very annoying was the failure to address the historical excesses of institutional or "Orthodox" Christianity.  The Authors criticise Brown for writing that the Church (both Catholic and Protestant) Burned or otherwise murdered "Millions" of heretics.  The authors concede that the number is closer to 50 or 60 thousand.  So which is worse?  Making a mistake concerning the number of heretics murdered?  Or defending the institution that actually murdered thousands of people?  (And I would assume if we add in the Crusades both against the Muslims and the "heretics" we'd probably get a lot closer to the million than thousand figure.)  Another spin made by the authors actually caused me to laugh out loud.  You should read how these "Orthodox" scholars are spinning the female responsibility for the fall/oppression of females nexus.  Here's what they say.  The original sin in the Bible was Adam not working hard enough to spiritually protect his family.  This is a very "unorthodox" and "unbiblical spin designed to distract you from the fact that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have for centuries oppressed women because Eve ate the Fruit First.  What does Brother Paul say about it     11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.  12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp* authority over the man, but to be in silence*.  13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  15 Notwithstanding she* shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety   I think Paul would be very angry reading the Author's attempt to put a "new age" spin the scripture to fit a more modern interpretation of the story.  This spin also flies in the face of Christian History.  And I do not feel any better about it even though the Authors point out that pagan cultures have abused women as well.  So what?  Do two wrongs make a right? If Orthodox Christianity is "true" why did it take the institution almost 2000 years to figure out that men and women were equal and figure out that the story in Genesis and Paul's exposition of it were wrong?   Ultimately this book fails because it is plain dishonest.  Yes it points out some issues where Dan Brown obviously inflates the truth, or even creates it out of nothing.  Brown's book has historical errors and it does have a point of view and an agenda.  However, this does not excuse the propaganda and misdirection contained in "Cracking Da Vinci's Code." 
  My three favorite films from 2004, "Sideways", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", and "Before Sunset" have a lot in common; they all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances.   There are more similarities in three my favorite films - they all have characters I liked, I care about; often, weak and certainly not perfect; sometimes, confused and immature but sympathetic, and real.   This is not the case with "Closer". My problem is that none of its four main characters was at least slightly interesting, appealing, likable or just realistic. And it is not the biggest problem that they were not likable - I can live with that and still love and enjoy the film. Examples - Nichols's own fascinating debut, "Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf". George and Martha (Liz Taylor and Richard Burton) were a couple from hell but like a theme song in "Closer" goes, "I could not take my eyes off them". I still remember Taylor saying in the end of the film, "George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad" and it was sad. I'd learned something about the characters that were deep and complex, troubled and disturbed. They were persons, the human beings, not the caricatures. Another example, Ingmar Bergman's "Scenes from the marriage":  "Bergman and his leading actors Liv Ullmann and Arland Josephson give one of the most truthful, honest, heartbreaking and credible portraits of a couple, one of the most intense character studies ever done on film. For five hours, we share twenty years from the lives of Johan and Marianne as well as their love, hate, misunderstandings, insecurities, anger, jealousy, denial, sadness, pain, despair, and loss. We witness the moments of incredible tenderness and unexpected and shocking violence, both physical and mental. There are no depth that they have not descended in the search of themselves and the meaning of their relationship."  As far as a film about the selfish, self-obsessed, unsympathetic characters goes, "Faithless", directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Ingmar Bergman could be the most similar in its theme to "Closer" and they both have almost identical twist plot toward the end. The difference is huge, though. "Faithless" has a high and unbearable tragedy that characters brought upon themselves, "Closer" is smug, full of itself and tries to hide its emptiness behind often disgusting and unnecessary dirty language. Did I learn something about four beautiful people in "Closer"? Sure. Dan's sperm tastes like Larry's but sweeter; Alice's c*** tastes like heaven, and Anna does not kiss strange men and does not understand why sex is so important. I don't want to get closer to learn all this; instead, I'd like to respond like Helen Sinclair, "No, no, don't speak. Don't speak. Please don't speak. Please don't speak. No. No. No. Go. Go... Don't speak."  Enormously talented and famous (and rightly so) Mike Nichols made an elegantly looking, well acted (Natalie Portman and Clive Owen are very good) and quite amusing film which is a screen adaptation of a popular play of the same title. Popular or not, the play was not a great work of writing and its problems are very obvious after adaptation to the big screen.   2.5/5  
 This book is written relatively well.  But, as other reviewers points out, if you really want to understand the arguments, then you had better realize Eugenie Scott is a staunch defender evolution and always has been.  In other words, there is no way she could have, and did not, write a balanced treatment of the debate at all.  It's balanced for evolutionists, to be sure, not for anyone else and obviously not for me.  I am still waiting for anyone, anyone at all, to go into enough detail about the fossil record (there are a number of possibilities here) to actually prove that there are enough fossils, that the dating of them was accurate, there was no 'fudging', and many more details about the fossils themselves and the techniques used to analyze them - to show that evolution is a fact.  If, for example, we somehow fossilized 100 different birds that are alive today, some related and some not, I have a feeling that evolution would still be prescribed as the cause for the different species, that different dates would be assigned for each species based on what type of rock it was found (even though it has nothing to do with anything in this case), etc.  The negative reviews of those who critize this book are based purely on emotion.  None of them involve science, which is supposedly what evolution is based on.  If anyone can tell me how specific traits of evolution are testable, such as the 'fact' that life began from inanimate matter, or that species evolved into separate species, I would love to hear it.  Please be specific and let me know how you know based on your five senses, and not that there's a magical theory that explains it, because just as creationism explains everything - so does evolution.  Both are not true.  I am truly amazed that Amazon.com doesn't delete most of the 'reviews' because they are nothing but a bunch of cheap shots at the other side 
 The songs on the CD are great.  Jane Monheit has a beautiful voice and she performs several christmas classics well.  This "enhanced" version is horrible however.  Sony has "enhanced" this version of the CD so that you cannot import the music into iTunes and then subsequently play it in your iPod.  You can only use it in Sony digital players 
 As someone who studied meta-mathematics at Caltech and UCLA, I found this book disappointing-stylistically, mathematically and philosophically. To paraphrase the physicist Pauli, this isn't right; this isn't even wrong. This well-meaning man's editors should do a little bit of legwork before reprinting a man's inflated self-appraisal. I am so disappointed in this book that I am seriously considering returning it for a refund.   I guess I should blame myself. My first response to the editorial comment naming the author as the intellectual heir to Gdel and Turing was, "Gregory who?" Shelah, Solovay, Martin: these are names I know, but who is Gregory Chaitin? I should have gone with my gut. In retrospect, it is telling that all the jacket quotes are from freewheeling authors of popularizations, not from respected philosophers, logicians, or scientists.  The entire book is written in an embarrassingly gushing, adolescent style full of boldface and exclamation points. I know that the author was trying to write an enthusiastic, accessible book of philosophical and methodological advocacy, but this doesn't excuse shoddy editorial craftsmanship.   Don't take my word for it. Let the author speak for himself. From page 7, "Gdel's 1931 work on incompleteness, Turing's 1936 work on uncomputability, and my own work on the role of information, randomness and complexity have shown increasingly emphatically that the role that Hilbert envisioned for formalism in mathematics is best served by computer programming languages[.]"   Imagine if a working composer wrote, "Bach's preludes and fugues, Beethoven's symphonies, and my own string quartets have shown increasingly emphatically..." This man's reputation in his declared field is nowhere near his apparent stature in his own mind. The ideas discussed in this book are worthy of late-night musings over a nice brandy, or maybe a Scientific American article, but only after extensive revision. They are not ready for publication in a monograph.  From pages 148-149, "This book is full of amazing case studies of new, unexpected math ideas that reduced the complicated to the obvious. And I've come up with a few of these ideas myself. How does it feel to do that? [...] You have to be seized by a demon, and our society doesn't want too many people to be like that! [...] In fact, I only really feel alive when I'm working on a new idea, when I'm making love to a woman (which is also working on a new idea, the child we might conceive) or when I'm going up a mountain! It's intense, very intense. [...] I push everything else away. [...] I don't pay the bills. [...] And you can't force yourself to do it, any more than a man can force himself to make love to a woman he doesn't want. [...] People may think that something's wrong with me, but I'm okay, I'm more than okay."  And there you have it. I was hoping for a book to catch me up on some of the recent advances in meta-mathematics and how these ideas bear on science and philosophy. For a far better viewpoint on how information science influences modern physics, check out Charles Seife, Decoding the Universe. 
 I have been reading Danielle Steel for a long time, and it seems to me lately I can guess the plot and the ending long before I get there.  Her books are starting to copy themselves, same thing different setting.  I really had a hard time getting through this one because she kept repeating herself when talking about Sasha's feelings, the book could've been a lot shorter if she didn't write the same thing over and over.  I would not recommend this one 
 In this book, the lives of four people intersect and are woven together.  The initial descriptions of the four people--two recently released convicts, a woman whose husband has committed suicide, and a police officer--are interesting and promise an intriguing story.  Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from there.  The characters are manipulated in an artificial manner, and the interactions are forced and wooden.  I agree that the writing is surprisingly amateurish at times and a good editor would have caught the awkward phrasing and helped improve it.  This is not Danielle Steele's best work 
 What a big, big, big disappointment!  I purchased this book and it is just a collection of old materials by Mr. Pyzdek in a new packaging that has a six sigma theme.  This book adds very little to the understanding of the six sigma methodolgy of business and quality improvement.  If you have Tom's old exam refresher books then you have everything that this handbook offers - except for the cover.  I wish I could get my $100.00 back???? 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 I wouldn't bother spending money on this book. It reads too much like a brochure. The author spent the majority of her time talking about the Innkeepers and not the Inns. Not only that, but she didn't rate the Inns,  so it was hard to tell which Inns were good and which were bad. I wound up  returning this book and purchasing "The Unofficial Guide to Bed and  Breakfasts in New England" by Lea Lane. It's a much better book. The  author visited each Inn personally and then gave a thorough review. She  also rated the Inns.  She did not accept any payment from the Inns for  inclusion in the book which meant she was able to write an unbiased review 
 I read the reviews but, because Amazon has been so reliable over the years, decided to order the red casseroles anyway.  My order arrived today and much to my displeasure, I also received the white casseroles!  They're being returned tomorrow and I'm asking for a refund.  I do not want to take the chance of receiving another incorrect order.  My advice is do NOT order this casserole! 
 I agree this book is definitely one sided and skewed. Mussolini was not a saint, however this book fails to mention any other aspect of his life, other than that of disturbed Hitler sidekick. The fact remains that Benito Mussolini was a leader in his own right. Many other biographies show his ability to make people have pride, and the 'mighty' Adolph Hitler twitch. look elsewhere for facts 
 This book is not appropriate for children who are too young to separate fantasy from fact.  It contains images of danger and death and the main character, Jemima, is portrayed as inept and stupid.  I realize that millions of kids have enjoyed this book over the years, but my child will have to wait until she's old enough to understand these concepts and not be frightened by them 
 The quality of all the movies is poor-comparable to or worst than VCD. I watched the first 2 dices and lost interest in the rest of the movies. It is more worthy to buy 1 good DVD movie than 50 lousy poor quality classic.  
 This is from a great hardcopy textbook but it is probably the worst CD textbook I have ever seen in terms of being difficult to use. Only runs under Netscape and self-configures only with older versions of netscape. Will not really run under mac OSX unless you spend hours setting up a "pseudonetwork" on your computer desktop. They should not be selling this outdated "dinosaur" CD from 2001. Buy it if you want to waste a lot of your time and end up with a very very klutzy interface. Publisher Saunders should rerelease with a modern interface, or transfer it to different CD publisher. Project leader at W.B. Saunders for this CD should be FIRED!!! or at least seriously demoted or made to listen to Lawrence Welk 
 We had grandma purchase these for the kids after they were featured in one of my parenting magazines before Christmas.  It looked like a great bath toy and the kids love bubbles.  What a total disappointment!  We've tried all the different soaps and even emailed the company that makes it because I was sure there must be a piece missing.  Thats how few bubbles the thing produces.  International Playthings responded that we need to keep the cup submerged in the water but not the handle for it to work; that doesn't work either, I tried it with 3 different soaps that way.  Now I have to get the order number from my mother-in-law and try to return these - what a hassle on top of being a poor toy 
 The Fridays gang steals some diamonds.  Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be.  His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve.  Plus, everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that I don't know where to begin.  Whatever you do don't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on TBS or something 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 This book fails both as a history or analysis of Yugoslav politics or as a critical biography of Tito. The first few chapters, which contain an overly compressed "historical" review of the South Slavs from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century, contain factual, spelling and interpretative errors so obtrusive and atrocious that they are almost laughable. For example, West claims that the leader of the 1573 Croat peasant revolt was "Donja Stubica" - that was actually the name of the village in which it started. He claims that in 1871 the Croat revolutionary Eugen Kvaternik led an "armed assault on the Serbs," when in fact Kvaternik launched a foolishly bold uprising against the Habsburg Monarchy while many of his fellow rebels were themselves Serbs. He persistently misspells the surname of the great Serbian linguist and writer Vuk Karadzic as `Karadjic' - and there are literally dozens of similar mistakes that riddle the entire text. West basically argues that the problems in Yugoslavia are directly tied to historical events and religious schisms that occurred during the Middle Ages, and reduces the wars which ensued after Yugoslavia's collapse to religious conflicts. He also insists that there are no national nor even ethnic differences between the Serbs, Croats or Bosnian Muslims; rather, he says they are all the same ethnic group with three different religions, thus demonstrating his glaring ignorance of the differences between `nation' and `ethnicity,' among other things. He focuses extensive attention and invective, perhaps rightfully, to the WW2 Croatian Ustasha regime and the often scurrilous role of the Croatian Catholic Church during this period. On the other hand, he downplays or denies the much less extensive but often quite brutal crimes of the Serbian Chetniks during the same period - even to the point of making the ludicrous claim that the Serbian Orthodox Church was "never clearly associated with Great Serb nationalism or with the Chetniks." One of the main flaws of this book is that its primary focus is on World War II - the implication being that this period crucially influenced events in the 1990s. This is only true to a certain extent, but oversimplifies and greatly downplays the even more vital 40+ ensuing years. In fact, at times this book rather eerily resembles texts often seen in Croatian and Serbian newspapers during the late 1980s and early 1990s which speak of events from 50, 150 or even 500 years ago as though they happened yesterday. West's ignorance and lack of objectivity also leads him to (rather outrageously) twice refer to the Kosovo Albanians as `Shiptars' - among non-Albanians, this is a racial epithet, not a neutral descriptive term. Tito, the central figure in this book, fares little better. Although West has a nostalgically favorable view of Tito, he offers no new insights into Yugoslavia's long-time president and strongman, only the reworded observations and conclusions from other biographies, memoirs and histories, both favorable and critical. Often he provides details on completely trivial matters from Tito's life, at one point even citing actor Richard Burton's impressions of Tito and his wife. Aside from a few mildly engaging anecdotes taken from his own travels in Yugoslavia, there is little of interest here. Reading West's book is a colossal waste of time; my recommendation is for readers to check it out of a library, peruse the photographs and then go straight to the bibliography to find more worthwhile books to read on Tito, WW2 and the Ustasha terror and the former Yugoslavia in general 
 Probably some well to do, gated, white neighborhood populated with yuppies and BMWs 
 I was disapointed, it was not what I thought it would be.  It's rap and I expected it to be like what was featured in Kill Bill  
 How can so many people rate this movie a high star?!?   It overused the same ghostly scenes from the Grudge and it was extremly predictable. You already know how it will end when you watch the first twenty minutes of it.   I mean, it showed the same house that was "burned down" in part one, and had the same effect as it: people visit the house, then they are cursed. Nothing can beat the original. nothing. You are wasting your time with this movie, seriously.   If you did not think this was a bad movie then answer this one question: why was that man eating breakfast at the table killed, along with the others when they never visited the house AND (mind you) they were in CHICAGO, not JAPAN?!?!?!?! wow, do NOT rent this junk. 
 The product was not quite what I expected, but I got a quick return to my satisfaction.  Happy shopping 
 Terrible sound, boring.... worst classical CD I have ever listed to. I highly recommend Mozart: Requiem 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I bought this book, thinking the same as another reviewer, that it would be about DETAILS, not basic stuff.  I was extremely disappointed.  This is good for high school students or a high school guidance office, but it's not useful for someone who is starting out of college with a professional career.  A MUCH better choice would be The New Women's Dress For Success, by Molloy.  This book was extremely thin, 64 pages, and overpriced.  I paid much less for a different book that was MUCH more informative and helpful 
 My review reflects the summary I gave. Cozzens is a racial, nationalistic, religious bigot.  He is a smug, pretentious writer. He does not improve with age.  Book is worthless 
 I have purchased the pv-gs65 and everytime I use the camera with autofocus it makes everything blurry and only stays in focus for about 3 seconds.  I returned my camcorder and got another one (pvgs65) and I am still having this problem.  everytime i have used the camera i have to use manual focus.  If anyone else has had this problem or knows how i could get this fixed please email me or post another review.             brandonwg8677@comcast.net                                    Thank You 
 It is a great concept, but mine kept filling with water and then getting an error so my cats never had a chance to use it.  I tried all of the stuff to get the errors to stop but i never had it go a whole cycle without getting an error.  I would definately be worth the money if it would work correctly 
 If amazon had indicated that this was a docu-DVD I would not have purchased it!  One does not really get to see the artist performing except for clips from here and there.  The remaining band members tell their history from how they got their name and when and how Janis joined the Holding Company, interesting but to much talking and to little music!  Unless you are into documentaries - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD 
 Seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that James Frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as Billy Crystal.  But then they can only put out the cotton-candy Coney Island fluff as '700 Sundays' is.    Granted, the book is based on Crystal's highly-praised Tony Award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  But it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night Kaddish.  Yet in ripping a page out of Billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  It probably went something like:   "Hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 Sundays with your pop?"  "Well, I'm not a writer per se.  I just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage."  "So here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have."  "It'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads."  "Don't worry, bubby, I know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  Here's their recipe: They'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.  'How?' may you ask!  Well, they'll cut `em in half, then cut `em in half again.  And using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- Slap it all together between two hardcovers...It'll be just fine."  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry.  Consider it like a vintage bottle of Mogen David 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout.  In this case, the local bookstores.  Oh, and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more.  People'll drink it up."  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry, Face.  Everybody loves ya.  Just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about Satchmo and Mantle, you'll be all right.  Don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. Y'know `700 Mondays;' then `700 Tuesdays' and so on.  Yes'sir, I can see it all now:  We've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick.  Oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too, starting with `700 Hanukkahs!'  "You're still friends with that kid, Adam Sandler, back from your SNL days, aren't ya?!  Yes, so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that Hanukkah song of his.  It'll be a great collaboration.  It's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. Y'know God blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do.  Yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 Passovers!'  "And it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha know.  Just think, when people see Chuck Heston...may God keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see Chuck Heston and The Ten Commandments, they'll be thinking about you too, Billy.  Yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on Passover, you'll see.  "Oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal we'll get `700 Yom Kippurs!'   You'll see.  But this will be only for our people, Billy, you understand.  So you might have to dig deep to get material for it.  But that's what authors do, they dig deep.  But you already knew that, right?  Can you dig it, man?  I knew that you could.  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry, Face, everybody loves ya!  Your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that.  But hey listen, with a book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal, we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets.  Mark my words we will.   "And say, since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get Martin Scorsese to produce and direct your life story.  Yes, it'll be something like 'Pinch Me I'm Still Jewish: The Billy Crystal Story' in widescreen and all that jazz.  It's what everybody in Hollywood's doing right now.  Yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead already, Billy - God forbid.  No, siree, bubby!!    "So Scorsese will do the movie on the cheap, because God knows the man deserves an Oscar already.  You know it, I know it, we all know it, Billy.  And not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the really big one, see!  And just imagine, wouldn't it be something if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed Marty his own Oscar?!  Yes, well, we can schmooze on about all this stuff later.  "But for now, with the books and everything, you'll be a one-man franchise, yes you will!  You'll be on the New York Times Best Seller List from now until forever!  It'll be great!!"  "Yes, but..."  "Oh and well, I didn't want to say anything just yet, but, okay, here goes: There might be plans to expand everything too!  Listen, bubby, I know somebody who knows somebody who...you get the idea...over at the networks.    "We can do a little Chris Rock in the neighborhood sort of thing.  We'll put a kid who looks and acts like you - about as tall as you - into the neighborhood that you and your family lived in, see.    "And it's going to be a period piece too!  We'll introduce all the new kids to the stars of yesteryear -- y'know, Cantor, Jolson, Jessel, Durante!  Throw in some goniffs and shiksas that the cast can work off of every week -- It'll be fun!    "Chris Rock is great.  But you can be greater too.  Listen, Face, we'll make it a celebration.  Something like 'Growing up Mazel Tov!'  Maybe we get 700 shows out of it.  Maybe less, maybe more, but people will still love it anyway.  You'll see!"  "Yes, but, well, I'm not really a writer/author.  I'm an entertainer, so why would I want to do any of this?"  "We could make a couple of dollars!"  "Okay. I'm in!"  And so it went and so it goes.  Final analysis: A So Not Looking Mahvelous, Better Luck Next Time, With All Due Respect, Sadly Not Recommended Book.   
 My Cyberhome portable DVD player worked for all of 1 day. It is unable to play DVDs or CDs of any type. Also, if you charge the battery according to manufacturer specs, it will completely drain out within 24 hours.   I attempted to get service from Cyberhome to no avail even though product is still under warranty. Their support number is unreachable as is their support email address. Attempts to locate the company via the web were unsuccessful.   This would have been a great product at a great price if only it had worked.  Purchase at you own risk. Check out the manufacturer web site. You have been warned 
 You don't need this book. The Equus comes with the codes on a CD 
 Basic Instinct was a pretty good movie.  Basic Instinct 2, not so good.  But Sharon Stone is still HOT!  It is worth buying the movie just to see her 
 I've tried many of the Yogi teas, and I really don't like the taste of this one.  I recommend the Rejuvination tea - it is a green tea that also fights free radicals and aging, but it has a much smoother taste 
 The book provides believable and sometimes fascinating information, and the author is to be commended for getting this hard-sell published. But the writing is stilted and surprisingly flat considering the writer is a professional music journalist with a growing list of book credits.   If the reader is looking for evangelical fervor - and a writing style that can inspire - they will not find it here.   As is always advisable to those who do seek to turn someone on to music - give that person the music of Big Star. Don't give them this book. 
 I got this device to help me clean around my place.  I thought it would be easy to use, and it is  not.  The pads do not stay on.  When you are trying to put them on, the solution leaks all over you.  After working on my shower, I saw no difference.  I wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth. 
 Sorry Guys for a old Classic Rocker like me I coundn't take this.!. That Singer is mostly likely the worst I have ever heard. I would rather puncture my eardrums then ever listen to this again! 
 If this movie was ever going to have a chance, it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can't be dealt with that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely. There just wasn't time enough, I guess, to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you've read the book, skip the movie, but if you saw the movie, you should do yourself a favor and get the book 
 I previously wrote a somewhat obnoxious review of House of Leaves, but after some thought, have decided to edit it.    House of Leaves was mentioned to me by several friends and acquaintances, and hyped as one of the most frightening books they had ever read.  One individual told me it kept them up at night out of terror.  Others had said that they finished the book in a weekend and couldn't put it down.  Now, I love a good horror story, and several people promised me that this was THE horror story to read. After suffering through long boring academic-style descriptions of a house whose insides by far do not match its outsides, and footnotes written by a skeevy tattoo artist, I failed to find the scary.  I looked and looked, but it just wasn't there.    Thus, I'm disappointed.   It isn't so much that I minded slogging through faux academic literature (although that in itself is annoying - how many articles and interviews could possibly have existed on such an underground video project?!), but that I slogged through it looking for something that - for me, at least - just wasn't there.  So, if you want my opinion, the book isn't scary, and it's rather long and dry.  Even the supposedly frightening experiences of Johnny Truant, the tattoo artist, were kind of boring and made my eyes glaze over.  Hence my previous title of "A handful of Ritalin and a pot of coffee couldn't make this readable...".    Do I really need to be brought back to the days of writing research papers for college courses I only took to satisfy some ridiculous requirement?  That's what it felt like 
 The whole idea of checking this book out from the library began when I realized that this story I was writing had a pretty similar plot as the story: a bunch of kids with these talents get called up to go to a special school, where they have their own rooms.  	Since I had taken some ideas (or as I call it, ripped off) from this series of books (or maybe it was from Harry Potter...?), I went to see the next installment in the series for some more ideas, hoping that this book would be better than it's previous counterparts.  	I was wrong.  	From what I had read in its Amazon.com description a long time ago, I thought it would be a bit interesting. The story concerns Charlie Brown, a person with a strange talent for hearing voices from pictures. After finding out his talent in the first book, he gets sent to Bloor's Academy, where many of his classmates have strange talents like him, such as being able to call up storms or having the ability of hypnotism.  	In this book, one of Charlie's friends, who is an orphan and lives at the academy, finally gets adopted by the D'Greys. But it is revealed that they are a child-hating couple, who end up forcing the orphan to sign an oath for obedience. They then end up locking him up behind a force field in an odd place called The Passing House.  	It sounds pretty suspenseful, right?  	But the truth is, the actual story isn't. Not only is the character development lacking, with the characters having no personality, everything gets solved within three pages of the events. Yes, I am sort of exaggerating, but the point I'm trying to make is that there are really no important conflicts, because they just all get solved without much difficulty.  	Another thing that I highly dislike about this story (plus the rest of the series) is that everybody is either good, bad, or good, but being controlled of the bad. Maybe it's just that I've been watching too much anime, where you can actually sympathize with the villains, to various extents. And the fact that none of the villains really have back-stories doesn't help much either.    	I suggest to you not to waste your time on the book, and instead read something else instead, which I have no suggestions for 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 This is a nice organizer for the price.  Easy to use and has all the basic features, but it wouldn't synchronize with Outlook 2003 on a Windows XP computer.  Without the sync feature, it's worthless to me.  I contacted Sharp support several times, but they could not find a solution.    Despite this, they referred me back to Amazon for a refund, which I can't get because it's been more than 30 days since I received the product.  I'm unhappy with the product and I'm unhappy with Sharp 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 I bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me. However, the information provided is too extensive and confusing, listing far too many "points" in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them. The body map listing them is in the first part of the book, so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to. I also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous. The way this system originated is also a little murky. This is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public 
 The story (what I read of it) was okay, but the language was so bad that I skipped over about 1/3 to 1/2 of the book.  I was interested in how it turned out, so I read the ending.  It was only semi-satisfactory 
 I never found  Persepolis to be anything more than a curiosity. For me, the unrealistic artwork prevented any emotional reaction whatsoever  to the material. This is definitely not because the book is a graphic novel.  I learned to read by devouring Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, etc.  But for me, non-fiction requires realistic artwork to be effective.  I found my reading experiences of the two volumes  to be mirror images of each other -- in volume one, my curiosity as to what happened next increased with each story, whereas in volume two each story was less interesting than the one that came before.  I found the stories after Marjane returned to Iran to be banal, even trite.  It was a struggle to finish.  The only thing I came away with from these volumes is that Marjane's family and circle of friends are very westernized.  Is that reflective of the country as a whole?  Who knows. But the narrowness of the book's focus -- and I know it was a memoir and memoirs are very personal and therefore very narrow -- made for a very claustrophic reading experience. I learned a fair amount about Marjane Satrapi, but I'm not sure I learned anything significant about Iran. 
 It should be obvious from the title that Debi Pearl does not understand the Bible.  In the King James translation of the Bible, God says "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."  The word "meet" is an adjective meaning "appropriate," not just a misspelling of "mate" as too many people imagine.  So the question is "what is appropriate"?  If Adam is strong, intelligent, and independent, then (one might reasonably argue) so too should be Eve.  But, whatever you think is appropriate, Pearl has shown even in the title of her book that she doesn't really care what the Bible says or means.  (I guess her husband didn't correct her, so she had no other way of knowing! 
 Compact and cute, with lots and lots of places to record just how often your child defecates and urinates and what color its eyes are.  The novel hook is comparing your baby's record to a maintainence log on a new car.  Office visits are "service records".  Some handy boxed tips, a couple of graphics, but very little information.  Probably better for the glove compartment than the diaper bag 
 I bought this along with the regular Digi Draw & I wasted my money. It is hard to see image to trace. Maker's of this product should have put more effort into making this. Big disappointment 
 The first thing that came to mind as I trudged through Macintyre's wordy book was how could something called "concise" seem so long? This book is informative but entirely humorless, like reading an ingredient list. Macintyre seems more concerned with showcasing his vocabularity then with enticing you with the facinating history of Australia's past. There is plenty of information in this book if you can make it through to the end while maintaining consciousness. If you are about to visit Australia and you are looking for an entertaining and informative book to stimulate your enthusiasm I strongly recommend Bill Bryson's In a Sunburned Country. If you are looking for a strong sedative then this is the book for you.  
 You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his 
 Photek had a article in the Urb one time for the release of Modus Operandi and He said he used other names like studio pressure and Aquarius for stuff that didn't sound like Photek. This Barely sounds like Photek. I also heard he made an album right after modus operandi and it sounded alot like modus operandi. He scrapped it. PHOTEK LISTEN next time do what BIG BUD did on Late Night Blues. He did what he wanted on one disc and he did what he was expected on the other. Especially do it for us kids in the U.S. that can't exactly go to the record store and get your 12"s 
 If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader 
 A lot of people are saying that this album is better than their 1st one. That's not saying much because their 1st album was terrible. There was only one direction they could go -- up. It's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first LP. I said this about the Young, Fly, & Flashy album, and the same applies here, so I'll say it again: When the hottest line on your entire album comes from Bow Wow, your album is in serious trouble. But let me balance that statement though. This isn't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics. This is simple, bass heavy, crunk music. It's effective in it's purpose, but it's totally generic (the recipe for most party songs). And some of these songs are just flat out horrible. "Stop Callin' Me" isn't only horrible, but it isn't about anything if you're paying attention to the wack lyrics DFB put on it (and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped). And who's idea was it to let Dame Dash (yeah, THAT Dame Dash) scream all over a song (Bricks 4 The High)? I want to know who the guy was that said "yeah, that's a good idea". Dame is doing what he does best, so he's not at fault.....I blame the idiot that put him on the song. "Suckas Come And Try Me" is probably the worst song to come out of the south since Drama dropped his album. And if you ask me, the "White Tee" remix was a step backward from the original. It would help if they could talk about something other than "haters", postin' up on the block (I swear they say that on the album at least 100 times), rims, jewelry, and weed. But expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part I guess. Besides, if people buy this, why should they change? That's another story though. In short, the album fails to seperate DFB from the pack. The beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible ("I'll make you 1 2 step like Ciara"? Come on, I could write that in my sleep) And it's hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar.   Once you understand the purpose of this album though, then you can find a few decent tracks, but don't go getting your hopes up just yet. There are only 3 or 4 songs worth hearing. "My Music" is listenable and DFBs put down some decent lyrics that are helped out by Bun B's good appearance. The best beats on the album are on "Don't Play With Me" feat. Three Six Mafia and "Freaky As She Wanna Be". "Don't Play With Me" features production from DJ Paul & Juicy J, so you know it's tight. I love Three Six, so that's my favorite song on the album. And "Freaky As She Wanna Be" will be the second single off the album if they're smart.   On Top Of Our Game is good for what it's supposed to be good for (partying and....well, that's it), but not much else. Jermaine Dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant, but I don't know if this approach is gonna help him any. This album is better than their debut, but that's not really saying much. This should be pretty obvious, but I'll say it anyway. If you're into lyrics, then this isn't for you. If you want crunk beats to bounce to, then this is right up your alley. It depends on your preference, but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends passing on this one.   Standout Tracks: Freaky As She Wanna Be, I Think They Like Me (Remix) feat. JD, Da Brat, & Bow Wow, Don't Play Wit Me feat. Three Six Mafia (My Favorite), and My Music feat. Bun B. 
 Todos los tpicos tienen algo de verdad, y aqul que dice que Borges es un escritor pedante para pedantes no es en absoluto una excepcin. Sus historias, a pesar de estar cuajadas en ocasiones de ideas interesantes, se ven total y completamente empaadas por el afn didctico y pomposo del autor a la hora de inundar sus escritos con referencias tanto reales como imaginarias a todo tipo de obras, autores, sucesos, etc, etc. Sus cuentos suelen adoptar ms bien la forma de un ensayo o de una disertacin filosfica que la de un relato convencional. Esto bien podra parecer algo original y audaz a simple vista, pero su ya mencionado didactismo, su escaso ritmo y la casi nula caracterizacin de sus personajes, restan muchsima fuerza a unas historias que, entre tanto aderezo culto y metaliterario, pierden todo aliciente a los ojos de cualquiera que haya disfrutado de narradores ms hbiles y conocedores del medio en el que se mueven.   Todava estoy tratando de dilucidar por qu diablos cosas como "Ficciones" o "El Aleph" estn consideradas como obras maestras cuando su inters no me parece que vaya ms all de lo puramente anecdtico. A todas luces el de Borges es un caso claro de egocentrismo o de vastas influencias literarias mal asimiladas.  Los aduladores borgianos, esa grimosa secta compuesta (generalmente) de elitistas literarios, seguramente dira, leyendo crticas como la ma, que la razn por la que Borges me desagrada es "porque no lo entiendo". Nada de lo que preocuparse, pues es bien sabido que para ellos toda aquella crtica negativa a su escritor de cabecera viene dada desde la frustracin de quien no logra aprehender al "seor del bastn". No falla, probad a poner en duda la grandeza del argentino, y ya veris cmo en pocos instantes os llueve encima un torrente de dicterios por parte de sus incondicionales poniendo en duda toda vuestra cultura general. En fin, que visto lo visto habr que borrar la palabra "pedante" del diccionario, total, como no hay libros malos, sino slo libros que no se entienden por los que los critican...  Jams he llegado a observar mayor grado de sectarismo que el que rodea a este autor por parte de muchos de sus admiradores (ni siquiera por los fans ms agresivos de autores "frikis" como Tolkien o Lovecraft), y en parte es por eso tambin por lo que no me gusta. He llegado a conocer gente que modifica sus gustos y preferencias literarias como borreguines para que casen exactamente con los de Borges. Y es que es tal el grado de arrobamiento comnmente requerido para la "correcta" apreciacin de este escritor, que de verdad a m me enferma. Sin duda a Borges se le puede considerar, independientemente de sus mritos literarios, un autntico soberano de insufribles.  No niego que Borges era un buen lector, que su amor por la literatura se deja traslucir de sobra en sus escritos, y que como crtico era bastante avispado, pero desde luego, en el plano literario, era totalmente incapaz de algo tan sencillo como contar una puetera historia sin exhibir gratuita y sistemticamente su supuesto grado de erudicin. En mi opinin, un narrador nefasto que obliga al lector a "adaptarse" continuamente y sin remisin a sus referentes culturales (como si stos fueran imprescindibles o necesariamente fascinantes). Presuntuoso, superfluo y, sobre todo, frustrante, pues promete lo que ni sabe ni puede dar.  He optado por escribir este comentario en castellano, idioma en el que Borges redacto sus obras, pero para el que curiosamente nunca tuvo nada bueno que decir hasta que recibi el premio "Cervantes". En fin que -aparte de su incompetencia literaria- fascinante desvergenza la suya (iba a decir "chaqueterismo" pero se me olvidaba que Borges es uno de los pocos con patente de corso para drselas de listo inventando neologismos, as que mejor ser callar, que igual no estoy capacitado, vete t a saber...)     Un clsico sobrevalorado ms (y van...). Puestos a tener que elegir algo que lleve el nombre de Borges, creo que me quedo con la famosa marca espaola de frutos secos. Me resulta ms digerible 
 Wood is unnecessarily hostile to Franklin, strugling to dispel the images created in the Autobiography rather than understanding their impact and relationship to history.  it is a useful book for raw information, but when it comes to analysis of that information, I put far more stock in H.W. Brands' The First American.  Brands better undertsands Franklin's gradual coming to a democratic consciousness while Wood only finds contradiction in Franklin's change of mind 
 No truth to any of it.  Sickeningly manipulative.  Pure trite Hollywood garbage.  I never write negative reviews but shame on these people.  The only laugh I got was at the film's expense during the horrendous now notorious butterfly scene.  A complete insult to the intelligence of the American filmgoer (or any other nation for that matter).   
 I am a huge fan of Umberto Eco, and his novels (Rose and Foucault's Pendulum) and I had high hopes for this collection of essays. Eco is very satirical in these essays, sometimes too much so; the satirical and exaggerating style that is combined with very unusual translation style (ancient words that do not reach the nice rhythm of Eco's otherwise great storytellin in his other works) just got me tired of reading this book. These stories just do not entertain me this time.  Here and there I was able to find a nice story but only few. Language just doesn't get to its pace, and I also have say that majority of the stories are dated for readers in 2006. Stories about telefaxes, etc. are not relevant anymore. But also the general problem of satirical essays is that they are very much tied to the present day when they're written.  Overall, not a bad collection but nowhere near to my expectations 
 So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.   Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!! I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa! It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.   If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.   If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie... There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....   Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????   Yeah... I love movies, good ones and bad ones. But this one???  The WORST movie I have seen so far...  To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing.  Hopefully, someday, there will be 
 Tunku Vardarajan in the India today says, India: a Mosaic is a con job. The word "mosaic" suggests a variety in the book. Instead the book talks about "bleeding-hearted" essays.  According to him,  the articles in the book were published elsewhere and are "profoundly  stale." From my reading of the book i found the book to be a "do  not buy.&quot 
 The Criterion 2-disc edition is far superior in image and sound quality to this release and, most importantly, is the only one endorsed by the surviving creators.  You can receive thoughtful and in-depth information on the film with that release, something Mike Nelson's comedic commentary could never provide.  Plus you get the two original versions of the film, neither of which are colorized 
 Dick Staub makes some very good points and conections to the training of a Jedi in the ways of the Force in Star Wars and the walk of a Christian following God in life today.  However, he does misquote and misinterpret many quotes from the Star Wars movies, and I even found a misquotation from the Bible.  He makes good points, but these details were distracting to me as I read.   I am not yet finished and will leave more once I am done.  After finishing this book it occured to me that Dick Staub needs to take some time to do a couple of things. First he needs to re-read the Bible and get facts correct (He quoted Moses as saying something to Joshua, but Moses was dead at the time and God told it to Joshua). Second, he needs a simple commentary for the passages he misinterprets (He says David had Uriah killed to be the only one Bathsheba loved, He had Uriah killed to cover up his sin). Third he needs to re-watch the Star Wars movies and not bend the quotes of the characters to fit his book (He talks about Obi-Wan asking Yoda for help in Episode II and portrays the event differently than it happens, as well as bends Yoda's reaction to fit what he is trying to show). This book is not what I thought it was, and any Christian who is young in their walk should not read this. 
 This is a literal translation without any soul. Olivelle doesn't have the heart at the right place to translate mystical writings of the Upanishads. He should stick to Jesuit material 
 Sir Leycester Coltman was Head of the Foreign Office's Latin America Department, then Ambassador to Cuba (1991-94), then to Colombia (1994-98). But as this mean-minded book shows, this hardly qualified him to write `the real' biography of Fidel Castro.   This book gives the Foreign Office view, brimming with anti-trade union, anti-national and anti-communist sneers. For example, he casts doubts on Fidel's brother's parentage, citing as evidence Raul's `slanted oriental eyes', but even the book's photos disprove this.   Coltman patronisingly assumes that Britain can give lessons in democracy to Cuba, but how many of us voted Mandelson an EU Commissioner? Coltman smugly assumes that capitalism means progress, but capitalism, a mode of production, does not make technological innovations or scientific advances: the working class makes them all. He cannot describe US imperialism and the illegal US blockade without putting the offending words in inverted commas.  He claims that the Macmillan government's decision to sell the Cuban dictator Batista warplanes and tanks was `commercial rather than political', because Britain's economic situation was `desperate'.  When Macmillan refused to sell Hawker Hunter fighters to Castro to defend Cuba against imminent US aggression, the situation was presumably not so desperate. Kennedy's illegal assault on Cuba showed that Bush's practice of unilateral, aggressive war is nothing new.  Cuba's eight million people have sustained independence and sovereignty, repelling all efforts to interfere in their internal affairs. So Fidel rightly opposed the Sandinistas' 1989 decision to bow to US-EU demands to hold multi-party elections in Nicaragua: the Sandinistas even let the US government fund the opposition.   He warned, "Some people think they can save socialism by making concessions. They fail to take account of the voracious mentality of imperialism and of the reactionary forces. If you give them part of a fingernail, they will want part of your finger; if you give them a piece, they will want the whole finger; if you give them the finger, they will ask for the forearm; if you give them the forearm, they will ask for the arm; and when you give them the arm, they will chop off your head."  
 trying is the best word to describe this movie. it tried my patience. the opening scene was several minutes of nothing and i had to hold myself back from turning the movie off. I told myself, give it a chance, and i repeated that through the entire film. somewhere with in 90 minutes I just wanted to find out what was happening and why... well i can't spoil the movie but... it tried to be artistic. in fact i think most of the people who review this movie with five stars want to be artsy. examining composition and frames and dialog and colors and blah, blah, blah. this movie was a waste of my time. the only theme or concept i took away from the film was that upper class French people are annoying 
 People magazine is one of the worst expressions of American life.  Instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - People encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images, people we will never meet, and in many cases people who have very little going for them. Does anyone really think that Britney Spears has anything to say about anything, or that Paris Hilton is barely  aware of her own existence?  Does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times J.Lo is engaged (in order to get on the cover of another magazine) or who Demi Moore is grinding with today or where Gweyneth gets her gowns

 I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve the one I gave it. It's a light stroller..there...the only plus. Where do I start...how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn't have a reciept ( it was shower gift) After arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it, they shipped a new wheel free of charge...Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii. The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun. The steering stinks, I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn't hold anything but a small water bottle. The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward. My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn't paved. He asked me, "Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand?" I replied "PLEASE....I hope someone takes this piece of @8!!8#!!!" End of story...I wouldn't invest in the Pliko P3 either. Don't get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either...JUNK!! 
 sorry to say but not well illustrated and not easy to follow look elsewhere for help in this area...I wish I could recommend options but other then Old House Journal(a monthly magazine) I could not recommend a good trim refrence. I will note a couple of my own tricks though.  First remember that the most complicated trims are usually built in stages or layers.  Second remember that good trim starts with good framing and straight bases (the object you are trying to frame ie: window door opening ect). Last but not least if your painting don't go nuts for the perfect joint.  Caulking can save your day..that does not mean to be sloppy, measure twice, cut once, remember to factor the width of the blade waste; but then use a premium grade (GE Silicone II Extreme) caulk to join butt and corner pieces.  Good luck .. 
 OK performances in a completely predictable story.  Nothing new here, living off Tarantino's success filmmakers, producers and writers rewrite his film over and over, as in Fall Time 
 Usually I like fantasy, comic fantasy, parodies of all sorts etc... but I simply was not able to move beyond first ten pages -and believe me, I tried! After all those good reviews...  being not able to read even half a book - this almost does not happen to me (usually I feel obliged to author to read more, before passing judgement). BORING 
 I have had nothing but problems with this book.  The practice problems in the chapter do not reflect the ones at the end of the chapter, which pretty much leaves it up to you to figure out what is going on.  The chapters are not well written in the first place!  Very hard to follow!  There is no supplemental solution manual to follow along with so you can see how the practice problems were solved.  I could go on and on.  In general, possibly the worst chemistry text I have ever had to use 
 Maybe I should have known better, but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same. This is a four dollar movie in any department store 
 Karen Rose became an auto-buy for me after I read her latest, You Can't Hide, then bought I'm Watching You. Those two are the most enjoyable romantic suspense books I've read in a long time. Rose made me enjoy a serial killer story - something that had become passe for me over the last few years.   I can't give Have You Seen Her the same accolades. First, Steven Thatcher is a wimp, his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man I've come across in a romance. That he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars. Special Agent, Neil, deserved the girl, not Thatcher, and Jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that Thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her. I just couldn't see how Jenna could have her HEA with a man like that. Each time Steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction, I was willing Jenna to forget the guy and look at Neil instead.  I was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was. All I can say is that I'm so glad I didn't read this book first when I decided to try Karen Rose. It would have put me off completely and I'd have missed the not-to-be-missed books of the two Reagan brothers 
 This book has very little to do with money a very much to do with sending money to the church. I bought a copy for each of my girls, 16 and 18 years old, each of them very spiritual, and they were both very turned off by the "preachy" context of the book. In fact, the 18-year-old told me she felt like she learned nothing about money, and as for the spiritual side, there are better books for that as well. She was especially turned off by one passage that recommended one way of making more money is giving more to the church 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 Presents an unconvincing case about the origins of caste. Smith seems to  have been swamped by information so that he missed the woods for the trees 
 I've not found anything from Memorex that works right, try Maxell products from Amazon, you can't find better products and the best customer service on the net. 
 I have always been a fan of Zig, that is until this book. What ever happened to Zig's own Network Marketing Company? That's right it went under. Not even the marketing power of his name could save it and now he wants to tell you how to build a solid business? Zig is a great sales trainer and motivator but it's evident from this book that he didn't have much hands on experience in this business. At one point he says that you should be proud of being in the "sale profession" and then in another part he says the Network Marketing isn't about sales. Network Marketing is a legitimate business not a get rich quick scheme. Unfortunately too many people sell it as the latter and this time Zig goes along. As a seven figure earner myself I would recommend other sources like Leaders Club, for honest information about what it takes to really make it big in this business. If you want a great Ziglar book get, "5 Steps to Successful Selling.&quot 
 The frontal wound was one of an EXIT not entry. No support for Dr Crenshaw from me 
 I have bought a number of Sams books and found most of them very instructive, but this book was a total waste of time and money.  There's no logical pattern to learning XML presented in this text.  Topics are scattered and there's no recognizable learning pattern.  There are too many references to SGML and HTML, and too few XML hand-on examples.  If you need to understand the history and similarities of XML to HTML and SGML, go ahead and buy this book.  If you need to apply XML or need to develop a good understanding of it for future development, look into a book that walks you through the development of practical applications 
      David Sklansky is a very well known mathematically oriented poker player.  He has written such icons as The Theory of Poker, Tournament Poker for Advanced Players, and 7 Card Stud for Advanced Players.  He also wrote Hold 'em Poker and co-authored the sequel with Mason Malmuth.  These books have laid the foundation for how many players play these forms of poker.  Ed Miller wrote the book Small Stakes Hold 'em, which again is an gem.  However, most all of their previous work has dealt with fixed betting limits and expectation formulae. No Limit Hold 'em is as beautiful and complex a game as can be found nowadays.  No surprise that given its popularity the masses are hungry for a comprehensive book dealing explicitly with the subject.  Doyle Brunson's priceless section in Super Systems has for a long time quenched this desire, but as of late people seem to be craving more.  So what better way to satisfy this need than to crank out a book with one of the most popular authors with one of the biggest authorities on poker (two plus two) to publish it?      Admittedly, the authors give a "disclaimer" in the introduction about how they were skeptical about writing a book solely dealing with the subject because of the complexity.  So it's no surprise they forwarn the audience that the book will take a mathematical approach to its situations.  It is full of examples filled with percentages and the mathematical rigor we've come to expect from a book written by Sklansky.      However, it is possible to get too carried away with the mathematics, as the rigor not only seems to draw some very strange conclusions, but sometimes it flat out contradicts what Sklansky advises in some of his other books.  (For example, in Tournament Poker for Advanced Players, he advises folding a small favorite hand on the bubble to avoid taking unnecessary gambles, but here he says sometimes you should make calls as an underdog in the same situation).      Another problem is how the mathematically derived advice seems to completely circumvent the fact that the game is No Limit Texas Hold 'em in the first place.  The section on the Sklansky-Chubukov rankings gives interesting information, but is not very useful because not only are there many ways to play AK other than moving all-in or folding preflop, but also assumes your opponent is a computer who knows your hand and plays perfectly every time.  I don't know about anybody else, but I can't remember the last time I sat at a table with one of those.      It frequently takes best and worst case scenarios and sets them as the standard for the advice they give.  For example, they advise that buying into a game short stacked is a very good strategy, because it will often force your opponent to play incorrectly against you in multiway pots.  The reason is because, as they assume, you are in the best case scenario: in the pot with close to the nuts, and your opponents are big dogs hoping to get lucky on somebody else with a bigger stack who's also in the hand.      This kind of approach is understandable, since pure mathematics leaves little room for human creativity.  But in a game where creativity is more important than the cards that are dealt, there is ultimately little use of it. 
 This movie has the most profound sense of materialistic humor.  Are we all so insecure with ourselves that we actually find this to be funny?  Sublimally the sacastic scenes hitting upon peoples cultures and ways of religion down grades our intellectual consciousness as a society.  I'm not a stiff when it comes to humor, but I trying to be a gentleman in society am apalled with Fox.  Fox Network is a base for right-wing Republican stupidity.  This movie focuses on and reinforces the materialistic and superficial aspects of our inner insecurities.  I think one should only see this film to see where the morals and values of American humor have gone.  Hurray for the 1st amendments and others our Four Fathers came up with, I think they were brillant men.  I am all for Free-Speech but I believe there are parameters for moral and ethical conducts to showing a film to the public.  This film definitely over stepped its boundaries.  For all those people who loved this movie...why are there sooooo many (around 180) used copies that people are trying to sell when it just came out only a few months ago!?!?!  I thought good movies are the ones people kept and held onto...Just a fellow gentleman adding my two cents 
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 Any sound psychologist would want to "shape" the lives of girls as well as boys,to shape them into adults,but this writer wants us to see girls and women as eternal children,who need over  protection,never need to face real challenges,or real life. He doesn't seem to realize many girls need coraling in not only  boys.Instead he sets up a system where expectations are low for  girls,so parents might put less effort into a girl's education, aspirations and talents.Speaking of talents,he believes females and males have very distinct differences in the talent pool. Males analyical,females emotional intellence and verbal. How can a parent help their girl along if they believe she doesn't or shouldn't excell in hard science and maths. His obvious mysogamy is only too noticable,he doesn't want girls to excell or even try their hand in areas he feels are more  easily understood by boys. I have never read such a harmful book in my life.This psychobable will only prove how he is determined to work against females and trap them in small areas of achievement. Poor book,poorly written,works off of spotty brain research and sterotypes 
 Never have I seen a movie violate a book so badly. John Grisham's Runaway Jury is a moral microcosm of free will versus addiction, in which the widow of a life-long smoker takes on Big Tobacco in the courtroom. The movie Runaway Jury is a slapped-together suspense chase, in which the entire premise is changed into the widow of shooting victim taking on gun manufacturers.  This movie is, at most, a caricature of the book, and not a flattering one at that. Hackman transforms Fitch's quiet menace into arrogant buffoonery; a man who waves his arms and throws phones at the wall. Parts of Marlee's life-altering past are tranformed into vaguely impersonal events. The most interesting aspects of the story--jury selection and Nicholas Easter's manipulation of the court--are grudgingly presented in minute-long montages in order to get back to the yelling and frantic running around.  If I had never read the book, I would consider this a run-of-the-mill flick, rent-worthy at best. But knowing how atrociously the screenwriters have butchered the concept makes the movie all the more empty and sad. Even if you aren't a lover of fiction, I highly recommend buying the book instead. 
 I travel a lot, especially to Europe, and hate taking lots of cables with me for the Vonage, router, laptop, cellphone and crackberry. The iJuice unit looked like a good idea.  HOWEVER, the unit just failed during my trip, leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back-up.  BAD IDEA  A friend switched me on to charging everything via USB.  I just bought a cheap $5.00 USB charger for the Nokia, the crackberry charges via USB anyway, so I just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110/240v adaptor  and I was all set. Laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time.  Single point of failure is the laptop. However, Apple does a great universal adaptor (you can get UK./US etc plugs) with USB for charging Ipods for $20, all in one neat unit. You can just stick the USB for the Nokia in the back.   Seriously, don't waste your money, unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you can't charge via USB. Using USB is far lighter, far more reliable, you don't loose the tips. 
 Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  Nothing happens, the killer is zero-percent exciting.  Overall a very lame read 
 A cookbook (even one for raw foods) should give you enough information to make the foods included.  This book just doesn't.  My favorite is the recipe for vanilla pudding that lists as ingredients: 1 cup dates, 1/2 cup dates.  That's it.  Did anyone try the recipes?  So many of the recipes require SO MUCH work... and ingredients that are just too hard to find anywhere.  I really like the idea a lot -- and the restaurant is amazing.  But, this book just seems to be on the high-end of raw foods -- most things take a LOT of effort and a multitude of ingredients.  There are problems with several recipes that make me think nothing was reviewed or tested.  For food that is so much work... the very least he could do is make sure it was accurate.  Not a good book for the above-average interest level raw foody person.  I'm a vegan and like the whole raw food thing... but THIS book is a terrible place to start 
 I saw this on a "best of 2005" list and I have to say I am disappointed. The musicality of this record is not too bad. It's not terribly creative, but it is enjoyable. What really turned me off was the incredibly vapid and thoughtless lyrics. Unfortunately this is just another pop record, of which there are way too many these days. The only track on here that I would give a second listen too is seagull. I wouldn't recommend the rest of the album 
 MARK FURHMAN??? HMMMM THE MAN WHO LIED ON THE STAND AT O.J'S TRIAL, THE MAN WHO KNOWS NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THIS CASE WRITES A BOOK??????  WHO IS HE AND HOW IN THE WORLD CAN HE MAKE ALL THIS MONEY WRITTING NOTHING MORE THAT TRASH. ALL THIS BOOK IS, AND EVER WILL BE GOOD FOR,IS BURNING MATERIAL OR TOILET TISSUE. I READ SOME OF IT, WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME THATS FOR SURE. I NEVER WOULD HAVE SPENT A PENNY ON IT LOL, YOU COULDN'T PAY ME TO BUY IT, BUT IT WAS AT AN OFFICE I VISITED SO I READ A FEW CHAPTERS AND ALL I COULD DO WAS GET SICK TO MY STOMACH, AND OR LAUGH AT HIS STUPIDITY... THIS MAN DISERVES NOTHING.... ANYONE WHO BUYS IT SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR BRAINS, ITS SURE NOT WORTH IT.... 
 I host a Karaoke show in Nashville. I have never bought Disney Karaoke CD's. However, I will offer you one tip. A lot of people are mislead by "Karaoke Cd". Always read on the disc and make sure it says CD+G on it. I bought some  Chartbuster Karaoke CD's that were on clearance for 2.99 each. I thought I had a deal. It was just that-a CD and not a CD+G (Compact disc + graphics). Fortunatly, they took them back and refunded my money. Karaoke CD's are usually just background music 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 When putting this album together, Bob Dylan is said to have referred to it as "Self-Portrait II," but this is less a sequel to that delightfully daring mess than a continuation of 1986's "Knocked Out Loaded." Like that listenable grab-bag of an album, "Down in the Groove" mixes covers with a mere handful of Dylan originals, and, in the case of the latter, most are co-written with the Grateful Dead's Robert Hunter.  The closest thing to a classic here is "Silvio" which demonstrates that Dylan (or is it Hunter?) still has a gift for lyrics and can rock out when he feels like it, but "Ugliest Girl in the World" works fervently to counter that claim.   Then there's "Death is Not the End," a dreary march through musical purgatory that didn't make the final cut on "Infidels," proof that Dylan's judgment when making that 1983 album was not as impaired as the exclusion of the superb "Blind Willie McTell" would suggest.  The covers are a mixed bag with some worth a listen ("Let's Stick Together" and especially "Rank Strangers to Me") and the others barely worth the space they take on the disc. After his heartfelt version of "Dixie" in "Masked and Anonymous," it would be nice to hear Dylan's take on "Shenandoah," but that touching traditional is given a rushed reading with different lyrics that prevent it from being memorable.  This may be the least significant disc in Dylan's history and, therefore, of interest only to the completists among us.  Brian W. Fairbank 
 I began to read this book with the hope there would be some new insights but very soon it became clear that the author did not understand his subject well enough to accurately explain basic physics. When I am told that an accelerating system is in equilibrium I am not impressed. The bad physics even detracted from any value as a historical read. If the author can't explain accurately the basic ideas of the book how badly is the historical information being twisted to serve his conclusions. I put a note inside the cover telling my grandkids to read this one with a critical eye 
 I know the book is aimed at "young adults" but I cannot help pointing out that over 100 pages of psycho-babble with a "see the end from 20 miles away" style is just horrible to read! If you have actually read 1984 then leave this "book" alone 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 Why in the world would anyone publish a writer's bread and butter notes to his agent?  Besides the money, I mean.  There are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom Heinlein feels did him dirty.  But in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master.  Just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 For the total novice who has very limited experience in writing and publishing, this book will be treasure trove, especially if that novice is planning to write a non-fiction book. For everyone else, this book has lesser value. I found it offered very little for writers of fiction. The information offered was also rather basic; for a person with a moderate amount of writing experience, the book offered little in the way of insightful information. The "for Dummies" part of the title definitely applies in this case 
 I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy. However, this third book needs some serious time in the Intensive Book Surgery Unit before it should have even been published. Frankly, this manuscript should have been kicked back from the editor to the author and refused. I realize that's a pretty heavy thing to say, but it's true. Something went badly wrong here.  The author did not do his job in bringing his protagonists to closure; having two kids fall in love, then decide to live apart for the rest of their lives is a complete crock. Puhleaze. I grew to rather like the aeronaut Texan and the explorer, and they're killed to little point. Puhleaze. Iorek the Bear is darn cool, and he barely (sorry) makes an appearance in book 3. Puhleaze. And, by the way, who is Mary, introduced so late in the trilogy, as an underfunded Dark Matter physicist (who just happens to be ... an ex-nun ... now, just wait a minute here, is that heavy handed or what?)... and Dark Matter would be *under* funded? Puhleaze. (Although these days, she'd be working on Global Warming.) And Mrs. Coulter, in a lifetime full of being evil, suddenly has a turn of heart (yes, just like The Grinch), and, in her new fullsome of goodness, helps kill an angel. Huh? What? Say that again?     I was thrilled (not) at Pullman's description of an endless, boring ... [come to think of it, very much like reading Volume III of this trilogy] ... somewhat-Purgatory-Without-Dante's-Skill that apparently is his vision of death. Everyone stands around being ... boring. Gosh, how exciting, what a vision, et cetera. It's duller than the endless views of the Enterprise in Star Trek I. It's more boring than the endless endless views of the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When the dead people standing around there are given the chance to decompose, they go for the gusto. As to why any of this should be in a book, I can only offer my puzzlement.       Jerry Pournelle once gave me some terrific advice. "Never give a reader a chance to put down one of your books, because if you do, they will, and they'll never pick it up again.". I zoomed non-stop through the first two books of this trilogy. The last book took me a week plus and I was extremely annoyed with it.   I was amused that Philip Pullman, in his Afterword, gives credit to stealing his ideas (those are his words) from Paradise Lost (John Milton). Frankly, I wish he had stolen more, this book would have been better. His utter hatred of The Church shines through this book. He has sort of an Idiot's Guide to Quantum Mechanics but isn't up on it.     This mess needs to be storyboarded, and everything that does not PROMOTE THE STORY needs to be chucked out. And that's about half of this book. Whoever edited this book badly needs to be chewed out. I suspect, though, that it boiled down to "not enough time to fix" in the publishing schedule; Del Rey is not noted for publishing messes like this.  
 This is an awful movie. No chemistry between the characters, the plot is ridiculous. 
 We were really looking forward to the release of this book, only to be sadly disappointed!  Instead of categorizing the items pictured by the companies who produced them, they are set up by the production year, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, etc!  There is an index in the back but it's rather confusing and who wants to spend time flipping back and forth!  Definitely NOT a user friendly book.  I suppose you have to take different areas of the country into consideration but I've found the prices are totally unrealistic.  Makes me wonder if Mr. Chipman is wanting to sell his collection!  On the plus side, the pictures are good.  
 (a note from me again, i rated this 5 out of 5, somehow it says 2 stars,,THATS WRONG, I think this book is very GOOD)   I also couldnt put this book down, it has a very smooth flow to it. After realising candy wasnt a true story , i was so surpirised, i have experienced heroin up close and personal, the mind evolving, comforting, soft feeling, soul embracing goods and the really, cold, shatterin, body aching, mind controling bads. I found this book so realistic of how it really is, from the funny bits, IE, the four tourniques on the sofa was very realistically funny for me, altho jokes aside it is sad how one is pushed to mad measures to get the heroin into ones bloodstream, coz any other way is a waste of time and when the user is desperate there cant be any waste of time and most importantly heroin.  The end of the book portrays the tiresome relationship between the user and the drug, somehow the user wants that feeling to last for ever, but somehow the user just gets so tired that the only way out is to surrender to recovery or to death, if money grew on trees then maybe this wouldnt be the case, as alot of the being tired is the scammin part. Findin ways of gettin money otherwise one faces the worst kinda of mental and physical torture ever. Its constant as sure as the sun will come up everyday, a junky knows that they have to keep well and if that includes robbin their broke almost dead grandmother, then thats the way it has to be, the user will always justify why they do wot they do, thats how many deal with the emense guilt of screwing people over all the time, specially their loved ones. This isnt b/c they r emtionless beings but the drive for heroin is unlike no other, specially b/c if u dont have it u will get "sick", and theres no fighting or denying that.  Neway as someone who has been in the circles , id recommend this book if u want a realistic portrayal of how heroin addiction is and how it progresses, of how it is the most beautiful thing and how it becomes the most boring thing, that robs ure soul and in many cases ure life.  PEACE,LUV,LIGHT,UNITY AND RESPECT TO ALL! 
 Beyond the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle and the secrets of the Pyramids, the other great mystery of the universe is why exactly I keep reading New Frontier novels. I recently realized though that I enjoy the stories and the idea of the characters, but I just don't like the execution of either. So I guess I found what it was that kept me coming back, but Stone and Anvil was standard New Frontier: pretty average. There's good. And there's bad.  The good: seeing Mackenzie Calhoun's days at Starfleet Academy was quite interesting. I especially loved how he handled the dreaded Kobayashi Maru test and his reasoning behind it. His growth from outsider to someone slightly more civilized was fun to read about, even if it was really skimmed over. Frankly, despite its relevance coming in later, this should have been a whole book on its own. Might have even been able to spin off a couple of Harry Potter-esque novels about Calhoun at the Academy. You even had a Hermoine character in Shelby and a Ronald character in Wexler. Why even Dean Jellico was sort of a Professor Snape-like character. Lordy, are Calhoun and Jellico going to be attached at the hip their whole lives?  The book at first looks to be like one of those mediocre Voyager episodes where the A-plot and the B-plot seemed to have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Thankfully, the two do eventually come together thanks to the rather bland cliché of the mad scientist and his pet, though the whole thing ends in probably the stupidest twist I've seen in a Trek book. Seriously, I don't use the word "stupid" much when writing about something, but that's fits the bill for that ending. It was quite groan inducing. Luckily, the very end managed to salvage it a bit with a surprise bittersweet ending.  The present day story about investigating the murder of Gleau was interesting, but could honestly have been more so if we had more of a sense of the Selelvians. They make a brief appearance at the end, but despite all the talk of their abilities, I never really felt like it was any kind of serious threat. Again, there's the fascinating idea of a memberworld working in their own interest possibly to even to subvert the Federation eventually, but again it felt glazed over.  The bad: I think I'm actually growing to hate Elizabeth Shelby. Am I the only one who feels like she's almost regularly being portrayed in a negative light anymore? Both her and Robin Lefler have been taken from their admittedly brief appearances on the show as strong and intelligent women and reduced to shrill, whiny children. Perhaps that's too harsh when it comes to Shelby, but definitely not in the case of Lefler, who for the last many books including Stone and Anvil has been almost defined solely by her constant over-reaction to pretty much anything having to do with her mother. It stopped being interesting a long time ago.   For Shelby, it's become more the constant portrayal as the one trying to think rationally when Peter David likes to make so much of New Frontier about instincts this and instincts that. I really can't put more of a finger on it than that right now, but it's just this feeling I get myself. Everyone else stays the same, with some characters like Si Cwan not even appearing in the book this time around. Calhoun has always been David's strength since he's the center of the whole series and it's really no different here, though I almost get the sense that the writer is "really" fond of his main character.   With the news that the next several New Frontier books will all be hardcovers (why exactly I don't know), I find that that doesn't really bother me. New Frontier has become the harlequin romance trash of Trek and as I keep saying, that doesn't exactly make them bad. But it sure doesn't make them all that great either 
 I notice all of them only have one review each. Oh well conspiracy theories aside, Overpriced the book doesn't deliver what it promises. Brief superficial over view of animation, more of the book is given to listing past animators, Than any current how-to info 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.  Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.  Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.    Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still. Maybe it's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can't reach it. Overall, I'd say this product is garbage 
 I am a studant of gardnerian wicca and I like when elders says: "keep wicca traditional". this is a book of recipes, another one book of a ecletic, self-initiated "wicca" (or witch, or reclaiming, whatever). Is poor in poetry and in rituals. I only take 5% useful from all this pages. I consider this book the same fluffy wicca started by Scott Cunningham. For youngs who want start in practice of wicca, very well, but only for start as curious and a dedicant, this can't show you what wicca really is. It is a joke to sincere seekers, is an outrage to elders 
 I've read a bit more than half of this book, and I can already say that it is probably the most RACIST book I've ever read. While trying not to make race a big issue in this novel(I think that's what Lehrer was trying to do by having a diverse debate panel), the author made the fact that Barbara Manning(African-American) and Henry Rodriguez(Hispanic) were minorities THE central issue inadvertently.  Every time these two characters are mentioned in the novel, their ethnicity is brought up.  Even worse, the character of Henry is a stereotype of Mexican people.  On page 111, it is mentioned that Henry's favorite food is a bean burrito.  Nearly every time Henry makes a statement in the novel, he uses the word "Ole`".  I'm still waiting for him to break out and start refering to people as "Essay"(which, I'm sure is coming up)  I think that the only thing Lehrer knows about Hispanic people is what he learned by listening to Cheech from Cheech and Chong!  I'm not even going to start on the fact that every Republican in the novel is portrayed as a Neo-Nazi-type of supervillan.  This is a book with weak characters that use poor dialogue 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 After a long wait for this book I was disappointed to find it not the authors normally great work.  The writing style was choppy and hard to follow.  The was plot weak and the content not very interesting 
 I have used Lonely Planet guides for several years, and have found them to be uniformly excellent -- except for this one.  An experienced climber, backpacker and hiker, I recently completed a loop hike described in this book (Needle Mountains, Winnemuche Wilderness in Colorado).  Surprisingly, my hiking companion and I found the time estimates given for each section of the hike to be laughably incorrect (i.e., at least 50% too short in duration).  I then checked time estimates given for other hikes I have done in past and found the same problem (e.g., backpacking into the Cirque of Towers in the Wind River Range from the Big Sandy trailhead takes 6 hours -- pure rubbish).  I am now quite suspicious of the book's accuracy, and wonder whether anyone who wrote the book actually undertook the described hikes.  I was also quite annoyed with the gratuitously sniffy descriptions sprinkled throughout the text, such as "the poor food and urban sprawl characteristic of the Rocky Mountain region" -- remember, however, that the book's authors are British.  Save your money for better books written by local writers/hikers who actually know the trails.  Tom Woods Lyons, Colorad 
 If you want to get introduced to the radical conservative concept in plain english you can probably read the book. The book, quite disappointingly, doesn't present logical arguments which is quite putting off for a rational reader. I'll quote an example from Chapter 9 (Why Government Is The Problem):   "It is one thing for the government to provide the basic necessities of life to the "truly needy," people, a group that would include the poor, the sick and the disabled. It is another thing for government to take resources from one middle-class family and give them to another middle-class family. This happens when, for example, the government builds a mass transit system. People who prefer to drive cars must prefer to pay for the transportation preferences of the people who prefer to take the subway."  Now from above argument it seems that people driving cars are doing some kind of charitable favour to people taking the subway. But how about people riding in subways paying for the freeways/highways other people drive their vehicles on.  And similarily all over the book the arguments are pretty loose and unappealing. Another example in chapter 14 (Why Professors Are So Left-Wing):   "Conservatives tend to go to business because they care more about money; liberals tend to into the academy because they care more about power".  I am not sure if I understand the above argument but it seems illogical for people to join academia if they are hungry for power - don't know if there is a "How to become a US Senator for Dummies" but I don't think it would recommend becoming a faculty member in an Ivy League school if one is looking for a seat in Congress. 
 I had heard that this film was "really funny" and "worth watching".  I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan but I am a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken.  I was sorely disappointed with this film.  The audience can't relate to the main character at first because he is just down right irritating.  I was hoping that the gags would get funnier but they didn't.  I also found most of the film rather depressing as we watch the main characters life being slowly destroyed around him.  Overall Click was ok, Kate Beckinsale looked beautiful as usual but even that was not enough to save it.  I would NOT recommend buying this film.    
 I have three qualms with this book:   1. The characters become so painfully annoying over the course of it's 175 pages that, by the time the story has completely unfolded, we just don't care about what happens or might happen to them.   2. The book takes the moral highground. This is perhaps it's greatest flaw; the narrator, David, is painfully opinionated on all that surrounds him. I know this is something that can never be completely avoided in a first-person narrative, but it could have been handled with a lot more grace than what Larry Watson has done here.   3. The story is uninteresting. Not meaning to belittle Larry Watson's talent as a writer, because he certainly has a knack for descriptions of people and place, but we simply don't care about the majority of the events that unfold.   Read something else; save yourself from boredom and disconnection. 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks.  This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger.  I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item. We own two of them, and they keep our baby very cozy and warm 
 I don't like this cd, in my opinion, the great progresses she reached with "Crystal Clear" was not reached with the latest albums. She's doing more of the same boring songs as in the beginning. I prefer crystal clear because it sounds more modern than this 
 I'm changing my vote to 4 because I was a bit harsh on critiquing this book. I went through the book again and I found that the book does suit beginner anatomy really well. As another reviewer, I was turned off by the art but nonetheless it is a decent book on the subject and I recommended it to beginners and others alike.  If your looking for other good figure drawing/anatomy books, pick jack Hamm's book "Drawing the head & figure" or Andrew Loomis' "figure drawing for all it's worth" 
 The plot of the story is Ludlum all the way, but the narrative is no where near Ludlum. I am having a hard time getting through it. Will probably give up before half way 
 I'm glad a previous reviewer enjoyed this book and the previous one, but I did not.  I too am a great fan of this series, but the last two books seemed flat to me--not very engaging.  I certainly will continue to read Haney's books about Lieutenant Bak because when they are good(which they usually are) they are very very good 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated 
 I can't judge the Tai Chi but the Yoga in this video was not well done.  The producers hired attractive women with gorgeous bodies and large breasts--but no Yoga skills.  So this video does not combine the beauty of Yoga with the beauty of the human body.  It would be absolutely wonderful to have a talented and flexible Yoga instructor do Yoga postures correctly...and in a manner that is intentionally sexually explicit and erotic.  I don't see any problem with that.  Probably few if any dedicated Yoga instructors would consider doing that sort of video.  I'm sure it would be frowned upon by the serious Yoga community which might consider it degrading.  So we end up with a second rate product like this video.  Too bad.  Nevertheless, I do enjoy watching these women show us their bodies 
 This is a horrible book.  I liked "Abduction", but Chromosome 6 is a piece of trash in comparrison.  The main problem is the characters.  They are ridiculously unreal.  At one point, there are two female characters who coerce a workmate into visiting an island although they're in the jungle, and they know that guerilla soldiers are all around the island.  It's like they don't care about life.  Not only that, but they talk like a couple of barbies, like for example: It would be totally fun to check out that island.  Good idea, Melaine, why didn't I think of that!    The girl's first attempt at reaching the island is disasterous.  Guards shoot at them then arrest them.  A few hours later when they are released.  One of the fearless girls says something like: That totally pisses me off.  I'm going to get on that island if it's the last thing I do.  The other fearless girl agress, and that same night, they are trying a different route to get to the island!    They want to get onto the island to check on some monkeys they've been experimenting on.    They try again and then get shot at again, but this time they are able to run away without being arrested.  The next day they try again!  Meanwhile, they call their male companion a chicken for not wanting to go with them because he's scared of being killed!  They rationalize every moronic thing they do.  They say something like: They certainly won't expect us to do it again.  So we should do it!  Duh!    When they get to the island, they find the monkeys, but these monkeys are big.  Almost two hundred pounds.  For the next few pages, these three idiots are debating whether they sould approach these monkeys for, "a better look," but they are afraid they might scare them away!  What!  Scare away two hundred pound wild animals?  If I would have been there, I would have been running so fast in the opposite direction that I could have run back on the damn water!    The monkeys obviously almost kill them all!  Didn't see that coming, yeah right!    Anyhow, the book is filled with stupid characters running through a forseable plot.  It stunk.    
 This was less of a biography then an extended Rolling Stone record review.  The only thing Dave Marsh likes better than Springsteen is Dave Marsh.  If you want to read the author repeat his interpretation of the lyrics for hundreds of pages and harp on a couple of his own simple-minded themes over and over then this is the book for you.  I found this book almost unbearable to finish even though I am a big Springsteen fan 
 Director:  John McTiernan Cast:  John Travolta, Connie Nielsen, Samuel L. Jackson, Timothy Daly, Giovanni Ribisi, Brian Van Holt, Taye Diggs, Dash Mihok, Christian de la Fuente, Roselyn Sanchez, Harry Connick Jr. Running Time:  98 minutes Rated R for violence and language.  John McTiernan's (the mastermind behind "Die Hard") "Basic" opens up in a rain-drenched Panama jungle at night on an Army training mission headed by Sergeant West (Samuel L. Jackson). Flash forward to the next day. An Army chopper picks up two men from the training mission, one injured and one very much alive. The injured man, Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi), is sent to a hospital, and the alive man, Dunbar (Brian Van Holt) is sent in for questioning by the very sexy and very Southern Osborne (Connie Nielsen). Dunbar refuses to speak to anyone except a Ranger. So in comes Ranger Tom Hardy (John Travolta) to piece together the events surrounding the death of Sgt. West and his team.  Most of the film takes place at night, during a rainy hurricane, and adds to the nonexistent plot. What is so intriguing is that the plot isn't really there, but the writer tries to manifest one, and we feel as if we are staring at some nonexistant, material wad of words and flashbacks and images thrown together in a blender, the writer hoping for it to come out smelling of roses.    The writer of "Basic", James Vanderbilt (whose screen crudentials consist of "Darkness Falls"), has so many twists and turns that the film is impossible to keep up with. It becomes hard to seperate present from past and what's real from what's not. So many revelations happen that the audience will feel they are in the middle of the writer's mind, as he comes up with new ideas and tries to squeeze them in time after time after time. There is a limit to how many times you can use "surprise" revelation endings. Vanderbilt uses three of four in a row, piled on top of each other, time after time after time. Just as we think the plot twists are done, and we start to smile because we think we might finally understand the basis of the plot, something else happens, and we zoom in suspensefully on John Travolta's face as he, along with the audience, realizes something.  The performances of Basic's cast are a mixed bag: Travolta is watchable as usual, and he brings a believable sense of self-assured cool to Hardy, but he is frustratingly unable to contain his hammy instincts. The quality of a Travolta performance appears to be inversely proportional to the volume of his voice.  When he's quiet, he's very good; when he yells, he quickly becomes a cartoon. This movie has enough credibility problems; it doesn't need a cartoon hero.  If Travolta is mixed news, Connie Nielsen is plain bad. It's not so much that she can't seem to make heads or tails of the convoluted story - heck, no one can. But she seems less to be stymied than just exceptionally stupid. The scenes that are supposed to establish romantic tension between her and Travolta fall laughably flat. To top it off, she is saddled with some Hollywood nimrod's notion of a Southern accent, which blinks on and off like a turn signal. The smaller roles, though, fare much better. Van Holt as the prisoner does especially well, flavoring his defiance with feral intelligence. There is also nice work by Taye Diggs as the unit's misfit and Tim Daly (where has he been since "Wings" folded?) as the base commander. The most memorable, though (and you sort of knew this already) is Jackson. He has the lunatic drill instructor bit down pat, and delivers it with relish. His is the one character in Basic who is supposed to be larger than life, in part because he is seen in flashback, which means that we are seeing not the man himself, but other people's impressions of him. In his commando sweater and poncho thrown over one shoulder like a warlord's cape, he looks twenty feet tall and invincible. Still, one of Jackson's great talents is his ability to project nuance and smarts to even the most unsubtle characters. His Sgt. West is the shadow leaning over the whole incident, and the movie would have been smart to take more advantage of that.  The real disappointment in the supporting cast is the normally talented Giovanni Ribisi as the wounded survivor, a hospital-ward weirdo who is supposed to seem mysterious but mostly comes off as jokey and annoying. Ribisi seems to have shoplifted his performance from Gary Oldman in "Hannibal", down to his marble-mouthed line deliveries.  Though "Basic" is shabbily conceived, it is at least presented well by John McTiernan, who manages to wring what tension may be had from the loopy script. The movie is lacking in the action set-pieces McTiernan usually employs, but he nails the atmosphere just right. The use of weather to convey emotion is certainly overdone, but it is still effective when done right, as it is here. The pounding, ever-present rain and the dim, shadow-tinged interior lighting gives the movie the feel of an approaching end, a kind of despairing resignation to horrible things. It's a shame that the drama can't keep up with its own visual metaphor.  It has its merits, but strains your suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point, and washes its credibility away like bloodstains in a rainstorm. 
 The book came as described in excellent shape and arrived quickly.  I hate the book though. The rhymes are not very good. Just a few variations of words but nothing to really jump rump for a long period of time to. I was hoping for some of the playground rhymes I can't remember from childhood. It seemed like somebody just wrote down some words that sorta rhymed but had no reason. 
 I bought this book because amazon recommended it and I was very disappointed.  It's a series of unconnected interviews with crass self-promoting real estate brokers, with a few boring socialites I've never heard of thrown in, for spice I think, but they're really just bland.  Speaking of bland, who cares about Tommy Hilfiger and why start the book with him?  I knew most of the supposedly hot celebrity tid-bits already--they're all recycled from old gossip columns. For $26.95 (okay, even for $18 plus shipping on amazon), I expect more than a 250-page clip-job.  Page Six is free on the web!  But worse, there's no story, no narrative to speak of, no characters you can care about.  It feels as if Gaines was rushing this out, or cashing in on his last, equally disjointed but somewhat more amusing book on the Hamptons, or just phoning it in. What a waste of paper not to mention my time and money!  
 Ok, everyone wants to know how McKinsey does it. Works with leading companies, drives corporate strategy, has great influence and often wind up CEOs in their own right.  Unfortunatley this book does not deliver in any depth in my opinion.  It is more of a casual conversation about McKinsey, how great it is with breif discussions of how they work.  Notions such as 'always involve your client' and 'recognize that you may not always have great data' are obvious and not worth the price of the book -- even if you purchased it used -- which I did.  If you really want to know how the McKinsey mind works I heartly recommend K. Ohmae's "The mind of the strategist"  Ohmae was Mr. Strategy at McKinsey and his book really shows you what's in the mind of this influencial company and its consultants.   The two who authored this book, are really trading on McKinsey's name, brand and reputation.  Its a shame and do not be lured in by the title, read Ohmae's book. 
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
 Though I buy tons of books, I'm never one to write reviews.  But this is so bad, I felt it was my duty to.  I am insanely disappointed with this book. I read it cover to cover and there is not one new idea in here.  Half of it seems stolen from a website I frequent of a woman who has lost 130 pounds.  I wish I would have saved my $.  Oh, and the food is totally bland.  Ick! 
 This fluffy take on the human element of DoCoMo's success will not teach you anything about the wireless industry in Japan or the U.S. and hardly poses as a model or case study for anything related to strategy or how to "become a global force". Check out the market cap for DoCoMo in the last year and a half and look at the value and return in their overseas' investments and you will see why DoCoMo is a typical example of floundering, conservative Japanese management styles that aren't taking the world like a tsunami, but trickling in with little or no impact. Global competitors look at DoCoMo's business model as something to emulate, but their weak strategy and feet dragging business style make them a bloated telecom giant wasting away shareholder value. This books talks nothing of that and merely goes on and on about the success of i-mode, which would be relatively interesting if you hadn't read about it ten times in Business Week or Forbes Magazine in the last two years. NOTE: We used DoCoMo as a case study in my Japanese business school and despite all sorts of flowery talk about the creation and success of i-Mode, nearly every member of the class was critical of this company's overall global strategy 
 Anybody who thinks they're writing a book about the sixty best television  shows ever made yet somehow doesn't include The Simpsons is obviously so  stupid and ignorant that no further comment need be made. Time for this  windy old hack to be sent to the glue factory 
 I bought this book many years ago after buying Dougal Dixon's other two masterpieces, After Man and The New Dinosaurs. But reading THIS book made me sick to my stomach. The idea of using genetic engineering to turn future humans into animalistic creatures was literally an insult to my intelligence, and some of the creatures that are said to have evolved later were simply unscientific and implausible, such as the water seeker and the "memory people". Then aliens descended from humans that have escaped to another part of the galaxy return to Earth after 5 million years and wipe out nearly all creatures on Earth! After a few weeks, I literally threw this book away and my opinion of Mr. Dixon was lowered permenantly. Quite simply, he should never have written this nonsense! Being human himself, how could he have done this to his own species? 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 de K0UNX.  I know radios.  I purchased the Recepter Radio HD a year ago, used it for a weekend and returned it immediately.  Even in the Denver market, with lots of very strong HD signals, this radio had trouble finding them.  I'd be listening to a strong station, and the radio would lose lock, go silent, and rebuffer before coming back to life.  This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it.  I have since purchased a Sangean HDR-1 and love it.  Read my review under the Sangean HDR-1 
 I was excited to see the book with recipes for the "14 Super Foods" after reading Steven Pratt's book, but was very disappointed.  Yes, the recipes do use the "14 Super Foods", but also use such ingredients as shortening, Cheez Whiz, and yellow cake mix - hardly healthy!  If you are interested in eating good, healthy meals made with the "14 Super Foods", don't buy this book 
 Boring!  All this time is spent during the DVD talking about the John Fisher technique, but not really showing you anything specific.  Lots of great video shots of dogs romping about with their owners and shots of classes being conducted, all being voiced over about the 'great john fisher technique'.  Who cares!  I didn't order the video so that I could go look for a trainer who trains with this technique, I ordered it so that I could train my own dog.  So little instructional information was given and the video was so boring, me and my dogs fell asleep watching it.  What a waste 
 Most people buy a UPS, plug it in and never test it to make sure it works. I tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage. I set it to shutdown Windows after 1 minute. Only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it.   After power was cut, it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down. Then I restored power to the UPS. AFter about 30 seconds, it beeped, clicked, and temporarily DROPPED power to the computer while it was rebooting! So when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted. That is unacceptable. A UPS should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it.

 Ok, I admit it--I am getting really disappointed with LKH.  The first books she wrote had plots, wonderful characters, good writing and yes, let's admit it, sexy, sexy, S*E*X*Y males.  But the last few books she's written have been almost nothing but sex.  You almost need note cards to try to keep track of who is sleeping with whom and why.  The plot is disappearing, the writing is getting ho hum and the characters are turning into pretty Barbie and Ken's and not real people.  With Anita Blake I actually CARED about her, and her choices--at least at first.  But the last 3 books I haven't been able to do more than get a couple dozen pages into before I put them aside for something with more exciting in a plot line (like the New York Phone Book.)  I did like the first Merry book--it had a GREAT premise and could have been the start of a new dynasty for LKH.  But this one just didn't do it.  Ok, I liked the idea of trying to figure "which" of the Hollywood sex goddesses of the last 30 or so years could have been the inspiration for that character, but really, other than that--nothing.  I have decided to not bother buying any more of LKH's books and just content myself with checking them out of the library.  That way I won't be disappointed and feel I've wasted my money if she doesn't get her writing act back together and start WRITING again instead of rehashing tired old porn. 
 I had this book as a text book for a skeletal muscle physiology class. I found the style of this book to be very hard to follow. This book presents  a jumbled account of scientific research concerning skeletal muscle. Such  an account may be helpful to a scientist in this field of research who  already knows the basics concerning skeletal muscle structure, growth and  function. However, if you are a student or lay person who wants a broad  overview of skeletal muscle, you will have to weed through alot of jumble  in order to find it in this book 
 When I initially bought this book I thought it would be more of a book on small changes I hadn't thought of before. But, the more I read it, the more I realized how stupid this book can be. The first part of this chapter is on how to breathe. I mean come on people. They also give exercises for eyeballs and bathroom yoga. I'm sorry but I'll pass. I also didn't care for the Christian feel I got with some of the "suggestions". Example p. 40-41 "Here are some other mealtime small changes you can make into habits. Say a prayer, either a ritual prayer from an organized religion or one you write yourself. Sing a song or recite a verse." Christian book is it? The 2 stars are for the inital chapter that got me interested in the book. The rest is junk. 
 I've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, I find it temperamental. It does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. If you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. Now, it turns off while I'm in the middle of doing my hair. The stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as I said, when they work, they're terrific. I'm going to replace mine with another brand 
 I'm not a hard-core DMB fan, but I buy and enjoy most of his stuff.  This album, however, is simply boring and unmemorable.  There's nothing that comes close to showing the true musical talents that I know DMB has.  I got through the first 8 songs and couldn't remember anything about what I had just listened to.  I'll shelve it for a couple months and then listen to it again and may change my mind later, but I'm not very optomistic that it will make a difference 
 The book had an impact on me. It did, for instance, tinker with my idea of what dating should be (or shoudl be like). But the book is like a dogmatic pile of rules that people should abide by. And worse still, the book is interwoven with scripture to make it sound like the Bible says such and such about dating, instead of Joshua Harris.   I know that his heart is in helping people grow in their relationships, but this book is written from a perspective high up on an alter of self-righteousness - and down below, the rest of the world, broken and depraved. I mean, as a student (and now I am a teacher), I have sat through many college courses where professors talk about the ideal of education - every child can learn, every parent cares, and every child comes with some innate bundle of intelligence. But the real classroom is nothing like this. When Harris talks about asking the father of the girl you are about to date for her hand in courtship, or when he discusses going to his father for advise or for his pastor for guidance, I think he is talking about an ideal that few people actually have access to. Should they? Perhaps. But this book is written in such a manner that says that unless you do this, then it is highly improbable that your relationship can survive - or better yet, be as good as his. 
 Allright, listen:  I will break it down for you country simple.  There is very little actual literature in the world and most of that is not recognized as such.  Why?  Because most of the people who set themselves up as arbiters of literary art have no discernment and bad intellectual character and so are easily bamboozled by writing that reflects to them their own dishonesty and narcissism.  Cobroc McGonigle, or whatever his name is, is one of the writers who will be ballyhooed to the skies by the taste frauds who cannot tell what makes good writing and what makes bad writing.  They just can't tell the difference.  And so they are suckered by pretentious, narcissistic phrase-making and word molesting.  Like for example inventing new words like "candleflame"  And churning out lots of copy.  With pretentious and asinine titles like "All the Pretty Horses."  This is the kind of title a teenager with no talent for writing should have come up with in the process of getting an F in high school creative writing.  Basically, the same people who cannot see through William Fakener will be unable to see through Comrod McDougal, only more so.  William Fakener may as well have been reincarnated as Copran McViegle.  He wrote the exact same type of tripe, complete with pretentious, meaningless titles like "Intruder in the Dust."  You intrude in any dust lately?  Oh, I forgot, I'm just not with it enough to swing with the hip literary fast set.  You know, the fast set that is composed of (not "comprised" of , that is a pretentious mis-usage) middle-aged women with vague but rather humble pretentions to art appreciation who join and promulgate book clubs.  They know they're too dumb to "get" why this stuff is so great.  What they don't know is they are actually smart enough to see that the emperor has no clothes.  
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 I hungered for more after reading The Celestine Prophecy, The Tenth Insight, and The Secret of Shambala . . . unfortunately, this book did not satisfy my hunger.  I had the feeling that, unlike the masterpieces that came before it, this book was written just to satisfy a demand. Perhaps my expectations were out of line - I wanted practical and applicable information, and what it offered seemed shallow and scattered 
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 Robert A. Heinlein, a leading writer of science fiction, wrote "A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method."  In Stranger in a Strange Land, we're introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on Mars. These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF 
 Using new evidence from the Abrams papers, but failing to examine massive recent declassifications of Nixon's and others' papers and tapes, including Soviet, Chinese, and Vietnamese documents and accounts, Sorley essentially restates the mythical stab-in-the-back theory; namely, that the antiwar movement and the politicians betrayed a victorious army.  Readers need to read Kimball's Nixon's Vietnam War and The Vietnam War Files; David Elliott's The Vietnamese War; Kenton Clymer's The United States and Cambodia; Luu Van Loi and Nguyen Anh Vu's Le Duc Tho-Kissinger Negotiations; and Ang Chen Guan's Ending the Vietnam War 
  OK, so I'm a Zhang Ziyi fan.   Not a huge fan, but enough that, one day, out of sheer boredom, I decided to get this movie while surfing through Amazon.com.  The best part about this movie is that Zhang Ziyi is in it.  And that's it.  This is not one of her better movies, definitely.  The plot is not that difficult to figure out.  What is hard to figure out is how and why things happen the way they do in the movie, since nothing much makes sense.  What the filmmakers have tried to do here is disguise an incoherent and unrealistic plot as film noir, by using dense layers of atmosphere.    The story starts in 1928 in Manchuria, with Zhang's character, Cynthia, at the end of a love affair with a Japanese man, Itami, who is heading back to Japan.   Zhang appears in classic schoolgirl dress with pigtails.  In the next scene, her brother, who is involved in some sort of newspaper or anti-Japanese organization, gets murdered by a pro-Japanese terrorist. Tears from Zhang Ziyi in both scenes.     Cut to 1931, in Shanghai.  We meet Szeto, and his girlfriend Yiling.  Like an old war movie cliché, this brief scene of their happiness together is meant only to set up Yiling's tragic death in the next scene.  Szeto leaves on a brief trip, and then on his return, as he hurriedly leaves the train, he accidentally grabs the jacket of a Purple Butterfly operative (presumably a professional brought in to perform the assassination of the Japanese agent Yamamoto).  Mistaken for the real assassin by the other Purple Butterfly members waiting at the train station, they hand Szeto a briefcase containing info on Yamamoto and his organization, and then chaos and shooting breaks out.  The original assassin, realizing that Szeto has taken his jacket, chases after him, and is mistaken for an enemy by the other Purple Butterfly operatives, who kill him.  Szeto is packed into a car by the Purple Butterfly operatives as they make their escape.  Yiling, who has gone to the train station to meet her boyfriend, chases after Szeto, and is shot by Cynthia, who has been watching the scene unfold.  Cynthia shoots some other people also, all to help cover the escape of the Purple Butterfly operatives who have Szeto in the car.  Just three years later, Cynthia has become a seasoned Purple Butterfly operative, with the look of a mature young woman.    Confused?  Baffled? That's only the first quarter of the movie!  Like I said, it's not hard to figure out what is happening in the movie.  What's harder to figure out is how and why things happen the way they do.  How does a schoolgirl get from Manchuria to Shanghai and in just three years is involved in killing people in public places?  Just what the heck is the Purple Butterfly organization?  Their goals and methods seem to be more along the lines of a quasi-governmental death squad rather than a resistance/liberation/terrorist organization.  But the movie states later on explicitly that they are not affiliated with the government or any other organization.  Why arrange to have this meeting and hand-off of a crucial mission assignment in a crowded, chaotic train station?  Why have the only form of identification be this non-descript suit with a Purple Butterfly over the left chest?  It seems almost to be a parody of spy movie clichés to have this sort of Mission Impossible style mission assignment go wrong like this.    The rest of the movie goes along similar lines.  The pacing of the movie is excruciatingly slow.  There is very little dialogue in this movie.  Much of the movie is filled up by long tracking shots of people walking from point A to point B to point C, as well as long close-up shots of their facial expressions.  I'm guessing that these boring interludes are meant to convey some sort of a Deep Meaning.   I got more deep meaning out of this movie, in a much shorter time, by watching it in Fast Forward mode.  8x speed was about right - I could still read the subtitles at that speed.     A few other comments:    A particularly odd feature of this movie that I noticed was that the three main male characters have this ectomorph body type that just isn't seen much anymore in either Western movies or in the Chinese martial arts movies, where the male actors are built more sturdily.   These are REALLY skinny guys, with some seriously narrow shoulders.  In a number of shots, their heads look to be much larger than their torsos, making them look like bobble-head dolls.    The final scenes are from classic film clips of war atrocities and other carnage inflicted on the Chinese civilian population by the Japanese invaders.  This is heavy duty stuff, and remains an unsettled issue in Asia to this day, a source of deep anger among the Chinese people, and continuous denial by the Japanese.  It's too important of a subject to be casually tossed in at the end of such a lightweight and confused movie as this one.  
 The content of this book should have been the informercial for this book.  Although I understand the need for self promotion.....this book goes way overboard. Everything has been said before and at the end you feel like this book was geared for these two mens' fans and not people who are really looking for ways and means to get out of the rat race.  Hey Robert! We know about your other books and your game.  Donald, we know about your show.  Its great that those things made you rich but we want books with less fluff and less talk about your crap!!!! Honestly, if you havent been living under a rock for the last ten years, this book is a BIG waste of time and money!! 
 Why would a skid row alcoholic CHOOSE to live (and eventually die) in that condition?  Why would an otherwise caring mother CHOOSE to abandon/sell/prostitute her kids for drug money?  Why would a decent, hardworking father CHOOSE to gamble away his life's work and his family's security?    Would anyone voluntarily engage in any behavior that is so clearly self-destructive?  Would anyone in complete control of their faculties promise a child or spouse, with complete sincerity, never to indulge again only to let them down again later that very same day?  No!    It's not as simple as Schaler would have you believe, or as simple as the minds of the reviewers who agree with him.  Many with FIRST HAND experience trying to quit any addicive behavior have fallen time and time again, only to eventually find their liberation in AA.  It's insanity to assert that an alcoholic in the throes of their addiction would choose to wake up malnourished, with violent shakes, a pounding head, a failing liver, and soaked in two or three of their own bodily fluids.  And do it over and over again knowing full well the inevitable and devastating consequences.  At the very least, any MD will tell you that once physical dependence is achieved serious or even fatal consequences will arise if a substance like alcohol is withdrawn.  Doesn't sound to me like the addict has much of a choice in that situation.  Aside from one or two (very  hostile) reviewers here, it appears that those who agree with this author really have no first hand experience with the issue.  I could easily say that cancer was not painful, but I guess I would defer to those who have suffered with the disease.  Talk with people who've been there and experienced this first hand before you buy what this guy is trying to pass off as fact.  
 This book is definately for the beginner and was of no use to me. I have only been working as an importer for about a year and found the book useless. I would recommend it only for the novice. If you have any experience at all you have already heard this information 
 For many years Crews has been one of my favorite novelists; his personal life is an astonishing example of how endurance can conquer tragedy.  Futhermore, the early '90s books, BODY and THE KNOCKOUT ARTIST had him back  on the track he had cut with the early novels.  Unfortunately, the same can  not be said for this near travesty.  MULCHING, as an idea, has great  promise, but the work reads like a rough draft.  The author wants so badly  for the audience to embrace the bizarre protagonists of this book, that he  sacrifices plot and often sense to accomodate them.  Rather than a scathing  sendup on American business, MULCHING becomes a parody of its own ideas, a  product without substance 
 Following up a critically acclaimed debut is probably one of the hardest things that an artist can do, and more often than not, the album falls well short of expectations, because they're so highly elevated.  "Whip-Smart" is a decent, albeit somewhat inconsistent album, but its pales in comparison to "Exile in Guyville", and that unfortunately is how it will always be thought.  Probably the most important thing about "Whip-Smart" is that its not Exile Part 2, while some songs maintain that sort of lo-fi sound/overt lyric gig that the previous record got so much mileage from ("X-Ray Man", "Crater Lake"), the album actually does best when it drifts further away from the territory of Exile-- from the noise guitar over the familiar melody of "Chopsticks" to the haunting, moody, "Shane', where the tension is almost palpable to the brilliant, chugging "Jealousy".  Like Exile, it excels when the tension is at its highest, unlike Exile, its a lot brighter sounding.  Still, for all the good stuff on here, it sounds like Phair wasn't quite ready to issue a followup.  Several experiments in different veins sound incomplete ("Alice Springs"), fall apart ("Support System", "Go West") or are plain irritating ("Cinco de Mayo", "May Queen").  Its got its moments, but "Whip-Smart" is largely disposable-- start with Phair's debut, "Exile in Guyville", its everything its regarded as 
 I want to like Rickie Lee like I enjoyed Pirates, but this is not even close. Disappointing overall 
 Where's the content in this magazine.  ADs...ads...ads.  They try and make themselves out to be a great golf travel magazine, but I have seen much better in other publications.  I agree with the woman from England...Links loads up on these inserts.  I like to read a magazine like The Golfer, where they travel all over the world and review spectacular courses from the Carribbean to New Zealand 
 Liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money. Thought it'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else. But instead i've paid and never received it. I haven't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else, so this is the first chance i've had to even say i've been ripped off. They may eventually send it but it's not likely at this point, it's been a couple months now 
 Buyer beware. After paying for this book, the DVD-rom will prompt you to pay another US$30 for 80 additional exercises. That's a hidden expense which is not mentioned in the product description. This is wrong. I suppose for a book which is not intended for the beginner, the author assumes that you have the extra cash to spend on the additional exercises 
 A perusal of this book reminds me of a UK television show on which James "The Amazing" Randi, pretending to be a "medium," brilliantly and devastingly showed just how easy it is to be fooled by those who claim to talk to our dead relatives for us.  It seems that the need to believe, the craving to hang on and not let go, is powerful enough to bypass logic and rational thinking in our poor benighted species.  I would urge anyone considering laying out their hard-earned money to this or other "mediums" to do a little research into the "cold reading" trick and how it works.  There are many ways to deal with grief and loss that do not involve superstition, credulity or hefty amounts of cash.   
 Skepticism  can be healthy, but this book is an error-filled celebration of hollow, misleading cynicism delivered with a surprising level of shallowness and lack of detail.  Sure this book points out some "legitimate" frauds and hoaxes, but it does a lot of damage and leads people astray by suggesting that a lot of things are frauds and hoaxes that are not. It seems that Mr. Randi concludes that anything and everything he doesn't understand or have proof of is a fraud or hoax. One example: acupuncture.  Never mind that thousands,  if not millions of people have been helped and healed by acupuncture, but even the American Medical Association has concluded that it is a legitimate medical therapy. But Randi includes it in his list of frauds and hoaxes.   There are many other examples where Randi errs and misleads, or simply does not understand and chooses to cast aspersions (p on) what he is woefully ignorant about. In some cases he cites individuals who have supposedly exposed frauds or disproven claims and theories, but the reader is left with little or no details to assess the claims of the "fraud buster."    In other cases, a supernatural feat is presumed to have been disproven simply because someone else has managed to appear to replicate the supernatural feat by using sleight-of-hand or other trickery.    Not everything that is real and true can or needs to be proven by science or  proven to Mr. Randi. (A large portion of the history of science, in fact, is a history of proving that what science once concluded was unreal or unprovable is in fact real.)  If you accept on face value  everything that Mr. Randi wants you to accept, your life will be much poorer for it.   This book will provide great reassurance for people who don't want to believe in anything other than their egos. As stated above, this book is a great example of where skepticism has fallen victim to cynicism and that makes this book more harmful than helpful.  To a great extent,  I am very surprised and sorry to conclude, this book itself is a fraud 
 Let me say at the outset that I am not a macroevolutionist.  However, Morris' simplistic caricature of biologists ("Darwin's theory of evolution is universally accepted among biologists", p3) is far from the only factor that makes this a disappointing book.  Morris is simplistic and repetitive, and in addition to the typo's already mentioned by other reviewers), there are several examples of outright contradictions and misinformation that leave me scratching my head.  On page 21, Morris states that "carbon-nitrogen dating...can rarely be used to determine the ages of rocks in geological formations."  In fact, it cannot be used to date rocks at all, only organic materials.  On page 25, Morris states that "The solar system is full of such [organic] chemicals, including amino acids-the components of proteins..."  I am not an organic chemist, but to my knowledge none of the amino acids found in the proteins of living things have been found anywhere else in the solar system.  If they have, it would certainly be in very limited places and quantities, not littered about the whole solar system, as Morris implies.  In addition, only 6 pages later, Morris states:  "Localized areas rich in organic chemicals are found in the fossil record.  These chemicals must have been produced by microbes of some kind."  Gee, I thought you just said that the solar system was full of them!  On pages 33-34, Morris states:  "It should not be imagined that they [the mammals] survived because they were somehow better adapted than the dinosaurs."  This statement directly contradicts the principle of natural selection, which is the guiding light for evolution and is even accepted in a general sense by creationists.  On page 44, Morris attempts to defend evolution by saying:  "Although many different kinds of genetic codes are theoretically possible, all organisms use the same one."  He uses this as an argument for macroevolution.  However, the logic behind it is fallacious, for the following reason:  genetic code can be (and is) viewed as a language.  As a creationist, it is perfectly reasonable to me that the Grand Author of Life would use the same language to code the information in all living things, just as most earthly authors write all of their works in a single language.    On page 45, under the heading:  Evolution is a Fact", Morris states:  "The idea that life on Earth has been evolving for 3.5 billion years is not a theory.  It is the only possible interpretation of the numerous different kinds of evidence that scientists have been discovering for well over a century."  Thank you, Reverend Morris, Pastor of the Darwinian Orthodox Church.  However, on page 62, Morris states:  "If scientific ideas ever became dogmatic, then no new discoveries could be made."  If ever a contradiction existed, surely this is it.    On pages 56-57, Morris gives the beginning of a reasonably plausible explanation for the evolution of an eye, until he says:  "Finally, full, complex eyes develop", thereby skipping the most problematic part:  the 20+ step biochemical process that occurs in complex eyes from the time that light strikes the retina until an impulse is sent to the brain.  (See Darwin's Black Box, by Michael Behe, if you want a fair discussion of the difficulties that the human eye poses for the theory of macroevolution).    I could go on and on, but I will conclude by adding that I could forgive most of the evolutionary dogma (which is, after all, almost universal in books written by evolutionists) were the book not incredibly redundant, error-filled, and simplistic.  I got a little bit out of the part about evolutionary psychology, but that it about it.     
  I find it hard to believe this is the same band that created Cruelty And The Beast.  I liked all COF up to this release right here. Cradle hasn't been a Black Metal band since Cruelty, and after that they still at least had some good tunes. I can't believe they released this with a straight face. If they keep up down this road, they'll be seen on Jay Leno before you know it. It's bad enough they were on Viva La Bam on MTV, a show that pushes Billy Idol and other posers not worth mentioning here. The good thing about this? There's still great Black Metal bands around that aren't playing to 'the teenage crowd." If this has you down listen to these Gods: Mayhem, Tsjuder, Gorgoroth, Darkthrone, Blood Ritual, even Dimmu Borgir hasn't strayed this far into teen/mtv land.   
 I haven't actually read the book, but the title says it all...the author doesn't understand economics!  Wealth is made by the ingenuity of the people who seek to produce better goods and services that would satisfy consumer demand.  Ingenuity is sadly lacking in China, now, or ever. Look at any Chinese invention, and see its real development only when the Europeans got hold of it, from razor blades to paper money.  Not convinced, look at patent production in China. It is eclipsed by most US states or European nations.  Sorry, no sale 
 Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' "exploitation" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film.  Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the source for many of those Milano skin pics.  After TV's Who's the Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress, so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time.   Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd played in Who's the Boss.  In other words, she wanted to "grow" as an actress.  So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body.  Mission accomplished.  Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin.  A virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look), but still, a virgin.  A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn't know why.  Here's why: Milano is the reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love.  Some 300 years ago, a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy.  Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has three nights to rekindle her love for him.  If so, they will live forever as vampires.  If not, he dies and loses her forever.  Why the sudden three-night deadline?  Why not.  The plot and motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn.  Milano wanders around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams, even daydreams.  Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's so pure.  Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by others.  Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action.  Other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action.  Amid all this wandering there's much carnal action, and more carnal dreaming.  Occasionally, Kemp kills someone for dissing Milano.  John Stanley (in his Creature Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a "meandering, almost formless script."  Kemp has the best lines.  Like many vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love.  His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character.  He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.  Lewis's small part is pointless to the "story."  All that's required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the wait.  Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on.  All of the above three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her boyfriend.  At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the "tragic" star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  One senses that director Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material.  However, this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Milano is no Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman.  For that matter, none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts.  And the budget just isn't there.  The strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than utilize.  How low was the budget?  Listen, I was an extra on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire.  (In both instances, I kept my clothes on.)  I worked one day on Embrace of the Vampire.  Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits.  But let me tell you an "inside story" on the making of this film:  We were shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip.  The extras were divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota).  This was during my nonunion days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which we were paid in cash and wrapped.  The Modesto extras were still working when we left.  Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?  I also wondered, and so I asked one.  I was told they were from an acting class in Modesto, California.  They had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a "class assignment."  In other words, they were PAYING to come to work.  There's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra.  It's neither glamourous nor difficult.  And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY EASY to come by.  The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras.  I did it for the cash, and because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling months).  NEVER PAY for the "chance" to be an extra, not in Los Angeles.  I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times, but wised up after a few months.  My guess is the producers of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost.  I know this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were not getting paid to be on the film.  Another inside story: Someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member.  She was near tears because it had sentimental value.  Never leave anything of value lying around on a set.  And some trivia: John Stanley says this film was "originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries," but on the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.  Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely.  If you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.  Dozens of better vampire films.  Even many superior erotic vampire films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind.  But if you're looking for Milano nudies, this is the film to see. 
 The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!"  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.    A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clichï¿½.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.    Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.  Enough said there.  My advice, watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.' 
 This is a cheap made in asia transfer to DVD, certainly not worth the price. Advertised subtittles are not included.  I wonder if MGM is aware of that release and if their copyrights were properly protected. I would suggest that Amazon take this item off their catalog. Conclusion: don't get fooled, don't buy! 
 A friend once said to me, "If you want a glossy that is a no brainer then get Vogue!"  How right she is, despite having glorious photography, fashion models that daren't stand sideways or you wouldn't be able to see them and the occasional good article in it, I have to admit I find Vogue too pretentious.  Vogue wants to be the voice of fashion, the voice of the high brow media but its clientele are the likes of you and me, ordinary people who can't afford to live the high life they are portraying on its gloss filled pages.  Personally I'd rather spend my money on a movie ticket, I get to see a good thriller, sci-fi, romance etc, etc I don't have to know about the substence abuse and emotional demons that haunt a particular actor's life, I'm just interested in enjoying myself for a couple of hours before I go back to my hard working life in the real world.  Vogue is trying to sell me a dream that I don't really want to buy into, never had a penchant for selling my soul to the devil,  it's gets two stars though because the photography is really superb, shame about the rest of it though 
 I ordered the DVD of Damn Yankees to watch on TV for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day I ordered it. I paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the CD of only music! I don't think I will order from Amazon again, it was my first time and probably my last.   Liz Snyde 
 I had heard a few songs from Songbook in the store, and decided to try this 'live' album.  Unfortunately, this was quite disappointing.  Nothing of the magic that was Songbook.  Capable note-wise, Cassidy's delivery is however, very unmoving here.  It was, and is, very annoying, that I keep imagining this was all sung by Ann Wilson (of rock band Heart).  But this is the wrong kind of music for a voice like that; i.e. she doesn't sound good live 
 MacArthur was a military genius and a charismatic leader with a fascinating life retold by many a historian.  This work fouses on a single aspect of his life and while doing so thoroughly, does so rather boringly.  It is analagous to writing a work about Mark Twain and focusing on how he dressed 
 "The Goal" was a great book but Goldratt is trying to continue to cash in on that success with this book.  It is remarkably poorly written and an absolute waste of time.  Not one new useful piece of knowledge in this book 
 It's wonderful, in a way, when a person writes a book whose predictions turn out to be completely wrong.  (Less wonderful when people keep buying his nonsense!)  A review of this book can be very brief -- just two points need be made:  1. There wasn't a great depression in the 1990s (to the posters who say there was a "recession" in the early 90s, I say: the unemployment rate in the US during the real Great Depression was 25% at its peak.  It never cracked 6.5% in the 1990s.  A mild recession does not a depression make, nor does it justify the title or apocalyptic tone of this book.)  2. Had the US adopted Batra's recommended policies -- dramatic increases in trade restrictions, etc. -- there WOULD have been a depression.  One of the central causes of the real Great Depression was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which increased tariffs dramatically.  Batra proposed similar measures in this book.  In other words, in order to prevent a depression that never came, Batra argued that we ought to adopt measures that caused an actual depression in the past 
 I love Linda Howard books.  I always look forward to her releases and this book was a gross disappointment to say the least.  I think the characters are not developed well, and the relationship between Cal and Cate occurred too fast.  The story was rushed and I'm sure Linda could have done much better writing on this book.  
 Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies.  Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way.  The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action.  Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?).  This is going to go down as the "Star Wars Prequel" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love. 
 i wouldn't have such a big problem with rap if they didn't call it music.  that's like calling the teletubbies 'theater'.  a bunch of guys talking to a beat is not music, it's poetry with a rhythm.  and these guys don't give a f*ck what they are writing about, all they care about is the loot.  so f--- all of these rap artists taking up space on the tv and radio.  progressive 4 ever 
 I cannot believe I paid money for this book. We need information about ecotourism, particularly in the developing world. But the author shows no first-hand knowledge. She includes a lot of reports and obviously attends many policy meetings. But outside of the classroom, I do not think this book is of much use 
 it's a so-so film with Rourke in the IRA. Some good stuff. Look for Anthony(Stewart Head) as Rupert(note: Anthony Stewart Head portraits another Rupert...Rupert Giles on the TV show Buffy The Vampire Slayer)so, now you know. but this one is so-so like I sai 
 okay. has historical relevance as a memoir of an Afrikaaner boy growing up in S. Africa. 
 I had to read this wack siht for class and I must say, overrated garbage! why does everyone think that just cause a novel is pre-1900s its such a CLASSIC. smh. madame bovary lost 
 This book is a nightmare; thoroughly confusing. Authors do not know how to teach! Brigham & Company will take 30 pages to explain a concept that can be done in 2 pages. I used this book for my finance class for my MBA; this one is not worth the money or your time. 
 Layard gives a superficial overview of some economic and psycological research. He uses this research to advocate governmental management of happiness, which is the primary theme of the book. Whether or not you agree with that idea, this book's flawed logic and rambiling prose is unilkley to convince anyone either way.   Layard proposes several policies intended to increase happiness including prohibition of vice, increased taxation, redistribution of wealth, and general intervention in the economy. Naturally, his authoritarian proposals for collective happiness largley ignore individual rights and freedom. They also ignore the fact that similar policies have failed when attempted by governments throughout history.   What is clear is that if the department of happiness comes to be, the central planner's idea of happiness won't be mine, and it won't be yours either. 
 Don't waste your time or money on this book.  It was about as interesting as watching paint dry!  Maybe Danielle Steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out 
 Repetitive magical drivel for people who want to stick in a rut. Better to get a life instead 
 In this award-winning novel for young people, all the black people (with possibly one exception) are honest, kind, hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and good looking.  All the white people (with one or two exceptions) are cruel, dishonest, malevolent red-necks, who persecute the "colored people" for no reason at all.  Historically, there's some truth to the setting and events, and we all admit that blacks were sometimes persecuted in the past.  But that was then.  This is now.  Times have changed, but young people are still required to read this one-sided tripe.  Let's hope that English teachers will eventually recognize this poorly written novel for what it is. 
 Rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite.  Perfectly exemplifies the great post-modern con.  A chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed, so much like a certain nostradomus.  There are two principle types of literay work:  1. That which is to be read. and of course  2. That which is to be carted about, the title clearly visible, with a look of supreme smugness upon the owner's face.  Gravity's Rainbow is quite obviously a work of the latter category.  You see, I've come to the think of myself as something of an amateur post-modern poet; here is an example of my work:  Ball, Kite, wolf, sky, space, heart, moon, expand, window, flowing, profound, pompous, gravity's rainbow.  You see i'm quite the literary genius, somebody give me an award!!!  What you fools fail to realize is that the post-modern style is simply a tool enabling those of simple mind to veil their lack of true artistry behind absurdity 
 I bought this album unheard because I was such a fan of Prince.  Bad move.  I agree with the last reviewer.  I tried to like it.  I really did.  But, there is nothing on here worth listening to, let alone dancing to.  The subject matter didn't bother me (he's certainly been controversial before), but I listened to the entire album straight through and couldn't tell where one song began and another ended.  Bored now.  Only buy this if you're a completist 
 There's a reason you don't know much about his earlier career.  If you want to listen to a sucky indulgent late 60's California band, get QuickSilver Messenger Service first album.  At least Sailor had a minor hit (Living in the USA).  I would be more lenient if this was the first album.  Seeds of potential can be heard on some of the tracks, but he's got a long way to go. He must have been connected, I would not have let him record another album after the first.  But, good thing they did because he was much better in the 70's.  
 Well this book is fine if you want the 8th grade version of US history. Of course, I myself doubt the accuracy of the book. If you look on page 141 you'll find a lovely picture of "Stalin" which tells you the man in the center of the photo is Stalin. I nearly died laughing because any idiot could see that the man in the bright white outfit standing in the center was not Stalin. Stalin is actually standing two men away to his right. I wonder if in fact this was done on purpose, so that a person just glancing at the image would simply view Stalin as this strong dictator that we must fear, instead of the rather weak person he looks like in the photo (not that Stalin was weak of course...)  Bottom line: I don't trust the book. It's a whole lot of propaganda and bias. But if you can read it with that in mind, it works fine as a referrence to dates and whatnot 
 I really liked Death Cab until I bought this-yuck! If you enjoy a whole DVD of a band complaining about how hard it is to be on the road and singing the same songs every night-then go for it! They seem like a bunch of pretentious jerks-this did not help their image. I know its so tough touring the world playing the  music you love, but don't make a whole dvd devoted to your whining...yuck again 
 This is an interesting Seuss book. The moral that it is trying to portray is good, but the story is pretty lame and it doesn't seem to flow as nicely as most Seuss books 
 I feel for the HSPs in the world.  In many respects, I am one.  However, this book had a pervasive pointlessness to it.  Despite the promising title, the book offers little of substance.  What's worse, it thoroughly confounds two separate traits: emotional sensitivity and sensitivity to one's environment.  The two are vastly different and jamming them into one trait, "sensitive," misses much ground for exploration.  I was excited to start the book the first time I started it...and I never got very far.  I started it again a year or so later wondering, "why was it again that I never got very far in this book?"  I figured that out rather quickly.  I doubt I'll pick up this book a third time 
 Why was this ever made? Just to make fans of the original mad? Rod Serling is rolling over in his grave. When I originally saw this in Burbank, CA, we were screaming and groaning at the screen 
 In a course, this book was used as teaching material in a class for computer security.  The read, reminded me of speaking software to a hardware engineer.  Since the hardware engineer is coming from another level, the experience was like talking DOWN to the reader.  The author seemed to want to "impress" us with his "knowledge".  Luckily, we were fortunate to have an instructor that could translate for the class.  Had to use other manuals to replace what the author, may have tried to relay 
 There is a common assumption, particularly among the musical literati, that if a piece is novel, obscure, extremely simple, unchromatic or simply weird, it must, by definition, be quality material. Sheer novelty trumps quality. I am reminded of having to hunker down at the Symphony as the conductor launches into an extended "explanation" on why this next piece may not have a melody, discernable beat, nor employ "ordinary" instruments, yet is still a fine piece of art.  (Chances are the majority of comments will be along the lines of, "What in the world was that thing with bongo drums & basketballs?"   I am the first to admit the artistry, perhaps musicality of Cage even when he takes himself AND his music too seriously.  At least we did not have to "listen" to 4'33". One reviewer was correct - this is perhaps the most accessible offering of the entire ouevre. It is...interesting in a childish sort of way, sort of like someone who learns that hitting notes on a keyboard results in sounds or better, is playing just to hear the sounds that can be produced. DREAM perfectly expresses the mood of this CD (which is wonderful as party backgroup music) with its enigmatic, almost shy explorations. The tracks are united by an almost wordless fear of being closely examined. A few contain a nice rhythmic drive, others remind one of that godawful New Age stuff heard on public radio occasionally. The CD is compelling only if one takes their music with a huge dollop of tenuousness 
 After seeing Feet of Flames, LOTD and Riverdance, other shows are hard-pressed to even come close to the adrenalizing delivery of the aforementioned productions.    One of the main characters in the show, an older gent, walks around the stage throughout the production which starts out as simply awkward because everyone around him is dancing and he's pretty much a statue.  It eventually becomes flat out annoying because in a show full of Irish dancers, he does nothing but grimace and stand around.  It's unfortunate the talents of Jean Butler and Colin Dunne came up with something as weak as DODG.  You watch each number with disappointment hoping the next will turn things around but it never happens.  The story had potential but this show becomes nothing more than soda without the fizz.  No wonder it died financially and never reached the States 
 This product performs poorly. Within 1 month of receiving it, water no longer flowed through the coffee. After complaining to Krups, sending it for repairs and finally getting a replacement, I am still not very happy with it. The frothing part is unpredictable in its creation of quality foam. Krups did better with their older model of this machine 
 I have to admit, with great shame, that I didn't realize how bad this was until the sex passages started. There, the book totally reveals itself as another of those Danielle Steele like  easy-reading "romantic" books for housewives. The book is made of extremely intense micro-chapters, all of them contain an essential part of the story, necessary to the book: the skeleton of the history is the boom itself. It is extremely predictable and the characters act childishly like in some kind of bad soap opera. The main issues of this book are supposed to come from long ago but all of them resolve in 5 minutes scenes in extremely stupid conversations 
 Shame on Routledge for touting as a centenary edition this dog, riddled with egregious typos ("simiotics"? "ernestly"?), whose footnotes refer one to pages on which that which is alleged to have taken place does not, in fact, take place. I like the intros, and the very spacey Micky James foreword. But Routledge does not deserve the $18.95 I gave them for this book, which is, apparently, in the public domain, and which I can read, without typos, online. Shame!!!! 
 This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense.  The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works.  Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before.  In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene.  To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was  actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing  questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere 
  A history of California, from the founding years through to Gov. Schwarzenegger, was always an ambitious undertaking, one fraught with difficulties, starting with how to approach it. A large, diverse state with a complex history, there are only a few options:  compile an encyclopedia, focus on a few defining events, or create lists.  Unfortunately, Starr takes the last approach, keeping the book to a short 350 pages, but filling those pages with one or two sentences on every event and every major figure in California history.  Unfortunately, while comprehensive, the disjointed style and lack of detail on any topic make for painful reading.  Nearly every paragraph deserves its own book or at least its own chapter. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 rates 3 paragraphs.    Here's one example taken at semi-random:  "The previous evening, a drunken miner had tried to break into Josefa's cabin, where she was living with her common-law husband, also a Mexican.  Upbraided by Josefa the next day for his conduce, the miner called her a whore.  Enraged, she stabbed him to death."  This was the most interesting passage on the page I opened at random, but it certainly needs to be its own story.  As a novel or movie, this event could succeed in illustrating life during that period in California history, but as half a paragraph, it's just more event in a long list of things that happened.  When Starr turns to arts and literature, the effect is even worse, pages packed with names of artists and writers.  Starr seemed to feel the need to include every writer who ever even visited San Francisco.  Further, parentheticals in nearly every sentence and a reliance on passive voice make the book feel as if it was dictated by a PBS narrator. Though cleared of footnotes and written in large text on small pages to appeal to a general audience, Starr is clearly a historian rather than a writer. Possibly this would have been a more interesting book had it been written by a journalist or novelist rather than an academic, though I expect that a journalist or novelist would realized that this undertaking was impossible and would instead have focused on one particular person or event.  In the end, I felt that I learned more about California history by reading a book focused on a particular theme - for example, Dennis McDougal's Privileged Son, which in the process of telling the history of the LA Times through multiple generations of the founding Chandler family, goes a good job telling the history of Los Angeles itself.  Overall, this book is far too dry to recommend it to someone looking for an overview of California history, and too cursory for anyone looking to learn anything about one particular time or place. 
 I sincerely expected much more from the author of "Guns, Germs and Steel" than this booklet that thrives on the trivia of evolutonary psychology. It's  obious why is sex fun- to encourage reproduction - and I expected the author went beyond this self-evident fact. Bit it didn't. And, excuse me, Dr. Diamond, how you account for gay sex in your reasoning? Homosexuality is totally  overlooked, yet it's one of the mayor puzzles of  human sexuality- and of sexuality in general. Dr. Diamond, I'm very disappointed 
 Margaux with an x is about a young lady who seems to have it all. Beauty,Popularity and can do about anything without getting into trouble at home. Yet she is not happy she holds a dark secret that happened to her when she was young.She is tired of every boy drooling over her and wanting to date her and most having no content to them.  She has a gambler as a father and a mother who just watches television all day. Her life takes a different turn when she meets Danny. He is the total opposite of all the guys she has dated. He is a year behind her in high school he is thin and is not shapely, yet they both start a bond with each other. The book was interesting but after awhile I got tired and could not keep up with the constant bantering and sarcasm of the main characters 
 I must confess I did not read the entire book word for word because it struck me as being pure common sense. I would not recommend the book unless you are just starting out in life and do not have much experience dealing with people 
 This book had no focus, was choppy, and really doesn't help you to understand Iran - if anything, it confuses you even more.  The first half of the chapters is the story of Ali Hashemi, a young Iranian boy who studies at a madreseh and eventually becomes a prominent mullah in the town of Qom.  Not fantastic, but that part's okay.  What kills the book is the second  half of the chapters: a sloppy, unfocused, confusing, rambling account of Iranian history.  The book goes into such detail on some aspects of Iranian history (for example, providing detailed biographies of historical figures) that you can't grasp the overlying structure.  This detail would be fine in a purely nonfiction book on the history of Iran, but coming in a book with such a jumbled format, a general synopsis would have been more appropriate. The history portion attempts to relate to the previous "fictional" portion of the chapter, but in doing so the history isn't presented in a clear chronological order, leaving you befuddled as to what's happening when.  I had to read this book for a class and it was very painful.  Don't read it if you don't have to - stay far away 
 A waiste of money - Don't bother 
 The recording of this live music is one of the worst I've ever heard and rivals the quality on some bootlegs.  The guitars are way up and overpower everything else, including Paul's voice.  There's no transition between the songs - just wait 3 seconds and the next one starts.  Amateurish is the best way to describe this effort 
 This book was NOT FUNNY.  Anybody who compares it to Woody Allen is hurting Woody!  He wrote about his imagined friendship with President Kennedy; not funny.  The Hansen's Christmas letter each year was not funny.  Even the discussion of Martha Stewart's vagina was not funny.  The book looked like it was trying too hard and totally missed the mark. The title could have been really funny and wasn't.  I bought it in the aiport and had a long plane ride and was really psyched to read it.  The book was lousy from beginning to end and I don't even recall anything funny in the entire book.  Don't waste your money.  See the show, but don't bother with such a lame book. I would have given it NO STARS, but the system wouldn't let me 
 This very good book gets only 1 star because of the poor quality of binding. A few months of (admittedly heavy) use is all it took for individual pages and whole sections to start falling out.  Otherwise, I generally agree with the previous review. It's a thorough introduction to the XQuery language with extensive reference and numerous examples. If it wasn't for the horrible production values I'd give it 5 stars 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 This volume is definitely not as good as the first.  Most of the skits included are not what I would call "best of" material.  With the exception of a few funny moments, this is an utter waste of time and money.  I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell's comedy, but he was short-changed with this DVD volume 
 I bought this edition for a bicycle trip across northern Laos, but was very disappointed with the very old and inaccurate information on Hua Phan Province in the northeast of the country. It's a remote region, and probably on few travelers' itineraries, but it was on mine. I felt let down that the authors didn't provide up-to-date coverage. Neither author even visited the province! That's not good enough 
 As others have said, this was a much-anticipated game. I played Caesar II and III and was extremely excited when I heard that IV was coming out.   What a letdown!   I didn't have any of the installation errors that others have mentioned, and I haven't had the game crash on me. However, the game is unplayable on my system - which is only a year old - unless I turn down 90% of the advanced graphics. By "unplayable", I mean ten seconds or more of waiting between the time you click with your mouse, and when the game responds. Even with the graphics turned down, I still get lag when the auto-save starts. As mouse-control is essential when building roads or aquaducts, this is aggravating in the extreme.  It appears that Sierra's programmers and designers put a lot of work into upgrading the graphics. Too bad I can't see them!  The interface is horrible and takes up the right half of the screen at 1280x1024 resolution. This means that you must rotate the map to build along the right edge. I much prefer the "tabbed" building interface of the other city-building games.  Although you can build roads along the diagonals in this game - which you couldn't in earlier versions - the interface is not smart enough to auto-rotate the buildings to fit along the roads. You have to click and drag to rotate buildings, and lag - even at the low graphics settings - can make this an exercise in frustration.  I dislike the new warehouse management panel. The sliders might look cool, but they're slow (lag!). I would've liked to see additional options for "only store basic goods", "only store luxury goods", etc. This would take some of the pain out of managing them. Trade ports are different also - you can't see prices!  It appears that some of the scenarios have hidden milestones that you have to meet in order to advance. In the one I'm playing right now, I'm stuck because my prosperity rating will not rise above 36 (50 required to win). I have over 30,000 denarii in my treasury, and have been turning a hefty profit (and meeting various demands from Rome) for at least eight years of game-time. I have met and exceeded all other requirements for victory, but prosperity continues to elude me. My city is almost completely automated by now - the only thing I do is respond to Rome's requests for goods or cash. My advisors have nothing helpful to say. It's not fun if I can't advance.  So while the game is pretty - from what I can see of it - it's got too many frustrations to be worth much more of my time 
 I can't believe after buying Rosle tools for years that the whisk I just got yeasterday is not made in Germany but China. On the label on the whisk it says China and yet in the review it says twice "Made in Germany".  Is anything by Rosle made in Germany anymore 
 I had read a review which I misinterpreted.  I sometimes wonder if my CD player is on the right speed.  I had remembered liking Bobby Bare songs back in the early 60's but the renditions are painfully slow.  
 Peter Singer, inspite of his poor usage of commas, tries to make the point that economics could out do and render politics small and mostly insignificant stave for adjustments of the Golden Straight Jacket.    I think that a point on how economics and trade policies also works as a psuedo-war or carrot and stick type of negotiation fodder.  Sanctions have long been used as a form of political tactic of agression or revenge but Singer fails to point this out.  Rather he tries to portray everyone on the planet as being a bunch of scared sheep who are unable to control anything in this ocean of chaos that he calls Capatalism with no heart.  Also, he explains the genisis of ethics as having congieled from mammal feelings and behaviors.  He then goes on to explain how those mammal traits are disctint from our closest non-human relatives.  How can he compare mammals to our closest non-human relatives?  It is pure nonsense!  Monkeys, pigs, dogs, horses and cattle are all mammals and are our closest non-human relatives!  This guy is a MORON!    Improving on that statement I will attack his stance on his "new ethic" that has spawned from our new technology and globalization.  I shudder at the very idea that one, or a few, nations should impose their new found ethics onto contradictory morals, laws and ethics of smaller and less developed nations.  For heavens sakes!  I think that Singer is a poor poor man who is misguided and confused.  I feel sympathy for him and for his readers.   One atmosphere? What is he talking about here? Are CFC's for real?  Well I guess there is no argument, scientifically, against Chlorofluorocarbons existing or being real.  Peter Singer is talking about everyone shares the Atmosphere.  What I disagree with him on is his comparison he used to point the blame of pollution at America.  On page 20 he said that one of Britain's nuclear plants leaked waste into the north sea and ruined shellfish and lobsters (and probably regular fish TOO) for Ireland and Norway too.  Norway got nuclear waste on its shores and when it took Britain to court for it, the "author" (like he could WRITE) tries to make the point that Kiribati could likewise sure America because its pollution caused global warming which then caused the ice caps to melt which then caused the sea levels to rise which THEN caused the sea to submerge Kiribati's mud homes and farms. Wow, I think that is a textbook example of the slippery slope fallacy and makes for one terrible comparison.  Britain's nuclear pollution was preventable, an accident (?) and was directly traceable to Britain whereas America is NOT the world's sole producer of pollution and there for is NOT solely responsible like Britain was.   God, I literally cannot read one page in this book without being outraged.  I read this book with a pen and I do not need a bookmark for all I need to do is start reading where my comments in the margin stop.   
 I really like Paul Colligan's website and podcasts about podcasting (both very highly recommended -- search on Google to find them), and I eagerly ordered a copy of this book, expecting some great information.  Frankly, I am very disappointed.  This book is nothing more than a poorly produced extended commercial, full of platitudes both general and inspecific.  This book explores a lot of general business philosophy, but provides little practical, applicable advice about how to really make any money in podcasting.  There are a *few* good ideas hidden in here -- but you have to wade through a *lot* of prose to find them.  Unlike some of the other excellent podcasting advice books in print (see Jason van Orden's "Promoting Your Podcast" and Walch/Lafferty's "Tricks of the Podcasting Masters"), this book just didn't meet my expectations -- which were admittedly high, considering the impressive pedigrees of the two authors.  Paul and Alex, you two are acknowledged experts in this field, and you can do a lot better than this book.  In addition, I was struck at how poorly organized and produced this book really is -- no titles for chapters (which makes sense, since there is little organization to the subject matter -- many of the chapters read the same), and no index.  There is, however, a lot of advertising tucked in here and there for services provided by Paul and Alex.  When I buy a book from industry experts, I don't want an infomercial -- I want real information.   I even went to the "member site" referred to in the book, and ran into technical problems when trying to access it.  Frustrating?  You bet.  My advice: skip this book, and go to Paul Colligan's excellent blog -- you'll find a LOT more useful information there 
 After reading the product description and looking at the photos I was ready to buy, but when it came time to select a size, I couldn't start. Without a sizing chart, I don't know which size to order, not for a unisex item 
 Ugh. Reminds me of that famous quote by Moliere:  "Writing is like prostitution. First you do it for love, and then for a few other close friends, and then for money."  She was sort of like a political version of Anais Nin, only, without the literary imagination or talent. But she has joined the ranks of the elect, and became one of the Kewl Kids, so, I guess that is why this Dog of a book got published 
 This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:  1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.    2.  The mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  The earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  A better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.    3.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.    4.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to "shiver", which is very frustrating.    Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.    Jim "Konedog" Koenig, astronomy buf 
 "Cloud 9" presents problems and situations that are often not discussed.  Such situations are gays, incest, and women's rights.  Churchill does a wonderful job at presenting the situations in a non-bias  manner.  However, many readers do not care about these issues, reguardless  of how they are presented 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 I love to read his books! This was a disappointment to me. The basic story is ok and I like Ed Eagle as a character but at every turn this was about men thinking with their organ. Mr.Woods you can do better than this stupidity and have over and over and over again. Skip this one, save your money, read anything else 
 At the beginning, the author states that she is taking some liberties with characters, etc., the usual things authors do in order to better tell the story. No issue there.  It can't be later than 1941 in the book when Moroccan forces invade and devastate a Black Forest village that the family has left just the day before. Now there were in fact Moroccan and Algerian forces attached to the French forces, but the invasion of Germany proper began end of 1944/beginning of 1945. It would have been that much later that Moroccans attacked anything in Germany. In WWII, the entire war changed in the meantime.  That does not take away anything from God's work and protection and the family's faith which is inspirational (albeit, sometimes more focused on the being an Adventist than a follower of Jesus Christ). However, taking liberties to the point that the personal story disconnects from history in general does more damage to the story than simplify anything.   I have not finished the book yet, and while the story itself has me curious about the rest, I wonder whether I would find more inaccuracies. I understand that such a story is hard to tell in all details, but when there are obvious things that are wrong, you are left wondering a bit 
 go for Frank Stitt's Southern Table which is what a real Southern cooking book should be. This book is very pretty, but not well written. It's simply kitschy, and the recipes are not good at all. I made several things from this book, and they did not work. I would not advise buying this book. I'm sorry, but Tanya Holland is not a 'real' chef, maybe one of those many people who write cookbooks and put in pretty pictures to sell it. Just my personal opinion 
 There are plenty of excellent Play Therapy books out there, this is not one of them.  Maybe it's just me, but a play therapy book should be way more user friendly.  I need quick access, color and... ART 
 First, I should say that I haven't yet heard any of the Oasis records made after this one. Like most people I got into Oasis (as well as Blur) during the Definitely Maybe/Morning Glory years. When I heard "Be Here Now" I couldn't help wondering if the band had lost its edge. I liked The Master Plan a lot, but as it was more a loose collection of B-sides than an album in its own right, I didn't read it as indicative of a specific musical direction.   By the time I bought a cassette of SOTSOG during an April 2000 trip to the UK, my Britpop tastes had moved on to Stereophonics, Belle & Sebastian and Badly Drawn Boy. I listened to that cassette in my rental car all during the trip. I wasn't crazy about it. I really liked a couple songs, but when I got back to the US I put the tape away and rarely ever listened to it until a few weeks ago.  So, my take on SOTSOG:  Noel Gallagher has always written trite lyrics, but the triteness was forgivable because his songs had great hooks and were loud and noisy and made you want to jump around. SOTSOG shows that when Noel goes mellow, his lyrics quickly go from innocuous to annoying - and these songs generally aren't hooky enough to compensate.   Letting Liam join the songwriting guild was not a smart remedial step; at this stage, Liam's simply a juvenile songwriter. I don't oppose the mellowing of Oasis, but if they are going to turn the noise down they're going to have to ratchet up the hook quotient or come up with some more sophisticated lyrics. Noel's mellow tunes on The Master Plan ("Going Nowhere", "The Masterplan") came closer to achieving this balance.  That said, the album has a few highlights. The Celtic raga-hymn "Who Feels Love" is one of the band's best songs, ever; since the CD-single of this song is more expensive than SOTSOG, the album is worth buying for this one song alone. Also, "Go Let It Out" is pretty much vintage Oasis, bright and crisp.  I like where Noel Gallagher is going. I'm interested to see if Oasis' post-SOTSOG output is better 
 The packaging for this product is unacceptable.  The first table I received was completely beat up/busted on every corner.  I sent it back only to recieve a second one in the same condition...poorly packaged and damaged beyond use.  I didn't even have to take it out the box...the damage was visible through the broken packaging everywhere.  The price with free shipping is the catch, but it is a game to see what you'll get.  I guess this is why they are $49.99.  You're lucky if you get one you can use.  I was not lucky 
 This is a poorly written, out-of-date book which would be devastating to any parent of a child recently diagnosed with autism. It presents a picture of despair and hopelessness which isn't even accurate. Copies should not  only not be bought, they should be destroyed 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 The gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people WOULD NOT take it back - said he'd had it too long.  I will never buy this product, nor work with this seller again.  HORRIBLE. 
 Whether you agree or not with Revel's views, and in large part I think I could be persuaded (by a more reasoned argument), his presentation carries the whiff of desperation that accompanies all ideologues and partisan hacks.  This book is no doubt very popular with people who already share its worldview. I came across it looking for a reasoned and reasonable presentation of viewpoints not necessarily my own. What I found instead was a book full of logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, straw men, and the worst of the rhetorical games that can be played.  If you want a cheerleader to get you pumping your fist in the air a la Rush Limbaugh or Al Franken or Michael Moore or Bill O'Reilly, then this book will be great for your enthusiasm, if not necessarily for your intellect.  If you're looking for a thoughtful exploration of the nature of America, her standing in the world, and the reflexivity of that relationship, look elsewhere. If you find it, please let me know, I'm still looking 
 I ordered this book hoping to find some good recipes for BBQing but instead I found a book that would you give part of the recipe and then you need the secret ingredient, cookshack's rib rub.  Most of the recipes require you to order different types of rubs from cookshack instead of giving you the information needed to make the rub.  
 I took the stat class using this book as a business major. Although this book had good problem sets using SAS and all, this book was very hard to understand. The examples and the way they explained it didnt help me to understand the material. If it wasn't my professor's lectures, I dont think my whole class could have handled the material. Also, as my Stat TA has told us, this book is not fit for many business students because it is so much in detail that it should be only used to Stat students. I know that there are other stat books that would fit business majors but I dont think this book is the one. 
 I find this show very boring. Like another reviewer said, all they do is travel to the recording studio, watch T.V., do laundry and fight over food. You might as well just watch your parents fight, kids. I mean, at the end of the day, they fight over food and who's grabbing the remote, don't they? They fight over who should do the laundry, right? All that's left is the recording studio part, but that's not very entertaining to watch for us.. 
 ick.  :) - i was impressed that hugh jackman had it all - good looks, acting and singing, but i was not impressed 
 AN extremely slanted version of some events in the 60's and 70's that may have involved the author.  He talks about drug dealing and glazes over some murders but over all a very boring read that drags on and on without point.  There are many many more books about bike gangs that are interesting.  Read those instead 
 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it 
 Professor Pollack, a pioneer of feminist criticism and art history, has written a classic in Vision and Difference.  This new edition has a cover with her surname in bold letters, Pollack, as if playing off her famous name.  An unsturdy introduction adds a page to the length of the book.    After careful study of both editions, one will find no textural additions to this edition.    The title has been changed by juxtaposing words so that the first edition does not appear along side this version. The first edition is titled  Vision and Difference: FEMININITY, FEMINISM and the Histories of Art.  Two words have been switched.  
 I am really disappointed with this book. It's packed full of broadly presented and common-sense information. Most of the advice the book recommends will come very natural to you. I've read 150 pages so far and haven't really learned anything. It's also divided by subject, not age, which results in the book approaching subjects very broadly.  It often gives the same advice for 1 and 3 year-olds,  and anyone who has ever been around these ages understands that this is not practical. A 1 year-old is barely off the bottle, can't communicate well, isn't potty-trained, and is barely learning to hold a spoon! Instead, I recommend other book, which offers a month-by-month guide -"What to Expect the Toddler Years" for more detailed info on illnesses, developmental milestones, nutrititional guidance, etc.  
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 This book contains reproducible mini-books, bingo cards, flash cards, some word search puzzles and fill-in activities.  In my opinion, the fill-ins are a bit too challenging.  I even had trouble with them.  The only thing in this book really "worth it" that I couldn't make as well myself, are the mini-books.  The mini-books each contain several different sight words, so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them 
 The most seemingly innovative part of Bruegmann's book is his attempt to create a history of sprawl.  His basic argument runs as follows: something vaguely resembling sprawl happened in ancient Rome and 18th-century Europe, therefore sprawl will forever be with us, therefore sprawl is unstoppable.  Bruegmann's argument fails because is that it totally ignores differences of degree. There is an enormous difference between   (1) a region where sprawl is just one lifestyle option among many and you can live an auto-free life in a city or a streetcar suburb (e.g. most of the United States in the 1920s, the NYC region today, and much of the rest of the world today)  and  (2) a place where buses stop running at rush hour and you need a car to be a functional member of society (e.g. some Sun Belt cities and most small towns).    It seems to me that situation (1) is indeed normal in an affluent society; situation (2) requires decades of bad public policies.     Moreover, Bruegmann makes concessions that eviscerate his argument.  On the one hand, he implies that sprawl is inevitable in an affluent society.  On the other, he admits that many metro areas have grown more compact in recent decades, and that cities are beginning to gentrify.  (I suspect that he was not quite sure whether he wanted to be balanced or to write a pro-sprawl polemic; sometimes he leans in one direction, other times not).  His attempt to deny government's involvement in sprawl is sometimes a bit silly.  In response to the argument that government-funded highways spread sprawl by making it easier to live in suburbs, he responds: "federal spending today goes more heavily per capita to central cities than to suburbs, primarily because of the enormous price tag of social security payments, which go primarily to an older population that remains disproportionately in the central cities."    First of all, this "analysis" is factually questionable: many cities actually have a slightly smaller over-65 population than their suburbs.  (For example, in Chicago, where Bruegmann lives, 10.3% of city residents are over 65, as opposed to 11.3% of all metro residents).   Second, highways affect where people live by making suburbs more convenient, while social security benefits benefit a suburban retiree as much as an urban retiree. (I suspect that they are most useful for whoever lives in a low cost of living area where your money goes farther- which means cities in some parts of the United States, suburbs in others).  Worst of all are the constant attacks against anyone who dares criticize the sprawl machine.  He constantly attacks sprawl critics as "elites."  This sort of "argument" exemplifies the ad hominem fallacy- attacking the person instead of the argument.    His attacks are as hypocritical as they are illogical; he brags about avante-garde architects who see "the spatial and ecological richness" of sprawl, and ignores the fact that a "road lobby" of construction companies and real estate interests generously funds politicians who favor suburban development and sprawl-generating expressways. It seems to me that these media star architects or large corporations are just as much of an "elite" as the environmentalists Bruegmann villifies.  Bruegmann's substantive discussion of the vices of sprawl is, by contrast, occasionally useful.  Where the data is uncertain, he (occasionally) says so; for example, he correctly suggests that there is no way to know whether more compact development would reduce fuel consumption enough to affect global warming, or how much of an effect sprawl has on taxes and spending.    But even in this part of the book, Bruegmann sometimes cannot resist the temptation to overreach: for example, he writes that "cause of [auto-induced air] pollution was neither sprawl nor the automobile itself, but, rather, the inefficient fuel source it used."  Of course, the "inefficient fuel source" only pollutes if it is actually placed in an automobile, and if the automobile is actually driven- both of which happen more often under sprawl.       
 1st, let me say that I LOVE (LOVE!!!!) the JLU seasons...and, I was VERY excited when I found out that these episodes were coming to DVD.  To my great disappointment, I found that Disc 3 (the one with Aquaman on the cover of the disc) would not play in ANY of my DVD players, including my computer DVD player.  I returned the item to Amazon, and Amazon replaced it in a flash.  Again, Disc 3 would not play in my computer DVD player, and it took several times of ejecting and reinserting the DVD into my standard DVD player to even start the disc.  I returned (sadly) the item again to Amazon who said that they have been experiencing numerous problems with this DVD edition.  So, sadly my wait continues....buyer beware.  I can understand a problem with one disc from one order...but to experience the SAME problem with the SAME disc from two different orders...that to me spells defective disc for all.  Anyone else out there have a problem with Disc 3 not playing??? 
 Sure there are other movies that have butchered their source material beyond recognition, but it's not even the butchering that's the problem. The problem comes when the director hits all the marks and completely misses the point of the book. Jan de Bont decided to take the atmospheric Haunting of Hill House and turn it into a carnival ride and give an easy explanation to the haunting. DePalma went and decided to tone down the racism in Bonfire of the Vanities. But those weird decisions to miss the point pale in comparison to Shlessinger's choice of turning a vicious novel into sentimental slop.  From the opening sequence with the tinkling piano music to the ending with Faye sighing at Tod's stupid rose, this movie sets out to jerk tears and make the viewer feel bad. Even if there wasn't a great book to be killing, this would be a terrible movie. But with Day of the Locust as a source material, the awfulness of this movie borders on the criminal. One imagines the book done right by a Quentin Tarantino or a Todd Solondz.  Where the book is fast, the movie is slow. Tod Hackett is supposed to be a fat cynical observer but Shlessinger decided to cast an anonymous pretty boy in his role. The casting choice is decidedly better with Donald Sutherland as Homer Simpson, but Sutherland is emoting way too much pain for the humor to come through. Every time you see him you want to kill yourself and his abuse at the hands of Faye goes on forever.  The riot scene that ends the movie becomes a Night of the Living Dead ripoff and the whole thing just drags on. Furthermore, the key sequence of the book (Tod imitating the police sirens) gets lost and Tod just cries and gnashes his teeth or something.  This is a terrible movie. The original book deserves much better 
 The information is inaccurate according to historical records.  I would suggest reading "A Ghost Hunter's Guidebook" (Third Edition) by Troy Taylor and "So There I Was... More Confessions of Ghost Hunters" by Troy Taylor and Len Adams for more information on The Myrtles.  You can also do a search on the internet for the article "The Legends, Lore and Lies of The Myrtles Plantation".  Or, if you're ever in St. Francisville, you can go to the courthouse and the historical society and check through the records yourself.  For instance, Winter was indeed murdered on the front porch by an unknown assailant but after being shot, he immediately fell down and died.  His bloody trip through the house never took place -- information that was easily found in historical records.  There is also no evidence to say that Judge Woodruff ever carried on affairs with his slaves.  Although the house is genuinely haunted, which can be attested to by generations of owners, guests, and ghost hunters, it is not haunted for any of the reasons that have been claimed in the publicity surrounding the house.  As has been said more than once - "when the legend is better than the truth, print the legend".  This is an adage that has been closely followed by the Myrtles, misleading hundreds of ghost hunters and enthusiasts over the years.  I do not discount paranormal activity at The Myrtles - just the legends that surround them.  Although, some of the events in this book are not quite true to the nature of ghosts (read Troy Taylor's "A Ghost Hunter's Guidebook" (Third Edition) for more information on that).  I am compelled to say that the story about black kids having classes with black teachers and white kids having classes with white teachers and that there was a black lunch and a white lunch in school (when Ms. Kermeen bought The Myrtles) is not true.  I was in high school in Louisiana at the time Kermeen bought The Myrtles.  Black and white kids went to the same classes, were taught by both black and white teachers, and they all ate lunch together - and had been doing so since before I started school.  In 1980, the federal government would not have allowed this separation to occur no matter what the local residents' feelings were on the subject.  My mother was a teacher in Louisiana at the time of integration.  By federal mandate, black students and teachers and white students and teachers had to be combined - and it had to be as equal as possible.  This was not a choice and this happened way before 1980.  I am currently a teacher in the Louisiana public school system so I do know a bit about its history and the federal regulations governing the public school system.  This separation would absolutely never have occurred.  This story was too much like The Amityville Horror...more of a "Hollywood" type ghost story than a "true" ghost story.  It's a waste of money and it insults your intelligence.  This quote is from a booklet about The Myrtles: "James and Frances Kermeen Meyers passed through St. Francisville in the 1980s on a riverboat cruise and while visiting purchased the Myrtles. The Meyers ownership coincided neatly with the then-current fad of "Murder Mystery Weekends" in which local historians and surviving family members say that history was rewritten in a manner they consider "disgraceful"."  If you're interested in true ghost stories, read books by Troy Taylor.  He's written quite a few 
 I was very disappointed with this film.  I had hoped to learn about the "Birth of a Nation" and "prenatal" life in the region.  But the entire film is about postnatal fighting.  The film is appropriate for people who find fighting to be glorious - for people who like to keep score of battles and casualties like some kind of sports game.  This ugly film depicted the entire society as being barbaric.  In fact it sanctified the barbarism as being something heroic.  Surely the beautiful people and the rich culture of this region deserve more than this.  Surely the viewers deserve more than this History Channel pandering.  
 I must add a comment to the reviewer above. You cannot argue with cliches. A cliche is a cliche, and if you can't see those phrases are cliches, then you haven't read enough. But then again, if you like dull, cliched writing, have a blast.   I bought this book based on these feeble minded reviews. This novel is filled with cliches and HORRIBLY edited! This is the writing of a novice writer, something you'd expect from a subsidy press. Don't believe me? On page 12, there are over 25 cliches in a single paragraph, and it doesn't stop there. It keeps going and going for 397 horrible overwritten sloppy prose. Here are some of the cliches, about Filius's father pulling him out of the water:  "A violent thunderstorm tore up the sky. Dark clouds, heavy and slow, despite the screaming wind... like a bouquet of black roses." (um, like is there anything original here? Just count the number of cliches- I shall continue, but 7 cliches here)  "A roll of thunder ended with a bang he felt deep in his chest."- 3 cliches in a row! Wow! "The lake churned below..." "He looked up into the black gloom..." "The welts of brightness that shattered the sky..." "lulled by the rhythmic pouinding that beat in his ears...  washing over the pier." this time it's 4 for 4! "For a moment he was swimming in air- weightless..." 2 for 2!  And it goes on and on, and this isn't even all the cliches in this one paragraph even! C'mon people! Anyone who can't see this is abysmal writing doesn't know what they are talking about. Any halfway decent editor should have caught this, but it just goes to show how bad editors are. For a novel being praised as one that 'constructs vivid lives as well as the heart and breadth of the country' is certainly not going to get it here, in this novel. This prose is flat and dull, and no editor should have deluded poor Bruce into thinking he has any writing talent. A novel like this just confirms the horror that passes for fiction today. The dialoge, too, consists of a bunch of card-board cut outs and stereotypes and overwritten, dull descriptive cliches that serve no purpose. (Such as this rote description of this woman in a bathtub looking at her pubic hair, that is neiter 1) described well, nor 2) has anything of insight to offer. What is the point? Merkoff has nothing to say, for not even he knows. Again, where are the editors? But let me end with the brilliance of (from page 115):   "...rain became mixed with blood...scarlet drops turning pink with skydriven water. Rain and blood. And the storm was upon them."  Cue the 2001 Space Odyssey music. Foreboding is it? I think not. What laziness. Go make some popcorn. 
 Muse is obviously one of the top bands musically in this day and age.  Creative music and lyrics will always make them an amazing listening experience.    1st note:  There is abolutely no Muse music on this DVD.  I guess they did not, or could not get copywrite approval for the DVD.  Maybe this should have been considered before even creating this DVD.  2nd note:  The DVD does contain Muse interviews and such, but compared to the 63 minutes on the total DVD, its probably less than 15 minutes.  Some of the interview footage is rather funny.  3rd note:  The DVD does give some interesting history on how Muse met, where they came from, etc...    4th note:  The DVD does have some interviews with people who have worked with them.  The best of the interviews come from the old Guitar Tech, and a Producer.  All the other interview sessions sound like a sale or a promotion of the band.  Not sure how or where this DVD really came from, but it kind of was a dissapointment.  Quality is pretty high, so some one did definately put some $$ behind this project.  But seriously, how can you have a MUSE dvd without MUSE music?    
 As much as I try not to generalize from limited data, I must make the following observation: sportswriters should stick to writing books about things they know, i.e., sports. Sportswriters should NOT try to write about technical subjects like spaceflight. The prime example of a book that should never have been written is "For All Mankind," by sportswriter Harry Hurt--the hands-down, all-time, worst-written, least accurate, most-full-of-breathtaking-technical errors spaceflight book ever. "Too Far From Home," by Chris Jones (also a sportswriter), is not nearly as bad, but it is still clear that the author doesn't understand some of the things he wrote about.  By the time I was 50 pages into "Too Far From Home," I was reeling from Mr. Jones' jarring, bizarre and oversimplified descriptions of spaceflight technology. Here are a few examples. He portrays NASA's early spacecraft as "corrugated-tin capsules held together by hardware-store screws." What an injustice to the nationwide team of dedicated engineers and technicians who built what were, at the time, state-of-the-art vehicles. How about this one: during the final few seconds before a shuttle launch, "the three main engines began gimbeling [sic], testing their directional thrust...throwing off a little push with each pull of the trigger..." Huh? What trigger? Who's pulling a trigger? It's a pre-programmed computer-controlled sequence. Here's another one. Just as the shuttle enters orbit: "...a loud clang signaled that the external fuel tank had been blown loose and begun to come apart..." Jones seems to think that the ET blows up as soon as it separates from the Orbiter. It doesn't--it stays intact until it re-enters atmosphere and burns up (mostly) half a world away from its release point.  Jones also apparently doesn't know much about airplanes. He describes air-to-air combat exercises in which missiles "punch holes through" the wings of drone aircraft, "maybe spilling a few gallons of hydraulic fluid." A hole in a wing is much more likely to release fuel, not hydraulic fluid, since that's where an airplane's fuel tanks usually are. Describing test pilot Ken Bowersox's "twin-engine beater" personal airplane, Jones says that the intrepid soon-to-be-astronaut "push[ed] his flying heap higher still, sometimes high enough to catch a glimpse of the curvature of the earth." There's no airplane except for the likes of the SR-71 that can fly high enough for its pilot to see the curvature of the earth. NO private plane can do so.   I was also taken aback by Jones' interminable use of off-the-wall similes to express concepts in ways that many readers might relate to, but that greatly sacrifice accuracy in the process. For example, I sincerely doubt that shuttle crewmembers seated in the mid-deck during launch think of themselves as "...hiding out like stowaways, like kids sneaking into a drive-in by getting locked in the trunk of a car." Locker-room and sports metaphors abound, which I found tiresome after a while, as I did his insistence on assigning motivations that he could not possibly know to virtually every person he writes about.  There is, of course, more to "Too Far From Home" than spaceflight hardware, and some readers will probably enjoy the human-interest stories. But in a field such as spaceflight, in which technology reigns supreme, an author should at least get the technology right. Jones often does not. I have to wonder why, and for whom, he wrote it. Space geeks will find it maddeningly simplified and sorely lacking in technical understanding, and need not bother reading it. I had to force myself to finish it. Casual readers may like its fast-paced, easygoing style, and may gain a little understanding of some aspects of spaceflight--but that understanding will likely echo the author's flawed knowledge. My recommendation to all readers is to give "Too Far From Home" a pass. There are many far superior spaceflight books available. I give it two stars just because it IS marginally better than "For All Mankind," which I rated with one star only because Amazon doesn't allow zero-star ratings 
 I am sorry, but I have to add a discordant note to all the glowing five star ratings everyone is giving this album.  When you're ready to sit down with a glass of wine and some cheese to listen to some pleasant jazz, you flop in Bill Frisell's  Unspeakable and get a bunch of inharmonious ca ca.  Especially on tracks 13 and 14.  There's tons of better stuff out there.  Go buy something else 
 I'm a huge Funkadelic fan, and I'm still getting into Praxis. This CD is 100% techno, so if you are into that kind of stuff, go ahead and buy it. I don't mind random electronic music (I'm also a big King Crimson fan), but the music on this CD is not the best quality, and it's really repetitive 
 THE EVIL THAT MEN DO Nancy Holder (2000)  RATING:  2/5 Stakes  SETTING:  Season Three  CAST APPEARANCES:  Buffy, Joyce, Willow, Oz, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia, Willy the Snitch, Devon, Sheila Rosenberg, Ira Rosenberg  MAJOR ORIGINAL CHARACTERS:  Helen, Julian (ancient Roman vampires); Jordan Smythe (flunky); Mark Dellasandra (high schooler); Nick Daniels (Bronze manager); Claire Bellamy (Bronze); Diana (ancient Roman Slayer)  BACK-OF-THE-BOOK SUMMARY:  "After a vicious shooting spree, the town of Sunnydale is shell-shocked.  What could have sparked the random rampage?  Buffy Summers can guess.  Considering the prophetic dreams she's been having, the Slayer suspects possession by an especially malevolent force.  As the police follow their typical false leads, the Slayerettes start up their own research into possible paranormal causes.  But when Oz's van is discovered on the side of the road, minus one teen wolf, a distraught Willow turns on Buffy, disrupting the investigation.  With the pressure in Sunnydale mounting, the residents' reactions to stress grow increasingly unpredictable.  The Slayer continues her search for answers, narrowly surviving an attack by a well-trained and powerful vampire who brought a gruesome death to every Slayer who crossed her path.  Is this the ancient creature behind the recent influx of evil?  Or is there another influence . . . close to home?"  REVIEW  	Set-Up:  What do you get when you mix Nancy Holder, two ancient Roman vampires, and a plot to raise an ancient deity to destroy the world?  Punchline:  An incredibly boring Buffy novel titled The Evil That Men Do.  I perhaps shouldn't be quite so harsh, as there is one or two good ideas in the novel, it's just that on the whole the book lacks energy, humor, surprises, creativity, and all of those other things one looks for in a good novel. 	Helen and Julian, two vampires from the age of Caligula, have waited several centuries for a chance to call forth the goddess Meter and rule the world.  When they hatch their vile scheme in Sunnydale, the water supply gets laced with an "everyone turn evil" drug, turning citizen against citizen as "all hell breaks loose."  Seriously . . .  it's just plain bad. 	Our Terrible Twosome of bad guys have standard villain personas:  Julian is the suave, cultured, smarmy James Bond movie villain, while Helen is the vicious, want-to-kill-everything-that-moves type of villain.  Their backstory is fairly interesting, even if it takes a while to get moving.  As for the Scoobies, they're all fulfilling their standard roles:  Cordelia gets kidnapped, Oz shapechanges, Buffy stakes.  The book just doesn't have much life to it, and should be avoided in favor of the many better ones out there.  [... 
 My girlfriend has this CD. I never even heard of these dudes. But somethimes when my girlfriend is driving she has this CD on in her car and just something about the way she drives and she's sunk way down in her seat with the rearview mirror slanted all the way down, and something about the way she mouths the words but doesn't actually sing out loud, and something about the way her hair is always too long in her face and the way her car always smells like pink roses. Its just really cool. Otherwise I would never in a million years listen to this stuff. 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.  If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 I believe the quality of this transfer (along with the one for Raise The Red Lantern) is so horrific that it completely ruines the beautiful experience of watching these Gong Li/ Zhang Yimou movies and should not even be offered for sale. Truly Ba 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 This book makes the most grievous error a book can make: it's boring.  The title sounded intriguing, but the book is a real snooze.  I skipped page after page looking for something of interest to read.  Alas, I found nothing.  Talk about disappointment.  I was hoping for a scathing analysis of the degradation of language in contemporary discourse and music.  What I got was...well, I'm not sure but it put me to sleep within 5 minutes.  I don't want to read in-depth analyses of speeches from 1856 or whatever.  Maybe there's another book out there that discusses the devaluation of language in pop culture in a compelling way.  This one ain't...I mean, isn't, it 
     No this book did not leave off unfinished, well it may have, I'll never know since I cannot bring myself to pick it up again and I'm only about halfway through it. One reviewer said if you could stick it out through the first 150 pages you'd be glad, but I felt that reaching that point did not signify any speeding up of the story after it's sloooow start.  The only reason I stuck it out as long as I did was due to a lack of anything else to read at the time, but since I have replenished my reading materials, I feel no need to continue further.  This book is miserable and stays that way.  I can't imagine even wanting to see a happy ending for it, as the characters being so miserable themselves make them very unlikeable for me. I like escaping into the lives of ordinary people, but not to become miserable, I need no book to do that.  If you're looking for something along those lines try Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, but avoid this book if, well, just avoid it really.  
 I ditto the previous reviewer...i thought these seats were adjustable, was I wrong, there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down..  suck 
 I was very disappointed in this product.   It is for a child and yet the wood string holder was not even attached to the guitar.  This product lasted a whole two days before the part fell off and you could no longer use the guitar.   The tuners also were unable to tighten so you basically had a piece of useless wood shaped like a guitar. 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 Based on the other reviews, I was eager to read this book. What a disappointment! The decorating advice is the same as every other book: declutter, have comfortable chairs with reading lights, hang some art, put kitchen things where you use them, design your home for you, not based on decorating magazines. What differentiates this book is that the standard material is wrapped in New Age 'spiritual' veils and tassles, so a room now has an "altar" instead of a "focal point." This lingo might have some value in knocking people into thinking about what they truly want in a home, but if you already have a comfortable home, you won't learn anything new here 
 Saw this movie once&don't want to see it again.  Jim Carrey,before getting more mature roles in "Man in the Moon","Eternal Sunshine"&"Truman Show",indulges in endless slapstick,gets plenty of gross-out humor,beds Courtney Cox (before "Friends",David Arquette&baby Coco)&finds out oh!the horror!the horror!he's kissed a man.Since this was before "Brokeback"&Heath&Jake won their Best Kiss from the MTV movie awards,Jim goes through an elaborate "purification" ceremony.  It relies on gags;this isn't a great movie.It ranks with "Wild Wild West" as one of the worst.Do yourself a favor&avoid this movie 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 This author has nothing to do with real Taoism, but spins things in Taoism his way, calling himself an achieved "Master". A total fruad aimed at the naive and gullible 
 Alot of the same info.Which has already been written before in previous American books 
 John Rechy wrote a book that had a pronounced place in my adolescent life, "City of Night," in which he dealt frankly with homosexual male sexuality in the context of cruising and street sex, and I remember it as a vividly erotic piece of work.  It was with high hopes that I approached "The Coming of the Night," in which he follows a number of characters through one day in Los Angeles puncuated by the fearsome Santa Ana winds, which charge and pump up all the players' sexual drives.  First problem:  too many characters developed too thinly.  Second problem:  for a book that deals almost exclusively with sex, it's not very hot.  Third problem:  Rechy attempts to portray the gay world at the moment AIDS explodes unbeknownst to his motley cast of men and, in order to do so, he resorts to the kind of lurid and weary detailing of s&m, gang bangs and porno shoots that was handled much more credibly in the pulp fiction of the 50s and 60s.  It's wonderful that Rechy is still writing and publishing; I would like to see him break some new ground next time around.  Dealing with life post-AIDS would be a fascinating area to see him work with. Only for the fans 
 This CD Is garbage. Juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album. He was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one. If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you "this is a good comeback album" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow 
 This book was good for beginners, folks just starting a workout plan. Buy the book for the recipes... this book gives very good options for tasty low fat / sugar foods. 
 This movie is not so much a sequel to the original, but simply a film that borrows that film's premise and tries to rejuvenate it with different touches.  Ultimately, it doesn't work because the script and pacing are weak, and although Eric Lively and Erica Durance are charming in their roles, their thespian skills don't really convince us they're sincere in their performances.  There is also no real explanation for Lively's abilities and when he makes his final "return", why doesn't he just not go to work and then maybe...well, don't want to spoil it.  It's not a rotten movie, but it's merely another direct to video release that won't stay with you too long 
 Restall's conclusions add nothing to what Tzvetan Todorov has already said in The Conquest of America-which Seven Myths gets wrong in its dismissal of Todorov's crucial point about the role of writing in the Conquest.  Merely being able to put information down on paper isn't the issue.  What Todorov means is much more complex, and is grounded in evidence from anthropology to neuroscience (e.g., Ong, Goody, Havelock, Panksepp).  First, with written words fixed in front of you, you can re-read, check for inconsistencies, compare to other accounts to assess accuracy and consider alternatives, even elaborate.  You, in fact, practice thinking skills you have little opportunity to develop unless literate.  Restall also sees no reason to prefer an alphabetic system over, say, Aztec pictographs that interpreters used to recall memorized speeches embodying the culture.  But only with an alphabet can you unambiguously set down every single thing a person can think; and only then can an idea be fully worked out and fully critiqued.  Evidence shows that the way you think when you internalize an alphabetic written language is significantly more abstract, analytical, and adaptable than when you rely primarily on speech.  Second, as Restall claims, "disease," "native disunity," "Spanish steel," and "the culture of war," are causes of the Aztec defeat, but, as Todorov rightly argues, they are only the immediate causes.  Underlying them is the ability to productively command signs (whether words or behaviors)-an ability that hinges on writing.  It's because the Spaniards had an extensive body of written knowledge that they had steel.  It's because of Cortés' writing-based innovative thinking that he could exploit information about the "native" situation to win allies.  It's because of the Aztecs' speech-based tradition-dominated thinking that they didn't see the Spaniards as a dangerous new breed of enemy that needed to be dispatched-long before smallpox arrived with a later expedition-and didn't effectively adapt battle conventions to fight this new, unpredictable enemy.  Aztec society, as Todorov emphasizes, was NOT inferior to Spanish society in any absolute way.  The Aztecs clearly had a complex and highly successful culture.  But, at that moment in history, faced with a new kind of enemy shaped by written language, they did not successfully compete.  Restall uncritically dismisses Todorov's argument instead of getting it straight 
 Over the years I've learned to beware of writers who earn their living inside the walls of academe. It's often a creative trap, and Ms. Moore is no exception. She shows all the shortcomings of a scribe who uses her students as bouncing boards for vignettes, none of which deal with people very far from university life and none of which are in any real sense true short stories. The "in" jokes among her often stereotypical characters may amuse freshmen writing majors, but the average reader looks in vain for any true authenticity (as, for example in the stories of Alice Munro or T.C. Boyle). The shame of it is that Ms. Moore can write--but in this collection she chooses to offer us nothing that holds any attention beyond a clever sentence 
 If I had seen this in a bookstore, I would have passed it up.  The book is flimsy and the bear is very small.  The diaper  pants for the bear are very tiny and difficult to put on, so my little boy doesn't really get any benefit from them.  I don't care for the format of having parent notes on  the same page as the story.  In all, very disappointing 
 We bought this a week ago, it did not have an owners manual, so we did not know what to do differently when the gauge said after 2 days that the filter needed replaced. Our water tank got broke today and I have been online for a long time trying to find a replacement tank for it, with NO luck. 
 This review is for the MP3 audio cd.  Unless I received a faulty cd, this audio book was generated by an automated translation program. It's fraud. You don't pay to listen to a computer voice. I can't comment on the book 'Acres of Diamonds', which I was anxious to read/listen to, as this cd was so pathetic. [...]  
 Unless you're into spamming folks, who filter out junk mail anyway, you won't find much value in this book. Each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email (spam) campaign in order to get recognition (and thus advertise to the reader). 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 It's a classic I know, but I just couldn't follow the country dialouge. Seeing the movie, the story itself is good. But in the book it is soo hard to understand and doesn't.....flow. Maybe it is just me? It's a classic, but I didn't like it. I recomend the book 
 I was pleased with the way the Hoover cleaned my floors, except that I had to empty the containers too many times.  After using it for 3 or 4 weeks, I realized that it is scratching and scuffing the floors and they look terrible.  I hope I can return it because I can no longer use it.  Terry Sit 
 My 6 yr old son got this as a Christmas present.  It is disgusting!!  The stuff is sticky and oozes out when it is setting.  It isn't very tasty either.  My son liked the gummies but there was some kind of drink that we poured down the drain. I have put it up and am hoping that he forgets that we have it!!  The recipes are not hard to follow but pouring them into the molds and getting everything set up requires an adult. 
 I am a huge fan of Linda Howard's books. I have purchased each and every one of them. I live in Israel so getting her books in English from the U.S.A. isn't cheap Cover of Night was the most disappointing book of Linda Howard's I have ever read. It was boring and I foung myself turning the pages and looking for something interesting to read in that particular book. I hope the next one is more interesting. I will keep looking forward to her books since I have enjoyed and re-read many of the ones I have 
 The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing else The explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous The art work of the robots was good Will Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon. I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters.  The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity.  None of this appeared in the movie 
 I've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips, activities, posters, etc.  However, I have also gotten endless emails from Mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  For the last three or four weeks, they've been calling me on the telephone every day.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  The few good ideas in each $6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment 
 This product would be great - if it worked.  I bought this product and it worked great... as advertised... I loved it. Audio, video, IR (remote) worked and were clear. One morning, about 45 days after I bought it, it just stopped working. Assuming the problem was environmental, I had the unit extensively tested by an A/V pro. It was clearly the unit. So I contacted the manufacturer and sent it back. I had high hopes that I just got a lemon, and the next unit would be fine.  The second unit failed within two days (different type of failures). Again I had it checked out, and had the setup and placement checked thoroughly - I mean, what are the odds that two units would fail? Once again, defective equipment, and once again I sent it back.  Third unit lasted a couple of weeks - then failed.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have extensive A/V experience and love the idea of this product. Don't buy a product that will fail in a couple of days or months. Find another solution 
 Mann's gorgeous, rich prose cannot save this dull, plodding tale from being an ordeal to read.  The same density of language which charms the reader in the beginning becomes an irritant as hundreds of pages pass and almost literally nothing happens.  Characters are well drawn, but in gloomy colors which evoke no sympathy.  Not a single character stands as a hero; few are even likable.  The narrator is a long-winded bore.  In many respects, Adrian, the subject of this fictitious biography, remains inscrutable to the very end.  Having loved THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN, I persevered to the end in the hope of finding something to make the time invested seem worthwhile.  I was disappointed 
 There's nothing unique about this text - all the topics & discussions have been well covered in other basic textbooks on Corporate Finance, Mergers etc....   The discussions lack depth. The whole concept of Corporate Strategy has been miscontrued by the authors.... The link between this and Financial Markets is very ambiguous & blur!  FYI I'm a businessman & hold an MBA in Finance from an international university 
 This book was not helpful.  It gave you ideas on how to save that were common sense.  For example, cut down the guest list.  Dah!!! That is obvious, the less people the less expensive.   
 I must admit that I finished only 2/3 of this book, I just could not bear anymore, even as entertainment.  It was that bad.  But, from what I read, I advise that the plot is pointless and unrealistically laid down.  The characters, especially the main character and her love interest, are very poorly developed.  What is developed of the main character is unlikeable.  The book has the tone of someone who is talking (i.e. writing), not because she has something to say (she doesn't), but because she likes the sound of her own voice.  Wolitzer does know how to string words together well, but there is nothing upon which to hang those words, which is insulting to the reader. I knew before I read the book jacket that Wolitzer much teach creative writing.  It is obvious from the content of the book that she considers herself a literary giant and thinks that impressive. She should stick with that, her "novel" is beyond disappointing.  I'm sorry but the comparison to Wolitzer to Anne Tyler is laughable. 
 I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said "So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it." I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it! Divorce is against God's law, and I feel extremely strong about this. I cannot believe the message Ann M. Martin is sending to readers!  
 let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks 
 This is a very odd movie, which Leonard Maltin amusingly calls financial science fiction. Director Alan J Pakula is in one of his paranoid conspiracy theory moods a la Parallax View and All the Presidents Men, and as Jane Fonda's IPC company produced it, she thinks she's doing The China Syndrome. Apparently international currency is dependent on the Saudi Arabians whose ownership of oil makes them the richest people in the world. When they contemplate investing in gold rather than lending their wealth to support the banks, wall street fears a new world depression. This all sounds very scary until one wonders if the Arabs bankrupt everyone, what good will the gold be? One also wonders how seriously we are to take this when Pakula casts Kris Krisofferson, sans beard, as a banking troubleshooter! Casting Fonda as a former movie star who gave up her career to marry money is kind of prophetic consider her future marriage to Ted Turner. We aren't given a clue as to what kind of actress her character was, but the way Fonda is styled and lit suggests Joan Crawford, so then we can free associate Crawford with Pepsi and Al Steele. Whatever suspense Pakula is trying for is ruined by an awful music score by Michael Small, and the romance between Kristofferson and Fonda doesn't work either. Kristofferson is laughable as a he-man, and there is something icky in the idea that this is the kind of behaviour that Fonda responds to. There is also the unfortunate coincidence of their matching hairstyles - it recalls Lily Tomlin and John Travolta in Moment by Moment. One curiosity is the kind of computer software used at the time 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 I recently saw Les Miserables - 10th Anniversary Concert on DVD and absolutely fell in love with it so I thought I would try something similar and decided to give Candide try.  Boy, was I disappointed.  I can't get past the first 30 minutes -- all these silly gimmicky "jokes" that are not even remotely funny.  The singing is not bad (this cast has better technical control of their voices compared to the cast in Les Miz) but the choreography is trite and unimaginative, and the acting so juvenille that you'd think the characters are retarded.  When the narrator fired his gun and a "bang" flag shot out from the gun instead -- that was over the top for me....  Yuck.  
 This book was very well-organized and is a much more convenient ready-reference than the six SHRM Learning System module books.  Unfortunately, this book and CD set were very poorly edited.  The text and included CD contain numerous typos and erroneous answers (obviously from sloppy copying and pasting), which impeded learning and studying many of the concepts necessary to pass the PHR exam.  Also, the exam alerts were not at all representative of actual PHR exam material (based on my exam experience as of 15JUN06).  Though I did pass the PHR, this book was more of a hindrance than a help.    This book and CD set should have been an excellent resource, but the weaknesses created by the lack of attention to detail in editing greatly outweigh its strengths, rendering it an overall disappointment.  I would not recommend this book to anyone preparing for the PHR exam.  At best, it might serve as a supplement HR reference, as long as you can overlook the numerous errors 
 I tried many times to finish this book because once I buy it and start it, I hate to just walk away from it. BUT, this book did it. I was never really interested in the plot, I thought the writing was very basic, elementary actually, slow, and just plain boring. I tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up, but I never did get into to, making this the only book I've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing 
 I don't know if I got the same book than the other reviewers but our impressions about it are quite different. In my opinion drawings are not very clear and instructions get confusing with all this counterclock, reverse 90?, etc.  It is not that drawings are a bad thing, I have seen other books with illustrations that are actually easier to follow than photos but that is not the case of this book. Could be used in order to remind movements that you already know but forget about learning a new form from this book 
 I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.   
 While I appreciate the author's attempt to write an entertaining Christian novel, and while the theme of the novel is very relevant, it was apparent to me fairly early on what direction the story line was going.  I kept waiting for it to take a truly unexpected turn, and it never did.  Also, I think a better job could have been done of portraying the inner struggles of the main character 
 Why did they make Raistlin look like a total pansy. Of all the dragonlace writers...... Tracy Hickman is not all the grea 
 i got this for my cat (ocicat breed).  he's a short-haired cat that doesn't generally need much grooming except when the season changes.  shedender worked just like the commericals.  one brush and fur goes flying everywhere.  it does remove hair however the teeth of the comb are not deep so the removed hair goes either flying or stays on top of the fur towards the back.  as u can see in the picture the tool is small.  if you have the patience and extra time (and if your pet has the patience too!) u can think about saving some money with this tool.  if you want something more efficient, invest some extra money and go for the furminator instead.  i bought both and compared them but i'm keeping my furminator despite the much higher price 
 It had some moments, but overall, if i had it to do over again, i wouldn' 
 They couldn't let children sing about the "pelvic thrust" and had to change lyrics, so what's the point of doing the Time Warp again! ;D And that AWFUL cover of Ghostbusters makes me hurl! : 
 I have read both Losing the Race and Authentically Black (the former is the better of the two).  I felt Authentically Black just reinforced the points that McWhorter made in LTR and that perhaps the book was an effort to capitalize off of the success of LTR. I certainly agree with many of McWhorter's pts.  There is an overemphasis on victimazation in Black America.  We often don't value the achievements we have accomplished and we often don't know about those achievements at all.  There are things that we can do for ourselves such as valuing education and intellectual curiosity.  However, what Mr. McWhorter fails to acknowledge is that there is still institutional racism in America and that whites have an obligation to to put an end to to it since they are the ones that benefit from it.  The success of black people and all people of color is a two way street although McWhorter seems to think that it is a one way street.  I would recommend the book to get an idea of conservative black ideology but I think this book picks too much at black people's problems and not enough at possible solutions 
 The item was broken when I received it. Also, It is not what the picture looked liked. Very poorly made 
 Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner's book on the art of changing minds and affecting opinions has an appealing pull. Written by a qualified professional in the field, the book is another output of the impressive Harvard Business School Press. The book advances the view that there are seven, what it calls, "layers" or "levers" that affect a change of opinion. These factors, whose titles all begin with `re' are: -Reason -Research -Resonance -Resistances -Real World Events -Resources And Rewards and -Representational Redescriptions   Gardner subsequently proceeds to elaborate on each of the factors within contexts such as an institution, among a population, up close or as relate's to one's own mind.   So far, so good, many would say; alas the reader is compelled to add `so what?' to the phrase. Changing Minds is indeed the work of a qualified professional, but the reader is neither provided evidence nor shown the techniques and history behind the author's conclusions. Furthermore, being the work of a researcher in an academic setting, readers should not expect practical instructions or employable techniques. Rather, Changing Minds concentrates on the mechanics and psychological hypothesis. In this manner, the book is very much a scholastic paper. Finally, there is scant evidence that the author employs his own teachings. Little proof, research or reason is offered here to be convincing or allay any of the readers' resistances. Similarly dismissed is the need for charts, sub-titles, illustrations, indented or highlighted points or synopses.   Furthermore, and more ominously, the author makes several practical mistakes in the way he reads or interprets the world rendering some of his data and experiences suspect. He claims that schools are agents of change and serve to instill different opinions in youngsters. Those are his opinions and not supported by any empirical data. He does not provide any supporting data either. In fact, the contrary is true. Schools are designed to breed uniformity and teach adherence, obedience and group activity. Barely a student will pass physics class were he to challenge a prevalent theory. A law student will probably find himself choosing a new major should he differ with prescribed laws. Similarly, imagine a student disagreeing with the outcome of World War II, an astrology student disputing the form of nova stars or, at an elementary level, a high school student butting heads with his classmates and instructors. Another error is the assumption that events have lead to fundamental change even in thought process of political leaders. Let me quote from the book. While Gardner cites the example of George W Bush following September 11, 2001, many scholars and historians have shown that far from changing his mind, the US president instead leveraged the event to more resolutely drive his pre-existing agenda. Much of what transpired following the events of the day were the accelerations of the American president and his officials' overt and covert ideas and strategies. Gardner terms the new Bush, a "multilateralist"! Uncomfortably, 132 sovereign countries and a lack of support from the United Nations would disagree. Moreover, despite such fierce opposition, Bush proceeded with his plans nonetheless. Further down the pages, the author condemns Stalin's pact with Hitler as "cronyism." He conveniently forgets or omits the allies' earlier pact with Hitler or the West's subsequent treaty with the "extremely paranoid" Stalin. In short, being a tenured academic Gardner himself seems most susceptible to institutional tunnel vision and in need of constructive cognitive dissonance.   Lacking the appeal of practicality, the burden of proof or applicable relevance set in actual events Changing Minds: The Art And Science Of Changing Our Own And Other People's Minds is solely of interest to researchers in need of alternate sources on the topic.  Gardner does not provide any empirical basis for his opinions, which also deviate from the title and stated scope of the book 
 Anti-corporate Cassandras grind axes to sparse audiences these days.  In O'Boyle's piddling attempt to make us outraged at GE, he destroys his own credibility.  By attempting to pin every social ill of the late 20th  century on Jack Welch-- a good, if ruthless CEO-- his ideological ship  spins wildly out of control.  Downsizing is his fault. (Hello,  organizations are becoming streamlined all over the developed world)  Media  sensationalism is his fault. (Welch personally delights in the bottom  dwelling content of Dateline NBC) Anybody who has ever worked for a  corporation, especially one as big as GE, knows a few things that should  make readers way of O'Boyle's hokey cause and effect analysis: 1. The CEO  does not micromanage his or her company-- thousands of important decisions  are made under a CEOs jurisdiction every day. 2. Corporations are not  social utopias, and shouldn't be.  People get fired sometimes.  But people  are also given opportunities to do interesting work.  And competition is  good. 3. If there is a ubitiquitous problem in society, e.g. families are  no longer as stable, a corporation, which is sample unit of social  organization, will usually reflect, or possibly be linked more directly to  that problem.  However, small minds confuse this with causality, not  understanding the methodological pitfall of ad hoc ergo propter hoc.  For  example- families break up more, partially because people don't balance  work and family very well. Lots of people work for corporations.   Corporations caused the decline of the American family. Read the book--  O'Boyle is guilty of not understanding these truths and more 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 Basically this book sucks.  Iraq is not Babylon and Babylon is not Iraq.  Bush and the US had every right and justification to rid the world of Saddam and his regime.  On simple humanitarian justifications alone, Ali's argument crumbles.  Ali is an illiterate whose screed is a shameful pile of lies and distortions 
 The book should have been titled a less grandiose, "Determinate factors in success and failure over a wide range of economic studies."  Okay, I wouldn't have bought the book then, but if I did, I wouldn't have felt cheated.  Did he write these essays first, put the title on last, write the book with title in mind and simply get bored with the subject?  Who knows.  Although well-written, the book lacks focus and passion.  
 Don't get me wrong, I love the dobro and JD is one of if not the best, but as far as this album is concerned my wife put it best. "That music is really annoying.&quot 
 This book has a few pieces of useful information ... but overall there are many much better books out there about generations and how they differ (e.g., Generation Me, When Generations Collide, Generations). The authors take a spattering of information from other sources (they are not researchers or policy makers themselves), tell a few narratives, and that's about it. You are much better off buying another book on generations.   Also, notice the publisher: Focus on the Family. Thus the book is written from an explictly stated Christian perspective. For some readers this might be a bonus; others might be put off by this in a book that is not about religion 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book.  While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest 
 It seems to me that this book was written for jazz walking bass only. It is also not very helpful because there are hardly any exercises to practice the theory being presented. It is easy to say things like: "Use passing tones between chord tones", or :"Try to stay away from always playing the root on beat one". A short 2 bar example following is not of much help either. The other problem I had with this course was the author attempting to make the student "see all the chord tones of each chord throughout the entire fingerboard". Again this may be possible with correct exercises, otherwise only experts with many years of playing exprience would be capable of that.  I was learning from "Walking Bass Lines" by Ed Friedland at the time and I must admit that this is a much better manual and explains the same material followed by simple and developmental exercises. You will get so much more out of this book than FBH.  All in all this manual is for pros that most likely already know all the material. (refresher course maybe?) But if you are learning bass you won't get very far before you dump this into your closet.   
 Appreciate the stories told by this author about his life and consider the insights that he has gained from reflection on his experience; but, please, do not base your understanding of Quakerism on his presentation.  In spite of the fact that Smith is a lifelong Friend and a former Quaker educator, he quotes George Fox (an important leader in the early Quaker movement) and the Bible inaccurately or out of context several times.  In addition, some of Smith's statements about facets of Quaker faith and practice are historically unfounded or ignore the diversity within the Religious Society of Friends today. If you are interested in learning about Quakerism, read Wilmer A. Cooper's book, A Living Faith: An Historical Study of Quaker Beliefs (Friends United Press: 1990).  Read Robert Lawrence Smith's book as a book of wisdom written by a Quaker, but not necessarily a Quaker book of wisdom 
 does anyone know the song thats played when Brian is chasing the guys on the dirtbikes near the end of the film? i would really apresiate it. = 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 Do NOT order this book as an E-Book! You can only print out 19 pages every 7 days. As a diet book, if you can't have it handy and accessible it doesn't do you much good. I have had to order the paperback (which I'm excited about), but have not had good luck trying to get a refund and return the e-book 
 I was dissapointed when I listened to this cd.  All I wanted was the original version of the Perfect Drug.  This cd only has the remixes.  So if you're buying this cd for the original version, you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the Lost Highway instead 
 This is the last and final time I will be reviewing this movie.  The movie begins as Izzy Daniels, a boxer, is dancing in the streets. (Can we some Lionel Richie in the background?) He comes across Mary and her friends double-dutching where he says that it looks pretty easy, and all that jazz.  He watches them at a competition, and realizes it looks like fun, so he joins there team, but Mary is hesitant to let him join. Finally, he joins.  But doesn't tell his father. Ah, yes, the plot thickens.  Overall, an "okay" movie, but not worth buying if you ask me. It's pretty much like every other Disney Channel movie out there. Person is good at one thing, then does something to disappoint someone else, big happy ending.  Personally, the music was just okay. But everybody wants to be a singer. I mean, Keke Palmer needs to STEP AWAY from the microphone.  Corbin does his best at producing an upbeat track, "Push It To The Limit", and ends up making a fairly-decent song, but not great.  Worth watching on Disney Channel when they play it, if you can spare an hour and a half. 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I don't want to challenge anyone's right to be a conscientious objector, but isn't it ironic that someone with this name, who starts a band called "The Raiders" and who habitually wears military uniforms, should have been one?  Also on the 'things are not quite what they seem' theme: on the insert notes and in the 'autobiographical' track titled The Legend of Paul Revere we are told that Paul was 'flipping burgers' when he decided to form a group.  Maybe so, but it's worth noting that he was actually the owner of a string of burger joints.  But what of the music?  Pure bubble gum; great if you like that kind of thing.  It's very derivative; you'll hear shades of The Byrds, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in there.  There is some excellent instrumental work, so they were not entirely without talent, and they turn out some great R&B sounds on occasion.  They simply discovered that wearing tights, growing Beatle hairstyles and singing pap was a great way to have fun and make fortunes.  There was clearly friction between founder members Revere and vocalist Mark Lindsay.  The latter (often seen as the real star of the group) wanted to develop the music further, whereas Revere was happy to keep blowing bubbles.  It's noteworthy that on their respective websites, they make little or no mention of each other.  Lindsay did go on to other things.  Revere, last I heard, was still prancing around in antique uniforms, singing the same songs.  To be fair, those that see his show say it's great fun.  
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
 For anyone interested in detecting lies in the marketplace, politics, and marriage: this is the last book you should buy.  Slight exaggeration aside, there are probably 3 semi-valuable pages in this book.    Ekman spends about 275 pages trying to convince you that even if you believe someone is lying, you might be wrong...or, actually, you may be right...The entire book is a dizzying succession of tautologies.  He is so scared that you will read his hypotheses (which are of no practical value - who can spot a "micro-expression" without buying his $50 software and training on it for a month?) and accuse an innocent person of lying (or vice versa) that he has rendered this book useless.  If you are a masochist and are interested in reading a book where an insecure researcher talks to himself for hundreds of pages, by all means buy this book.  There IS a reliable protocol for detecting lies, and there are at least a couple of books that I know of that go over it in detail, in less than 200 pages.    
 I understand the appeal of having the convenience of a spout on a bottle of oil, but be aware that the spout will allow air into the bottle. You may think air only gets in when you pour oil out, but that's not true. Any time the temperature rises, the air in the bottle expands and some escapes through the spout. When the temperature drops, air enters the spout. This is true of even small changes in temperature such as you experience in a kitchen. If you don't use the oil pretty quickly this constant exchange of air will expose the oil to oxygen and that will cause the oil to go rancid.  If you use cheap olive oil (and pretty much all grocery store olive oil is cheap oil -- even the extra virgin) you may not notice as much since cheap oils tend to be more bitter than good olive oils, but it will still happen. I would never put olive oil in a bottle with a spout again. (I learned this lesson the hard way.)  A better option, though less elegant, is to use a bottle with a pour spout and cap, or find a pour spout that has a cap to seal it 
 I could never understand why this album came out a year after Nothing Safe: The Best of the Box.  All the songs on this disc (except Heaven Beside You) are found on NSBOTB.  PLUS you get the AMAZING Get Born Again and 5 other songs not found on this CD.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Alice in Chains are possibly the greatest band of all time, don't get me wrong....I just don't think this measures up value-wise to the other possibilities 
 I am ashamed to say I read this entire book. I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. It is filled with typos and poor organization of thoughts and topics. Clarkson actually spells Mel Gibson's name wrong several times throughout the book, and refers to Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner as "Dormer" for several pages! He jumps back and forth from one movie production to another making it difficult to follow. Lastly, he relies on the accounts of people who had met Mel Gibson at one time but who had either a personal or professional conflict with him. In the retelling of these conflicts and what went down, we hear one point of view only - and generally that is the view of someone who is harboring bitterness and resentment towards Gibson, so their accounts are slanted and untrustworthy. The best part of the book is the end for two reasons: Clarkson finally gets to Gibson's most recent project, The Passion of the Christ. The subtitle and the picture on the back of the book gives the impression this project will be a major focus of the book, but after 300 pages of reading, I was still waiting for the subject to come up. I have to say I felt that this was the only well written part of the whole book - thoughtful and interesting. The second reason the end is the best part of the book is that it was finally over. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but I can't help it. I highly recommend reading the book about the making of the Passion of the Christ - you can learn a lot about Gibson there - but I cannot recommend this biography 
 I got this book as a gift and i think after reading it" only if it was that easy to forget about your pain!" I think the book tells us the strong link between the mind and pain but doesn't offer anything new when it comes to solving the problem of pain through exercises which 99% of todays experts say is the best solution to back or neck pain. Invest in an updated book that tells you how to exercise anywhere 
 I think this quote from a review sums this up the best - "As we all know, we have the power to rule ourselves. This being said, what are we waiting for?"  If this were in a book from the world, I would expect a statement like that, but from a professing Christian?  I had control of my life for years and it progressively drove me further and further away from God.  Having control of our own life is the PROBLEM, not the solution.  The solution lies in surrendering control of our lives to the God who created us, not continuing in rebellion against Him.  When I was the ruler of my own life, it led to me breaking every single one of his moral codes that He gave to mankind.  Just look at them (the ten commandments) -   1. I thought I was fine with this one - I didn't believe in Allah or Zeus or any other gods. Of course, I was still nowhere near keeping this one ("don't have any other Gods before me") - there were plenty of other things I put in my life before God. I'd rather sleep in than go to church. I'd rather watch tv than read the Bible, etc.   2. I thought I was fine with this one because I didn't make any silly carved gods or idols. But I still made a god in my image. Every time I would say "why would God..." or "my God wouldn't..." or "I don't think God would...." I was making up a god in my image. Coincidentally enough, it was always happy with the things I was doing, but He was going to get all those other "bad" people. (Also, if you agree with Dr. Schuller that the key to knowing God is self-love and a positive attitude, you're guiltly of breaking this one also)  3. OK, I knew I was guilty of taking the Lord's name in vain and using it as a profanity, which was bad enough, but I was even worse than that. I was calling myself a Christian, yet I lived with my wife for years before getting married, never attended church or even had any idea what the Bible said and basically just living a competely ungodly lifestyle. While using God as a profanity is violating this commandment, what I was doing was taking the Lord's name (i.e. calling myself a CHRISTian) in vain in an even worse sense.   4. I would also admit I was guilty of this one. No matter how you want to interpret the sabbath law, I wasn't putting aside any days for God, they were all for me.   5. Honor your father and mother? Not even close. 'Nuff said.   6. Don't murder? Good, I'm fine on that one - oh wait, Jesus said that whoever hates anyone is a murderer. Got me on that one too.   7. No adultery? I was fine on this one too, I never cheated on my wife. Of course, as I already mentioned, I lived with her for years before we got married. I didn't see this as wrong because I had no idea whatsoever of the seriousness of this in God's eyes. Under God's law the penalty for adultery or any sexual sin was the same as murder. In the New Testament, it is clear that even professing Christians who don't honor their marriage commitments are only fooling themselves. That's because marriage isn't about us. Sure it's a wonderful, beautiful thing for us, but more importantly it was designed as an earthly expression of God's love for His people. Corrupting that gives a distorted picture of who God is which is why it is so badly under attack today, even from professing Christians. Some people think that if you're a Christian, you have to stop liking sex. Not true at all, I love sex. The Bible has a whole book in it about sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7 saying "not tonight dear, I have a headache" is a sin (and just before the guys get too excited about that one, it says that our bodies don't belong to ourselves, but to our spouses, and while the concept is obviously sexual, I think that if your wife wants to use your body to take out the garbage or do the dishes, that qualifies too). But God designed it and it needs to be done his way (and of course I disagreed with this, which took me back to the second commandment). But even more so - I was really in trouble with this one because Jesus said that whoever looks at a woman with lust has already commited adultery. Well, I was in trouble there.   8. Don't steal anything? Well, I never stole anything big so I was fine. Doesn't matter, even when I stole toilet paper from the buildings on campus so that we wouldn't have to buy any for our apartment in college, that's still stealing.   9. Don't lie. See my comments on honor your father and mother (which is actually kind of ironic, since when I tried to proclaim my honesty, sometimes I'd say "well, I lie to my parents sometimes, but that's ok.")   10. Don't covet. See those same comments again. Don't want something that doesn't belong to you - if I told you that I've always kept this commandment, you'd probably die laughing and you don't even know me.   But God's a loving God?  (these quotations are all from the New Testament and written TO CHRISTIANS)  "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God." (1 Cor 6:9-10)  "For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not be partakers with them." (Eph 5:5-7)  "Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." (Gal 5:19-21)  The reason Dr. Schuller's television show and books are so popular is because people want to feel good about themselves while continuing in their sins and yet still feel that somehow they'll still get to go to heaven when they die.  But there's one problem with this - why did Jesus have to die?  Dr. Schuller's gospel has no answer for this question.  But the Bible does.  The Bible looks at the sins that you and I have committed (and after reading that list, if you can honestly say that you have not sinned.... well, I have no answer for that other than to pray for you) and say that we deserve hell.  Hell is a real place (not just low self-esteem or any kind of hell on earth that we can imagine) full of pain and torture.  It's what we deserve, but God loves us and doesn't want us to go there.  So He took all those sins that you and I have committed and paid the price for them Himself.  He took the penalty for our transgressions so that we don't have to.  That's the true Gospel, and you can accept that forgiveness.  All you need to do is stop believing in a self-love gospel and recognize sin for what it is - sin.  Then turn from those sins and put your full trust in Jesus.  Stop reading these books and start reading God's Word - the Holy Bible.  He will not let you down.  You will move from death to life, your final destination will change from hell to heaven.  Please at least take the time to look into what I'm saying.  Right now there's a million and one things I'd rather be doing (and some I should be doing) than typing a review for something I completely disagree with, but I'm doing this for the exact reason that I mentioned above - HELL IS REAL WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT!  God doesn't want you to go there (just look at all the agony He suffered so you wouldn't have to) and I don't want you to either.  Hmmmm.... underneath this box to fill in this review it says "If you believe that the product you are reviewing is unsafe or has a defect that could cause injury or death, please report this information immediately to the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) https://www.cpsc.gov/incident.html or contact Amazon.com directly at product-safety@amazon.com."

 A disappointing book that I picked up for the essays by Parry (liberation theory) and Brennan (a curious "alternative history" of postcolonial studies),  which were OK but not fantastic, and overall the book is dominated by straw-man arguments about postcolonial theory, squarely located within European epistemology. The introduction, ironically, suggests that "there needs to be a productive dialogue between Marxism and postcolonial studies", yet the examples of postcolonial studies mentioned in the book, such as Spivak, have of course given serious and detailed readings of Marx that are not taken particularly seriously here. More to the point, the entire tone is one of "debunking" and not at all exciting. If you're grumpy with all those postcolonial theorists supposedly taking over everything and you want to have arguments with them, or just make yourself feel better about liking your Adorno books more, this might be useful to you. 
 A quote from page 126:  "A good steak dinner laced with strychnine is farm more dangerous than a clearly marked bottle, especially if you are hungry."  Anyone hoping this book will help them understand homeschooling should know that it is a pro-spanking, fundamentalist Christian tome and not even clearly Biblical.   "Pain does teach!" and "Spanking is not hitting" take it outside the field of homeschooling, and perhaps Amazon should re-categorize it 
 I consider Charley Varrick Don Siegel's masterpiece and one of the very best American films of the '70s (and that's saying something), but Universal's  pathetic DVD release is an utter insult to the film and its fans.  I have written Universal to complain, and urge others to do the same.  Needless to say, I will not be purchasing 
 Not particularly musical; only 1 good track (Blues for Miles).. 
 All of the curse words are bleeped out. I just can't get past it. Why put in curse words if you're gonna bleep them? Its really irritating 
 I THOUGHT THE SELF TITLED ALBUM "THE GETO BOYS" WAS THE ORIGINAL VERSION.  IT SOUNDS MUCH BETTER.  THE RAPS ON THIS ALBUM SEEM LIKE THEY HAVE NO LIFE.  IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE PICK UP "THE GETO BOYS" TITLE INSTEAD. TRUST ME YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 The installation of this printer went very well.  However, after installing the printer my computer began running EXTREMELY slow.  I checked and it was using 100% of the CPU.  I stopped all the processes associated with this printer and my speed returned to normal.  I contacted HP and they said it is a known problem and they are working on it (that was six months ago).  They still are working on it.  HP's solution is to install the print driver only (so you cannot use the scan or fax feature) until they write new software for this printer.  They should have recalled the printer since it doesn't work properly.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINTER!!! 
 I very highly recommend this book for those who are interested not only in the public but private sides of A,B,B, and A. I was especially interested in tracing the paths each member took to finally arrive at their music we love.  I also learned what a difficult business selling music was and is, as well as something about Sweden and her people. Very enjoyable reading. 
 So much for revealing the "secrets" of Cabales Escrima. Unfortunatly this book is quite the opposite. Wiley misquotes Angel on the back cover. Angel gave permission for a series of books on Cabales Serrada Escrima - Not just one book with all the good techniques left out. I'm sure the Grand Master would have been bitterly dissapointed with this effort by Wiley. The idea was to spread the knowledge of this fantastic system throughout the world in its entirety through a series of books - Not for an insecure person to greedily hoard the techniques for himself to reveal at seminars and private tuition. 
 The author shares 8 "secrets" of financial success in this book.  Secret #1 Never pay off your mortgage because interest is tax-deductible. And if you investment your money in stocks (instead of pre-paying your mortgage) you will earn greater interest than what you're paying on your mortgage. WRONG. This "secret" has been wrong for almost five years now -- and would cost you plenty. The stock market is not a panacea. Besides, tax-deductibility is a non-issue for low-income retirees.  Secret #2 Don't diversify your retirement money -- put it all in stocks. WRONG. A mixture of stocks AND bonds is appropriate for almost everyone's retirement account. This author apparently knows nothing about portfolio theory and efficient frontiers. And this "secret" would have severely hurt anyone who is approaching retirement and kept their IRAs at 100% stocks during the bursting bubble & subsequent bear market.   Secret #3 Most of your wealth will come from investments of less than $1000. Sure it's good to start early, but the premise here is WRONG. The most money anyone makes in interest is in your last few years of holding an investment. In other words, most of your wealth comes at the end - when compounding interest is most strong. Imagine a small deposit to a mutual fund. Ten percent interest in your first year will be near-nothing. Ten percent interest on your investment in the fourtieth year is likely to be a number with six or seven figures. Thus most of your wealth will come from investments worth well more than $1,000.  Secret #4 You should rarely move from one investment to another. WRONG. While I agree with buy and hold, blindly following buy-and-hold advice will get you in trouble. Severely underperforming investments need to be harvested. And rebalancing (to keep your appropriate mix of stocks & bonds) should be performed yearly.   Secret #5 Don't measure your success against the Dow or S&P. WRONG and STUPID. You have no way of guaging the performance of your mutual funds or other investments unless you use a yardstick such as the S&P Dow or Wilshire. Perhaps the author knows the investments he sells are lemons, so he wants to discredit benchmarking. Sad.  Secret #6 Devote less than 3 hours per month to your finances. And budgeting is stupid. WRONG. 3 hours is an arbitrary number and some people will take longer, others less. Big deal. And budgeting is a *great* idea for those people who don't save enough.  Secret #7 Involve your kids in financial planning. OK, this one is right, but to teach your kids these "secrets" is WRONG and will doom them for life.   Secret #8 Don't pay attention to the financial media. WRONG. If you read this book then never pick up a legitimate piece of financial journalism again (WSJ, Barrons, Money, Andrew Tobias) you're screwed.   This book ranks among the worst of the financial planning books I've read.    Want good advice? Try "Personal Finance for Dummies" by Tyson or "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" by Tobias. Or simply go to vanguard.com and read their planning & advice section -- it's free, honest, and accurate! 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 Admittedly, the reason I read The Bourne Identity had everything to do with how much I enjoyed the recent film of the same name.  However, the book bears very little resemblance to the movie.  So little in fact that I wonder if the writers of the movie recognized the same weaknesses in the book as I did: shoddy writing, a confused and over-complicated plot, and a ridiculously juvenile, untenable love story.  I kept expecting the story to pick up and sweep me away as most great novels do, and I tried to gloss over my own revulsion at the soap opera dialog, and blaze undaunted through the remainder of the book...sort of like sitting through a movie you know you don't like much, but sticking around because you've already spent your money to see it.  The premise of the story is also hampered by a sort of cowboys and indians, good versus evil, over-simplified rationale on the part of Ludlum's characters.  Their motives are described plainly enough throughout the book, yet those motives are difficult to understand because they seem so casually overwrought.  Both Bourne and his nemesis, Carlos are laughably thin characterizations.  So much so that I found myself reminded time and time again of The Young and the Restless...especially when the story involved Marie.  Too often, her character came across as wooden and forced.  I don't buy her devotion to Bourne for a minute.  I was actually hoping that she would turn out to be an undercover agent or a psycho or something...anything to make her character more interesting or believable.  I have heard that the second and third books in this series are better, but The Bourne Identity doesn't give me enough reasons to find out for myself.  This is the only instance I've found where the movie is better than the book.  So, rather than waste four or five days slogging away at another Ludlum "best-seller," I'll just stick to the films, thanks 
 Esler as a fellow human being was not accessible to me as I read the book, though I truly wanted to warm up to him. For one who stresses an I-You approach to interpersonal relations, he sure didn't treat the authors with whom he interacted in his texts as "Yous".  And he sure didn't present himself as an authentic human being who makes himself vulnerably available to his reader. He seemed to me to be very dismissive of other scholars and authors. I know he wasn't writing for devotional purposes, but I was still disappointed with the lack of an uplifting and edifying character to the book. But if you want to read someone swimming with the current of modernity-bashing and smug anti-evangelicalism, here is your man.  I suppose I had hoped for more New Testament and more theology than Esler provides 
 Stay away from this phone.  The 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired. Picking up my last i530. If this one goes, Im canceling my Nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier. I've had it! Nextel and Motorola can't figure out that this phone is JUNK 
 As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!! 
 Bought this CD based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums I like, and man, what a mistake. This CD borders on unlistenable, with no discernable melody/talent to be found. I'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover...I consider "Blueberry Boat" to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible 
 If you require a guide to Smith's execrable 'White Teeth', then I regret to inform you that you are too stupid to live 
 Basically this book is an elaborate defense of promiscuity and hedonism.  I have liked his other books in the past (Skinny Legs and All is one of my all-time favorites) but this one didn't have enough insight to adequately place the elements of the story within a greater understanding of the world around us (usually one the greatest things about his writing. 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 I do SharePoint administration and development and own the other five SharePoint 2003 books currently on the market. This book is useless from any perspective except perhaps as a doorstop. It just repeats the same content chapter after chapter about the features of SharePoint while offering no insight as to installing, configuring or developing. You would get more insight about SharePoint reading a product brochure or just cruising Microsoft's web site. Avoid this book 
 I have been using this program for five years now and I'm finally going to switch to Quicken. The 'Invoice Designer' is a total waste of time... it just hasn't worked for years and Microsoft will do NOTHING to get it to work. This is the unwanted step child of Microsoft, so please don't waist your time 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 How can so many people rate this as a good movie?!?!?  It was downright horrible. It took over thirty minutes for any action to take place, if you want to consider her continuously walking to a bar as some action. Then a co-worker tries something with her, mind you, a CO-WORKER, whom she WORKS WITH. That just seemed like someone threw that scene in to show people that the main hero can fight.   The characters seem to not have aged in 15 years since the accident, her father, and the hero she ends up sleeping with. Come on, absolutely no reason why anyone with good movie tastes should rent this. I did and it was an absolute waste of time. 
 This book mostly skims over our history with not much information other than dates, instead referring you to all kinds of internet websites for the meat. Unfortunately, many of the websites no longer exist (although I bought the book almost as soon as it was released), or they just cannot be accessed with the addresses given, so the book is essentially useless. Given the life-expectancy of a lot of websites, it hardly seems like a wise concept by Barrons for an entire series of books. 
 This book attempts to teach young children about how to lead a simple life but instead tells them its bad to try to improve themselves. It's the only children's book I've ever thrown away 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 I have read some of her other books and I believe this one was not up to the others. I found the character very "whiney" and not very redeeming. This book seemed more "cookie cutter" and not as funny and/or clever as her others. I was disappointed-especially in the ending and her choices 
 This is a wonderfully researched book and well written as you'd expect from Mr. Owen, and I enjoyed reading it. But wondered if I was the only one who thought it was ruined by the obsessive desire to defend Cliff Roberts,  even on matters that really seem pointless. So I came here to read reviews  and I couldn't help but notice that many of the glowing reviews here on  Amazon appeared to be written by the same person, but I was glad to see  some agreed with me about the format of the book. I suppose it's a must for  the pictures if you want to see the course the way it once was, but I  recommend avoiding it if you get irritated with a book that has an agenda  and seems to go out of its way to not just tell the story, but to address  issues that someone wanted addressed 
 Some very basic information provided regarding natural hair. Not what I expected from the book 
 Many, many years ago I read Catherine Coulter, read her avidly, eagerly looking forward to her next book. Well, this is the first one of hers that I have read in about a decade and WHAT HAPPENED? Three times I set this book down in disgust, only to come back to it out of sheer stubbornness.  There is not enough room to write about just how bad this book was. From generally poor writing (Mary Lisa said, Jack said, Lou Lou said... until you want to yell "I KNOW who is involved in this conversation!), silly plot, unneccessary side stepping.   WHO CARES that the hero digs a chunky chip into guacamole? OH WOW, we get to know the different flavors of potato chips being devoured by three woman while they talk about the big case. WHEN have any of us heard of investigating cops asking "why is she wearing those pajamas when you are wearing those"? YEAH sure, an agent involved in a case is going to let endangered person call the shots in even the tiniest part of the investigation. And the names! Mary Lisa? Lou Lou? Puker? Gimme a freaking break! Aaaarrrrggggg!!!   Ms. Coulter, I used to love your books. PLEASE get back to what you used to do so well. If you cannot write the "FBI style" books that are so popular now, then don't. STOP feeding the bestseller beast anything less than your best. Cease. Desist. Please go back to what you are great at 
 Wish I would have paid attention to this one, the the previous review.  The cost for what you get is OUTRAGEOUS.  Only reason I gave it one star is because there was no place to give is ZERO starts.  Don't waste your money like I did!!!  FIND A MORE ECONOMICAL PRODUCT (plenty more choices on Amazon BTW) 
 The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the "Just say no" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack 
 I can't remember ever reading a  book that I enjoyed less. The Easy person is so forced that no one would or could believe him. I,ve read other books by Mosley, but this, Easy Rawlins should just go away. 
 I ordered this yoga pant in black. The item I received has a very large split up the outside of each leg which is not shown in the pictures of the item and is not mentioned in the product description. The item appears so different in person that I could only assume I was sent the wrong item. The seller Athletic allows returns on merchandise but will not refund shipping charges. When I contacted the seller Athletica to say I didn't think I should have to bear the cost of shipping to me ($7.75) and then return shipping to them for their error in either shipping the wrong item or not appropriately portraying the product, they refused to do anything about the shipping costs and they tried to blame Amazon for the picture on the website rather than accepting any responsibility. I will not order from this seller again, and I would caution others against doing so either 
 Ms. Klausner's review gave me pause.  As satire, this book would have been interesting and would have merited her glowing review.  Unfortunately, I think the author was utterly serious with this book.  The turgid focus is mindnumbing, without ever being attractive or interesting.  The perpetrators of the central mystery are obvious.  And yet...Mr. Ryan can write.  He held my interest all the while I said "this is appalling, what a narrowminded, pig".  I would buy a paperback of the sequel in December to see how the lead character changes, now that she is leaving being a tigress behind 
 I thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget.  I was wrong.  Instead, it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, on all kinds of architectural extravagances.  Perhaps this book could have a subtitle:  How to spend a million dollars on a 1,500 square foot house.  If you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply, this is the wrong book 
 I was first introduced to Omar Tyree with his novel "Leslie" and I absolutely loved it! I then decided to check out other novels he had written. I read "Flyy Girl" first which, I liked as well and followed it with "For The Love of Money", which was a Big Disappointment! They always say sequels are bad and this novel proved that theory. The novel starts off with the end of the story and in the middle of the novel right when it is going to climax you realize the connection between the beginning and the end and loose interest because you already know the ending of the novel. The novel did not keep my interest and seemed rather long. This novel could have been summed up in one chapter and used for the Prologue to "Boss Lady". After reading "For The Love of Money", I am not interested in reading the sequel "Boss Lady" at all! Why make a sequel to something that is so bad 
 Folks, this is a cautionary tale -- not the content of "Satan Burger" mind you, but the fact that it exists. Was it self published? If so, please let somebody professional in the craft of writing take a look at your work before you put it out there. Otherwise you wind up with something like this, a bathroom-y, high school type mishmash of unconnected writing. Not that there isn't a spark here, an exuberance, but jeeze...   I guess I should have been warned off by the cover, truely off-putting, but I am a fan of surrealist, dystopian sci-fi, and was suckered in by the reviews. I can usually get through a book if the ideas are interesting, even if the writing is sub-par -- that's what you often get if you like more alternative sci-fi. But even my lowest expectations were left far behind in this one.   Just a friendly warning. 
 I am a big fan of Dick's. His short stories are his strength, his imagination is superb, but this novel is peculiar to say the very least. I am well aware that a major criticism of his body of work is the uneven writing. Sometimes he soars, but at other times it feels as though he wrote a book in a week and stuffed it in an envelope and mailed it off to the publisher without giving it another thought. This is just such a book. How it won the John W. Campbell Memorial award for the best novel of 1974 is beyond me. It would never get published today.  The beginning is classic Dick: a famous man wakes up in  a flophouse after a murder attempt on his life and finds that he doesn't exist. No records, no biography, fame all gone, a pocket full of money, that's it. But from that point on the story lumbers from one encounter with a ditzy woman to another. It's all rambling filler that has nothing to do with the story. The policeman in the title doesn't show up until halfway through. Granted, the story picks up a bit at that point, but then it loses its focus again and the ending is a rush job if ever there was one. The whole thing turns out to be a drug induced figment of his imagination. How disappointing is that? That's as bad as  those Star Trek time travel episodes where everyone goes through absolute hell, they should all be traumatized for life and suffer from terminal PTSD, but then the loop is completed and it's as though none of it ever happened. Arghhh!   If you think Dick was one of the great Sci-Fi masters of all time, read this book, but keep it in context with his corpus of work (i.e. somewhere in the bottom half). If you are just starting to read Dick, skip this one for a while. But by all means read his short stories. Some of them are keepers for all time.  
 In a word...disappointing.  On phono input, the treble is fine, but if you're looking for any kind of bass, two dixie cups and a string would work as well.  If you're thinking of purchasing this item...set your expectations LOW 
 I read the prior reviews and was sold on the book. How disapointing once I got it! This book is for kids? Please, it is so lame and unatractive to children. It's black and white and boring and dull. Save your money 
 I am an avid reader and could not make it through this book. His other books were so good. I could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be. In applying some of the recommended techniques, my 11 year old daughter, Emily, thought I lost my mind. Thank goodness things are back to normal. We are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice 
 Okay if you want an idea of what this new series is all about picture a bunch of hi-tech hippies with super powers in space. Well that's the feeling it gave me at least. I mean there is this big social movement called the Legion that most parents despise as being a bad influence on society and the kids all think the adults don't get it and only they have the answers. And society is sterile and individuality is frowned upon. Sounds like a hippie rehash of the sixties to me. For me this trade just didn't have any kind of spark to it at all. Just a bunch of disfunctional future heroes arguing with each other.  
 Unfortunately, my 6 yr old son did not like it and was very disappointed. You can't see the aliens very well through the little peep hole in the watch. He doesn't want anything to do with it and I spent way too much money to get it delivered before Christmas. I was so disappointed because he loves Ben 10.  Bummed out Mom : 
    I'm a fan of Audrey Hepburn and this movie relys heavily - too heavily on her charm.  And unfortunately, it is some of her worst acting work, posey, sing-song, and superficial.  Now, if you've read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static.    Like most Heburn films, a highlight is her clothes, her style, her self.  This film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better.  There are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here.  This film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead.  Jayne Mansfield could have been a hoot in this, Thelma Ritter too, in a very different way, somebody with less style and more off beat snap, crackle, and pop.  (Thelma Ritter and William Holden paired in a romantic comedy... I'm all ready laughing!)    Before I hit this too harshly, this film was intended to be a trifle, the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles.  For that, it is adequate.    The remake, ALEX AND EMMA suffers very much from the same problems.  They actually improved the script, and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices, but both films seem to have suffered from "settling for a star" when a less mainstream, more zany actress was needed.  OK, this doesn't stink...it has Audrey, but it certainly doesn't sizzle 
 Lurid, disjointed, unfulfilling...Her Wolf books are interesting and Dragon Queen was written well enough that I bought Raven in hardback, but this book is a bit offensive.  She uses sex as filler and her use of modern language sets the wrong tone and jangles the nerves. Some sequences in the book are interesting, but most are too dreamlike to make sense or just plain stupid, ie the big cat talking and licking himself, etc.. 
      Millet attempts in his book to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The author addresses a controversial subject; namely, is Mormonism Christian? While he uses somewhat persuasive arguments (convincing Mormons, the uninformed, and those unknowledgeable in sound Christian doctrine), his arguments don't hold up under the light of Biblical truth. Having spent 26 years of my life as a devout Mormon, and leaving Mormonism for a saving relationship with Jesus Christ of the Bible, I know from experience there is a big difference in what the Holy Bible teaches about Jesus and what the Mormon (LDS) Church teaches about Jesus. Millet is a sincere individual, but he has no authority to speak in behalf of LDS 'prophets,' contradicting what they have taught since the founding of Mormonism. The book overlooks statements by Mormon leaders who have emphasized that Mormonism is NOT Christian and that the Christ they teach and believe in is NOT the Christ of traditional Christianity.       For example, "We talk about Christianity, but it is a perfect pack of nonsense...It is a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol: it is as corrupt as hell; and the Devil could not invent a better engine to spread his work that the Christianity of the nineteenth century" (John Taylor, LDS prophet, Journal of Discourses, vol. 6, p. 167). Or even more recently, "In bearing testimony of Jesus Christ, President Hinckley spoke of those outside the Church who say Latter-day Saints `do not believe in the traditional Christ.' No, I don't. The traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I speak. For the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in this the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times" (Deseret News, Church News section, Salt Lake City, Utah, week ending June 20, 1998, p. 7).       If you are interested in warm-fuzzy, feel-good, ecumenical theology, you will probably enjoy this book. However, if you are interested in Truth and knowing the REAL Jesus Christ, the One Who can offer genuine salvation, flee from the false christ of Mormonism. Take everything the author says with a pound of salt and do your own research. You will see for yourself that the Mormon Jesus and the Christian Jesus are as different as night and day 
 I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids.  4% Iron and no other vitamins??  With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions, why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories?? It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST!! OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke!! I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species!! But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN 
 This book is the Emperor's New Clothes of literature. Critics fall all over themselves to praise it for fear of not seeming sufficiently erudite. I think Morrison is secretly laughing at all of them 
 Regrettably, this book simply fails to prove its central thesis: that from earliest times, Jesus was simply included within the unique identity of God. First, Bauckham is absolutely incorrect that Jewish monotheism was in any sense "strict" in Jesus' day. As is becoming increasingly clear, the type of monotheism he thinks Jews followed in the first century does not even begin to come about till the 3rd century. Even scholars as conservative as N T Wright acknowledge this.  Second, he dismisses the Enoch literature too easily, as well as large amounts of the Pseudepigrapha. Clearly, Jews were capable of thinking of of more than one divine figure along with God. Even a simple reading of I Enoch will reveal that.  Third, he dismisses other evidence that, according to his criteria, would make other patriarchs like Moses be included in God's unique identity. As can be easily seen from Larry Hurtado's One God, One Lord, Jews could conceive of exalted figures exercising divine prerogatives--without monotheism having to be rethought! If the exercise of divine prerogatives=divinity, Jewish literature abounds with Trinities.  Fourth, he underestimates the *earliest* Christology: Jesus was a man accredited by God. Christ is clearly subordinated--both functionally and ontologically--to God; Bauckham ignores the Pauline evidence for this. Paul continually speaks of "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"; that God worked "through" Jesus; that there is "one God and one Lord". But this he ignores because a few passages in the NT seem to indicate otherwise. In other words, the rabbit he pulls out of the hat is one he had to put in there in the first place.  In other words, his thesis fails on every single point by making gross generalizations and by ignoring massive amounts of evidence, dismissing anything that counters his argument as irrelevant. This is not good scholarship; this is making texts say what he wants them to say.  This is hardly to deny the Trinity; nor is it to say that there is not other evidence for it (see Neil Richardson's brilliant "Paul's Language about God"). It is merely to say that THIS book proves absolutely nothing, other than the author is desperately grabbing at anything that will prove his point. 
 Shaw, who more than any of his contemporaries dealt provocatively with the crucial issues of his day, has not worn well.  In a 1971 encyclopaedia I had as a child, the entry on GBS called him the greatest dramatist since  Shakespeare.  That's better than Moliere, Sheridan, Strindberg, Ibsen,  Wilde, Jarry, Chekhov, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett!  Such a laughable  proposition is untenable today, and we can now see Shaw for what he is - a  superficially amusing farceur, who squandered this modest gift on deadly  social comment, deadly because he reduced issues that effected real people  to theorems, and reduced those people to mere mouthpieces.  There is no  subtext in Shaw - everything is expounded tediously and teeth-grindingly on  the surface.   ARMS AND THE MAN is one of his better efforts, and, after an  uncertain start, settles into some nice old-style farce - hidden  identities, buffoonish heroes, scheming servants, crusty old majors; when,  though, the puppets start lecturing us on war, idealism, class, gender  etc., one's heart sinks, not because what Shaw says isn't true, but because  a letter to the Times would have been a better place to say it.  While  Wilde's plays grow with the years, seeming richer, more meaningful,  brutally satiric, bursting with complex and fluid themes, Shaw's work, in  their steadfast refusal of mystery and ambiguity, seem chilly and remote 
 I was tired of replacing wires on my old cheese slicer every couple of years.  The blade "bends" through a block of cheese.  It doesnt provide a straight cut.  
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 Gene Cernan is one of America's most experienced and successful astronauts. His three missions were among the most ambitious, successful and exciting of all time. He spent more time, along with partner Harrison Schmitt, than any other man walking on the moon. It was, therefore, with great disappointment that I read this book. What I expect from a book by an astronaut is to really feel and understand what the unique experiences they went through were like and what challenges-physical, mental and technical they overcame. With the notable exception of Mike Collins' autobiography almost none of the astronauts books really provide this. Only 12 men have ever stood on the moon and yet they have not really conveyed what this and other aspects of spaceflight were like in their autobiographies. He dismisses his epic Apollo 17 flight in a few pages and spends more time talking about the politics of crew selection, giving crude descriptions of his wife's figure and other trivia. Also there is a lack of illustrations showing the alien environment he explored so well. Most of the astronauts who wrote autobiographies felt they had to talk down to their audience to make the book attractive to the average reader, thus leaving out much technical information that is actually quite interesting, even for the non-technically-minded layman.  The popularity of the film "Apollo 13" and the television series "From the Earth to the Moon" in which technical matters were not shied away from proves this is not true.  The fact is the true intelligence and abilities of these men is measured in what they did on their space missions, not as golfers or in planning practical jokes or in celebrity namedropping.  In a more positive light, he reveals for the first time the real dangers the Gemini spacewalks entailed and gives a good description of the problems Ed White encountered in Gemini 4 and his own nightmarish experience in Gemini 9.  
 There's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted. This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought. I did not do much research. I think the data may be in there, but I could not learn how to make it work. The interface is horrific - unusable. Don't do it 
 This could possibly be the worst book I have ever read.  As a morbidly obese person I was looking for some support to help overcome my obsession with food.  I do agree with the author that addiction is a choice.  However, other than the last page and a half of the book which enforced the ideas of choice; I found this book to be some sort of vendetta against AA & religion.  My father was an alcoholic and I attended many AA meetings with him.  While AA may not be perfect, they certainly have helped a lot of people.  In addition AA is easily accessable to people who need help.    I feel Dr. Schaler came off as arrogant and intollerant of anyone who has some sort of addiction.  While I don't feel that addiction is a disease; I do feel that there is some almost uncontrollable compulsion that leads people to make bad choices in their lives.  When someone is controlled by addiction to a substance or behavior that is unhealthy and unacceptable by society this person can exist in a living hell.  One would think the pesonal shame and self hatred a person who has these "addictions" lives with would be encouragement enough to quit.  Unfortunately addicts I have known have had to maintain complete abstinence from their addictive substance or behavior.  I am an over eater.  I cannot totally stop eating.  However, I do need to maintain a certain controlled lifestyle in order to keep my eating under control.  When I step away from my controlled routine I gradually, over a couple of days, will lose control over what I am eating.  For someone who has an addiction to try to entertain that activity moderately just doesn't work.  While I agree with Dr. Schaler that we all need to take responsibility for our choices, I do not feel his book is objectively written.  He is totally unfair to AA when he refers to it as a religious cult.  Also, some people are able to find religion and fill their lives with a spirituality they never were able to experience with a substance or behavior 
 The problem with so many how-to books (this one included) is that they spend page after page telling you what they are going to tell you, then talking to you about what they are about to tell you what it is you are wanting to know ... and then telling you.  Oh, yeah:  after that they tell you what they already told you.  And then the rest of the book is filled with "well this isn't related to our thesis, but you might be interested in this other stuff anyway."  I'll save you the $38 cover price right now ... this book tells you but one practical thing:  publish a detailed operations manual for your business.  That's it!  Nada!  Finis!  Unless you, as a business owner, believe that half a page offering recommendations in FONT STYLES is important, you are well advised to stay away.  This book is a rip-off 
 This timer is inadequate in two ways.  First, the volume of the beep is too low and can't be heard more than two feet away.  Secondly, the LED began malfunctioning after a few months and made the readout illegible.  I wouldn't buy this again 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 Let me start out by being fair - if you know a lot about Indian history/culture this book MAY interest you even if the first 50 pgs. are excruciatingly slow. Otherwise, you will have a hard time understanding the value behind what the characters do. The whole plot revolves around the woman's place in Indian society & more specifically, Bimla's conflict with her brother, Raja. The conflict seems to begin resolving itself in the last 15 pgs, but the author does not take the time to write out the final scene between sister & brother. Very difficult book to enjoy with no satisfactory conclusion 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 There is no need to pick up this book and read the reviews on the back because they are misleading, and there's no reason to read the book unless required for a class.  You can capture the essence of the story from the beginning and believe, me the story doesn't change throughout.  I forged on to finish the book thinking there would be some wonderful climax to the story or turn of events but found the same old boring characters and story with lack of depth, and if I'd stopped at the beginning of the book I wouldn't have missed anything.  Leopards don't change their spots and neither did Dangerfield.  As far as the writing goes, a grade school child could've written half of it.  Not a literary wizard in my mind.  I was recommended this book when at Greane's bookstore in Dublin and was told it was very funny.  Not so.  Not funny.  Don't read it and be led on that it must get better as you go because it does not 
 For years I have been trying to find a book to replace, The Right Dog for You, by Daniel F. Tortora, because his book now does not include an number of breeds. I thought The Perfect Match might be the one. What a disappointment. I wanted to learn about the breeds and how they react and interact in their environments. Some breeds have more information, but there are no cautions about puppy mills or the effect they have on the breed. There is no consistent information about heriditary defects, the life-span. This is not a buyers guide, it doesn't give you the information to make the educated decision a buyer of this book is hoping to make. I wish Tortora would write another book 
 USELESS ITEM.  DO NOT PURCHASE. ITEM IS A WASTE OF MONEY. COMPANY WILL NOT ACCEPT A RETURN YOU CANNOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.  COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.  THE MOTORIZED VERSION PERFORMS AS ADVERTISED 
 This is pretty much a useless waste of an SD card.  The little programs on it are of not much use.  All of them can be downloaded as Freeware off the net.  I'm glad I only paid 95 cents for it, that's more that it's worth 
 First off I belive that this would have been better if written by Greg Cox. Mr Hanna has probably only seen about 2 minutes of an episode because in this book he makes Sydney seem weak (which we all know she is not), He didn't really give the main Charater much to do since she had was injured and what got on my nerves the most was that he had Sydney call Vaughn "Michael" (which she NEVER does) and has people call Dixon "Marcus". For a second when I was reading the book I had to think of who this "Marcus" was. So overall this is a book that you can skip. You won't be missing anything.   
 The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though 
 Besides not living up to the quality of content found in their other videos (like Lifelines), the sound quality of the VHS version was unbearably BAD (as in unlistenable)!I recorderd my own version from a PBS airing, on a $49 VHS machine that was far superior to the complete garbage that was sent to me, when I ordered this tape. I really should return it to the seller 
 Unless you are an advertising industry buff or somehow admire Mary Wells Lawrence this book is just average.  There are a few interesting spots but for the most part she is just talking herself up 
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 This book is a shameless mishmash of speculation and misdirection that only obscures the extraordinary voyages of the Chinese 15th century mariners. There are some good books out there about the Zheng He voyages - read them instead of this tripe 
 Harold Lloyd may have been a brilliant man but they clearly didn't know much about 3-D photography back then. The stereoscopic displacement just doesn't work quite right--the image never really aligns well, and many of the images resist being resolved by the eyes 
 I've read both Darwin's Radio and its successor, Darwin's Children. The real star of the show here is the evolutionary change itself. Bear's 2D characters drag both books down. Unfortunate, because this would make for a great SF read if the characters weren't so single-minded & cardboardlike. 
 This is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter.  The suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out.  The suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big (duh) and then group like items together (duh) that's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other.  Also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system.  Oh is that affordable? If I had $75,000 to redo my kitchen I would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins.  Come on, don't waste your money on this book or it's suggestions.  Very few pictures and all for the rich.  I thought Good Housekeeping was for the everyday family.  Get it at the library and then return it after you don't read it.  
 I bought this wok 6 months ago. I seasoned it very well and started to use it. But I noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when I cooked the dish with a lot of sauce. It meant I couldn't use it for steaming. When I made a fried rice, I had a hard time to clean it and re-season it. Most Chinese use a wok to cook everything, so I expected I could do that, too. But I was wrong. This wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry. That's all 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 I find myself in the minority with these reviewers.  "Emma" in this book is the same character as the "Shopoholic" series main character (whose name I have forgotten already).    After reading the Shopoholic series, I was hoping to find a bit of something different in this book and I was disappointed.    The "Emma" character is flaky, shallow and insecure and for the most part so untrue to herself that I find myself (same as in reading the "shopoholic" series) hoping that something horrid will happen to her because she's so annoying and unrealistic.  And yet, the great successful rich man falls in love with her for being her quirky honest self.  I sincerely believe in being honest in relationships too, I agree with the theme that you should be yourself and not settle, that was the best part of this book.    However, I'm left feeling like the rich successful man wouldn't have fallen in love with her if she wasn't a (in her words fat) size six(which is a US size four).  Please.  It's always a lot more believeable that the man really likes her for who she is if the main character isn't so "perfect" physically.    Good things about this book and author:  Good escapism, can read book in a day, good English references.  This is why I keep buying the author's books, perhaps hoping one of them will be more realistic.  So far hasn't happened.  But we all love reading some fantasy/fluff once in a while, and for that I'm grateful for this book. 
 This book is awful.  Nowhere near as good as Dumas' better known work 
 Forget Summers, Father Satan has already dealt with him and all those hypocritical fools who thought they could play around with the demons, hold them in chains, and embarrass them. The demons are free now and anyone who wants to follow Montague Summers can join him in Satan's personal chamber of torment. That is his price to pay for agreeing with all those witchburnings, hahaha. I'm glad he's dead. May he suffer in Hell 
 I had to use this book as a student for my discrete mathematics course. I hated it. I found this book hard to understand and follow. The ideas weren't clearly explained. There were lots of problems at the end of the section that were barely or not at all explained in the chapter. There were only a limited number of examples in each chapter, and most of the examples finished with "the proof to this is left as an exercise to the reader." If this is a book designed to teach discrete mathematics, I would assume the reader wants something that wouldn't leave every example as an "exercise" to the reader. I want a book that gives examples, lots of them, and finishes each one. This book could use a lot more of that 
 This is a tract, not a thoughtful piece of scholarship. It is in the Latin American school of angry social science, but is little informed by fact.  Much of what it says is correct, but is also well known.  But the analysis is weak, based on incorrect or outdated data, and simply a regurgitation of stereotypes instead of a deductive grounded analysis based upon good ethnographic work.   It is therefore often simply wrong.  But anger sells books.... 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 I must admit I only bought this because Allison DuBois' web site fires a broadside at the author. I had to know what had her all riled up. You don't need a 'gift' to see that it's probably annoyance that Dr Schwartz has successfully tied himself to her famous apron strings and made some tidy coin from cashing in on her fame. I' be annoyed too, especially if I had written such a thoroughly disappointing book as Mrs Dubois' Don't Kiss Them Goodbye. Even with all her powers she couldn't 'see' the benefit of collaborating with a skilled writer. Dr Schwartz, on the other hand, has teamed up with William L Simon who manages to maintain the reader's interest through a story that is stretched over far too many pages. Although I found myself skimming at times I did read it through to the end.  I hoped for more, a lot more. I found myself looking at the back cover hoping for a free voucher for the rest of the book when it is written. No, just a dust jacket with carefully chosen praise.  I detected a hint of jealousy and desperation from Gary E Schwartz who seems to believe he deserves more attention for his pseudo-scientific work than those he believes have special abilities. Mr Schwartz does have a special gift himself though; the ability to wring every last micro-drop of benefit from a former association with someone immortalised by television. I have my doubts about how much his tests really prove but I was willing to suspend my disbelief and go along for the ride.  Here's a tip dear reader: even if you are psychic don't try to read too much into this book. It's just what it seems to be 
 The first two chapters kept my interest, but then, I became bored. I hate it when I don't finish a book, but this was too dry to me. I felt there wasn't enough instruction on overcoming the fears. I also tired of all of the excerpts from other books. It seemed on every page there was another excerpt from another author's book. Call me picky, I just couldn't get into it. 
 I've been through this book a few times now.  I admit that Pooh seems a good Taoist, if I remember my theology classes right.  I will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time.  Where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator's tone.  Mr. Hoff's contrasts between Taoist and Judeo-Christian approaches to life invariably give the air of self-satisfaction one so often finds in Western converts to Eastern religion.  It is this pall of smug (apologies to Trey Parker and Matt Stone) that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn.    I'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation, were it not for the tone 
 This is the book I had in my college biology course. I find this book to be quite inconsistent. While it has it's bright spots and explains some things very well, it is one of those books where you end up having to hunt for the information. Result? You spend a great deal of time deciphering the book which has the information strewn everywhere in a fashion that's not entirely organized. Not to mention the fact that it stops dead cold in the middle of explaining a concept in order to go into great detail about another related concept. Then suddenly it jolts the reader back to what it was talking about beforehand. A good and elementary example of this is in chapter 2 where they discuss hydrogen bonding. It veers off and on from what the topic is supposed to be. It would be more helpful to cut to the chase and leave the lengthly prose out of the book. As another reviewer pointed out, the fact that the book has so many different authors is just ASKING for the final product to be inconsistent. This book is not worth the 120 dollars they expect you to pay for it. 
 I almost didn't finish this book.  I skipped/skimmed huge parts just to try and make it to the end.  I finally realized I didn't CARE what happened to any of these characters.  It was terribly slow in so many places.  I bought this at the airport - big mistake 
 Improbable people in implausible situations driven by too-convenient motivations.  A thin veneer about anthropology, development, political philosophy, and Africa that drags the story along but does little to enlighten.  Obviously written with a well-thumbed thesaurus at hand, the author's vocabulary use is more tortured than inspiring.  (Or, as Mark Twain put it, "it grates on the fastidious ear.")  A decent plot, but a snoozer in its execution.  The characters are drawn with multi-layered histories that are informational but exact no empathy.  
 This has got to be the most S*~^est Movie ever. It completeley ruined the Friday the 13th Series! Jason did not have Hair and was deformed as a Child  He was on a Boat for most of the Movie, and appeared in New York at the End!  Why the Hell did Jason turn back into a Boy at the End, when he Melted in the Toxic Waste  Jason's Face is just F$"#ing Stupid at the End. I mean Seriously. He looks like Zippy from F$"#ing Rainbow. Why did they even make it? 
 The first 5 minutes of the film are the best for me.  It is a flash back to 1913 with the children working in the mines.  After that you are brought to current times with a mother and 2 daughters traveling into the mountains to an old family home they have inherited from their deceased husband/father.  That is about all the story there is other than the zombie children killing people.  The zombie children are just kids with some grey makeup and black eyes wearing old clothes.  They were not really scary, not did the director or story set up any good scares.  This film has some real potential.  The acting is actually pretty solid, it is the story that really brings this one down.  So far the weakest of the horrorfest movies I have watched 
 Being a big girl myself, I was actually looking forward to this book the first time I picked it up. Then I started reading..  The story itself is basic and that isn't exactly disappointing. The wording is. It is clear from the way the book is written that the author certainly doesn't find fat even remotely beautiful. From themes on how fat women are, clearly, only fat because they're pressured so hard to be thin that they overeat..to the overused emphasis on "rolls and bumps" and how even the main character sees these things as horrid and negative. I was truly disgusted when I finished this book.    If you are going to write a book and market it under the idea of an "uplifting" sort of story, then please make the attempt at making the book something other than a "why am I fat?" lesson. 
 I think this book might be helpful for the professional interior decorator. It was just not what I was looking for in a color book. Each section generally starts with a page or two of colors squares, i.e yellow or yellow-orange. It then describes the color (A very 1950's yellow, warm and dense. Look at it with only the colors below and the three to the left). These pages are then followed with photos of rooms using some of the colors. The entire book is arranged this way. The red rooms are almost completely red (page 5-6) and very few of the rooms were my particular taste or style. Some of the color palettes that were used together seemed more jarring than coordinated, except when the author got to the more sedate, calmer colors (pg, 32, 38).  I prefer the BH&G - Color Schemes book which has a more realistic and useable color palette and presents them in beautifully decorated rooms. Again, this one might be more useful to the professional decorator, but for me it was too much text and history 
 The plot's not bad.  Most of the writing is adequate, but with occasional lapses.  It's full of repeated single word sentences "Hist.", "List.", and sometimes "Hie.", clumsy archaisms, and plain bad writing.  For instance, on pages 32 (of the ominbus volume) we find  "His vitals turned."   and on the next page,   "Tek feinted clumsily twice, three times with her horn, but missed each time."  (she confuses feint with lunge in several places)  The Amazon blurb says "reading level: ages 9-12".   9-12 year olds probably won't mind, but I don't recommend it for adults 
 I like many others have had major issues with this crock pot burning everything I make. I lent it to my sister in law for Christmas, ahe has another brand pot at home and hers did not burn at all, or boil. Mine had the same food in it and was boiling and burned the dish. Even on low it boils and burns. I will be contacting Rival now that Iknow that I am not the only one....  I would not recommend this brand or unit.. 
  Review title says it all!  If you've read any of her other stuff, this will be totally boring.  She has explained most of the chakra stuff in her other books.  If I had to read anyone else's chakra-related story, I was gonna scream!!  Can't think of any reason to purchase or read this one 
 Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers 
 Starting a series in the middle is always tough, but I'm a firm believer that readers should be able to enter the path at any point and feel welcomed. Johansen does a good job of giving enough of the backstory on her characters (forensic scluptor Eve Duncan, her adopted daughter Jane, and her live-in love Joe Quinn) that I understood what was going on.  She also set up an interesting plot line -- a body-less skull, a mysterious letter in the mail, a betrayal by Joe -- that I was pulled in immediately.  Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. Eve is a narcissist who seems to act with little regard to her family, the other characters seem to exist solely to serve her will (doesn't Joe have any passions or needs of his own?), and the plot was splotchy and haphazard. Twists and turns appeared without any apparent foresight by the author other than, "Wow, this will fool 'em!" I was left with more questions than were answered. Not a good end to a mystery. 
 It is not the Tracy Chapman you will be expecting to hear. This album is a complete disaster. I wish I had not bought it.  
 I didn't like the book because it has no action.Paul Fliechman, the only action you had was when sae young got beat up and thats what I thought about SEED FOLKS.        
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 I was shocked at just how bad this book was given the high ratings.  What did people find to like?  The dialogue and internal monologue is uniformly written in short, choppy simple sentences-- like a bad film noir movie.  The basic premise isn't explained well enough, even once the protagonist recovers from amnesia.  This leaves the readers plodding through action scenes (again with no interesting detail typically) without understanding why the battle, overall journey or any of the characters matter.  Avoid this stinker 
 Reading the book one wonders if Joseph Goldstein has read his own introduction. He tells us a very nice story how a Korean Zen monch and a Tibetan Lama misunderstand each other. So obviously there is a problem with buddhists from different traditions understanding each other. More than a thousand years of different development of Zen and Tibetan buddhism have made it difficult to define the one dharma that unites them both. And there are other schools. Now how does western Buddhism comes in? Can it perhaps help to define this one buddha dharma? Or is it perhaps inventing something new? Very interesting questions, but no answer will be found in this book. It reads much more like a traditional introduction into buddhism written by a western teacher with some emphasis on Theravada. Nothing wrong with it, I liked to read the book, but the title just does not fit. The books of Lama Surya Das are clearly superior in approaching the question of an emerging western buddhism. And hard to beat 
 I got this book hoping it would be helpful. It was very heavy on the side of psychology, which is of very little help in parenting or life. If a reader feels the field of psychology is worth while, they will probably find this book to be of use. While there were some good points they were few and far between. While readers of books can eat the meat and spit out the bones, this was something like trying to eat tilapia 
 oh my gosh my scene dolls are so ugly i feel like puking whenever i see them they are very inapporpriate peoples buy bratz they are pretty and fun to play with and they have coolio clothes 
 I'm having fun with this book, but at the same time i get extremely frustrated with it!  i love doing the tricks, but some (about 1/4) instructions are just written very poorly, then i give up on that trick :(    i'm needing to read some tricks over and over to understand the mechanics of it (not becuase the trick is hard to do, but because i can't figure out exactly WHAT TO DO, becuase the instructions are unclear, and the english is funky)  i recommend the a newer version of this book which might have better english.   GET THE NEWER ONE! 
 This is surely one of the worst movies ever made, and may indeed take the title.  No one can act, the plot (was there a script?) is absurd, the music is dreadful, and the director must have been high much of the time.  This comedy/horror film is neither funny nor slasher-enjoyable.  It's simply stupid.  Have we as a people actually reached the point of cultural degradation symbolized by this film?  I saw this in prime time on the Independent Film Channel.  It has permanently forfeited its reputation 
 This book is heavily oriented towards Christians and a Biblical motivation for marriage.  I picked this up after reading Chapman's "Five Love Languages," which was inspired by his faith but grounded in observation and study of real people.  "Hope for the Separated" does offer good advice on how to approach living apart, what to do with the time, how to approach reconcilliation, etc.  Unfortunately, the only motivation given for reconcilliation, as opposed to divorce, is that the Bible says so. While this is enough for many, the approach of "Five Love Languages" led me to expect something more widely applicable.  In sum, this book provides much of the "How" but not a whole lot of "Why," unless a Biblical explaination is all the "Why" that you need 
 In a society that tends to believe in creationism, Wells continues the politically correct campaign to change minds through public appeal instead of research.  Science is a slow process that requires evidence presented to academic peers for the process of a slow paradigm shift to occur.  Since ID has no evidence other than a longing from the dominant political group in the US, it is nothing more than faith.    Wells does a good job of citing numerous scientists, admitting that they are evolutionists, yet finding their disagreements with evolution.  He uses the process and characteristics of science (peer reviews and tentative conclusions) to challenge the general tenet that evolution is the fundamental process of biology.  Wells would like to win the media battle, but that has already been decided, and ID/creationism wins.  However, science is not democratic.  Evidence is required and supernatural processes do not provide the necessary information.  Wells, and other supporters of supernatural processes, will continue to get support from the general public until science education recieves proper support.  
 What I don't like about these is the way you have to position them in the cradle to make sure they charge.  I bought these for my elderly father and he's having a hard time positioning them correctly - and if they're not positioned correctly they won't charge

 It came highly recommended by a local bookshop so I was really looking forward to getting started.  Unexpectedly, I was very quickly put off, amongst other things, by the jarring, clever-clever literary references  that seemed more to be to do with an ego-trip for the author than anything  that added to the story.  Confused, I gave up after just twenty pages 
 I've been using this for oatmeal, and it doesn't work that great.  I like to use 1/2 cup oatmeal with 1 cup of water.  The dispensor doesn't have a regular amount of oatmeal that comes out - sometimes it might be 3 clicks, other times 4 or 5.  Part of the problem is the flexible rubber blades that dispense the product 
 This was probably written to be a lab manual for a class.  I bought it as a professional to polish up on my DSP.  It contains "hands on" exercises in Matlab to demonstrate DSP principles.  My two main gripes are the same with this book as most other engineering books and are as follows:  (1) it is not written to it's intended audience - the student.  It is written for the professor (ie the authors colleagues) and (2) it contains no solutions (as a previous reviewer stated).  I would also like to point out that Matlab 5 is "old" now and some of the functions used in this book have been renamed in the later version of Matlab.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK 
 Hendrik Olaerts is 100% correct in his review (19 May 2006), when he describes this book as "outdated." But I feel more needs to be said, and my opinion of this book differs greatly from most of the earlier reviewers. What I fear is that someone might be looking for a good technical book on legacy PCs. Gilster's book would NOT be a good choice!  I've spent most of the last eleven years traveling in third world countries, after leaving a long-term job running and maintaining a PC lab at a community college. I fear that someone working in these more remote places might want to buy this book as a technical introduction to legacy PCs, because such PCs are common in much of the world outside the U.S. and a few other industrialized countries. One can still find PC ATs and even XTs.  Having read the whole book, I feel the author has made a number of technical errors, used misleading and confused explanations for many technical subjects, glossed over numerous important nitty-gritty configuration topics, and dwelt much too often on unnecessarily detailed treatment of relatively trivial matters. For anyone new to PC technology (i.e., anyone without enough technical knowledge to be able to recognize the mistakes and misconceptions), this book would be a very poor choice.  For only about $6 more, you can buy the latest edition (currently 17th) of Scott Mueller's excellent book: Upgrading & Repairing PCs, which I highly recommend. For those interested in legacy systems, Mueller's book has always included a CD with earlier editions in PDF format. You can go as far back in PC history as you like.  Let the uninitiated be forewarned. There's probably a good reason why Wiley Publishing, Inc., has never issued a second edition of this book. I'm used to expecting better than this from Wiley. 
 Then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else?  The songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals, which arguably weren't that bad ("What a girl wants" and "Get this party started" were fairly tame to begin with).  Just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds 
 Let's start with being the nephew of Sigmund Freud.  Mr. Bernays witnessed the coming of the industrial revolution in full and his ideas were thus shaped believing that even men operate only as mindless automatons in the larger machinery of society.  The author believes that people are incapable of forming their own opinions due to the complexity of modern life.  Heck, these hickams from Topeka just came off the farm. Surely we in the elite must help them make their choices.  This is the tone of Propaganda.  Keep in mind that also during this time other similar misinformed ideologies were being incubated by Bernays contemporaries like Hitler and Stalin.  There is in truth much commonality between all three of these mens views.  All ideologies are dangerous and there seemed to have been a great number of squirrely ones developed at the beginning of the 20th century.  Bernays does have some karma to pay as this book was used by Hitler and the Third Reich as a kind of manual on how to deceive the masses.  And the Third Reich is not the last homeland to use Bernays ideas 
 The play goes along very similar lines as that of the shakespear play  measure for measure as both show selfabsorbtion is a paramount factor  though it does seem like a rewrite is does has its own high points  especially Mosca a very funny character 
 It is conventional wisdom that good books are written by good writers, and that understanding of the subject is of secondary importance.  This book is a disproof of that conventional wisdom.  Mr. Olson is a fine writer, but he is not a scientist.  Within the first 50 pages he has spent 2 pages on an incorrect explanation of an important genetic concept.   Give me instead the real McCoy: Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza is a scientist with true insight.  His book, "Genes, Peoples, and Languages" is beautifully inspired.  He truly understands what he is writing about; and the most interesting elements of Mr. Olson's book are better handled in (if not derived from) Dr. Cavalli-Sforza's book.  Mr. Olson, by contrast, is a layman who doesn't quite comprehend that about which he writes.  He is the blind leading the blind; and most of his readers don't know the difference, apparently including  the nominating committee for the National Book Award.  
 If you want to converse about argument, debate, shared insight, sophistry, truth, beauty, and the American way, etc., don't bother with this dreck. Just read any Platonic dialogue

 Like other reviewers, initially I was impressed with these very stylish and comfortable chairs. However, after 1 year outside (in Colorado) the rubber on the arms was all cracked and peeling, and the cords were frayed. The overall appearance was of a much older chair. Of course, it happened to be my mother-in-law who sat in one of the chairs when it gave way. A second chair's cord gave way shortly afterwards. 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage

 While the subject of this book is very interesting and deserves further study, the authors were very pretensious.  The book did offer some new insights into Thai economics and how the tourism and prostituion industries  interact, but one gets the feeling the authors wanted to rail against the  "Farangs" that travel to the kingdom.   Two items particularly  irritated me.  The first was how the authors referenced documents from a  navigator on Christopher Columbus' first voyage to America to describe how  foreigners feel about Thai prostitues.  How a document written about a  voyage before there was a Thailand (or U.S.A. for that matter) pertains to  Bangkok massage parlors, I'll never know.     The second  "documentation" concerned a Thai Air advertisement.  The ad  featured a stewardess smiling at a white airline traveler.  The authors try  to convince the reader that this is proof that Thai industries are actively  promoting the sex trade.  If this is true, nearly every commercial on  American television is an active promotion of prostitution in the U.S.      There is a need for a serious study of the socio-economic impact of the sex  trade in Thailand, but this is not it.  This is nothing more than a tirade  against prostitution and the foreign travelers who venture to Thailand.       How prostitution destroys young Thais is truly a sad story, but the  authors should devote a little more effort in researching their subject,  rather than blindly grasping at obtuse concepts to prove a predjudicial  viewpoint 
 This book was nothing like its advertisement.  I thought it was going to be a new take on the sleeping beauty fable, but it wasn't.  It took the fabled character Beauty and made her a sexual slave at the mercy of a medival sex ring. All the surrounding kingdoms sent beautiful princes and princesses to this castle as a tribute.  This young royals were subjected to horrific tortures and were treated worse than livestock. The characters who led this sex ring claimed it made these spoilt royals better people and better rulers when they were returned.   As I read this book, I figured there had to be a deeper meaning behind the ridiculous and unbelievable toture scenes, mind games, and Anne Rice's strange obsession with spanking.  No matter how demoralized Beauty became, she never tried to fight back or escape.  Just cried.  Apparently, this was her becoming a good slave. The characters were boring.  Probably because it must be difficult to properly develop character growth when you are so obsessed with spanking...  I tried very hard to finish it hoping for a reason for such an awful and tiresome tale.  There was no deeper meaning behind such a horrible story.  All there was at the end....was a sequel.  Um....not a chance.  I'm glad I didnt pay 14 bucks for this book, I read it in a bookstore for free. I am sorry enough for that. 
 This is certainly the worst of it. At least Lil Jon has good beats and stuff. This has none of that, and it is just annoying. Support better artists 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 I was very disppointed in the video performance of this product. I installed it on my new HP laptop with a 1.6 GHz Centrino Duo processor (which took a phone call to tech support and a download of new drivers) and found that there was a significant delay between what I was doing with the mouse and what I was watching on the screen. The resolution you're able to display on the external monitor is also limited, a fact which would have influenced my purchase. Without video capabilities that actually work, this product is a very expensive USB hub. I'm returning my docking station and using a USB hub. It only adds one more plug (instead of power and docking station I'm plugging in power, USB hub and VGA cable) and works infinitely better 
 This is a pleasant film to look at as far as the pretty girls and the colorful scenes.  However that's about all the good things I can say about it.  I can think of a lot better things that the pretty girls in this movie could have done besides getting their faces burned off, getting killed by a walking suit of armor, etc..  There's a diary involved but what exactly is in this diary I still have no idea.  Maybe I lost something with the English dubbing.  Once I lost the point about the diary there was no hope of understanding the plot.    There's some cocaine use involved somewhere but where that all fits in I don't know.  The ending is anticlimactic and really not possible from a logical point of view.  I don't want to ruin the 'suspense' by  telling what happens.  Based on reading the high praises of other reviewers I may not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie.  Give me "Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman" or "Brides Of Blood" any day over this movie.  Jeff Marzano  Recommended further viewing:  Horror Hotel IT !

 These authors, and this book (in an earlier edition) were the first wave of today's spam onlsaught.  If you need immigration information, please look elsewhere.  If you -really- want this book, please buy the used copy.  In the perusing of it that I've done, I found it to be not entirely uninformative, but I certainly wouldn't give it accolades, and, given it (and its authors') background, I wouldn't pay money for it if you held a gun to my head.

 There are a number of wonderful photographs included in this book, but I think that the author at times dares to presume dialogue and events which may be less than accurate than eye witnessed accounts. It's not quite trash, but then again, it is not quite THE biography of Mr. Kennedy 
 We have NOT received this item yet. Please let me know the current status 
 Sorry to say but this book is a dud.  While the concept of presenting interesting mathematical facts is great the presentation is so brief, so wrought with errors, and so incomplete that the work is not worth perusing.    Some of the "chapters" have answers at the back of the book and some do not.  It appears that the author could not make up her mind wether this was to be a "math tricks" book or a "popular mathematics" presentation substantiated by theory.    There are many other excellent books that are more fulfilling.  Journey Through Genius comes to mind.   All in all a disappointing work 
 I was born and raised in India on the wrong side of the caste system. I worked hard to become educated and to come to America. Perhaps in the 1960s, America was not as fair as it is now, but it was still better than anywhere else. I find books like this, where people whine about the amount of melanin in their skin, offensive. Angelou comments often about how much she hates white people. This is stupid and it shows how uneducated she still is.   If she had written this in the 1960s, in the throes of it, it might be interesting as a historical piece, but now it just shows how racist she it. I'll bet she hates Asians, too. Even when she was abandoned in Egypt by a man she wrongly called her "husband," (even though they weren't married,) she wouldn't go to the American embassy for help because white people worked there. Every slight in her life, she attributes to white people being racist because she is black.   This book is filled with name-dropping and smug anger.   Minn 
 I bought this as a gift for my 16 yr. old who enjoys the Foo Fighters, but regretted it when I saw even the 1st 10 minutes of the disk.  During the banter between songs, the F-word is repeatedly used.  This might be okay for older listeners, but in households with younger children, I wouldn't recommend it.  It was disappointing because the music itself is good 
 I've tried a several Catherine Coulter novels and all have the same theme: 1980's style bodice rippers where sex hurts (bloody, painful, rapist stuff), heroes are villainous cads, and heroines just take the abuse until they turn into abusers themselves.  This book is no different. There's the incestuous relationship of Marcus and Josephine being 1st cousins. Marcus acting like a complete cad flaunting his mistresses and showing absolutely no regard for anyone besides himself. Love scenes that are abusive, painful acts of rape. And of course no story that could possibly resemble a love story.  Why Coulter's books sell is beyond me. She writes like a masogynistic man insulting the feminine ideal of love. Her novels always make me feel sick 
 While the Sonic Foundry manuals have usually been sparse in details, this "instant" book comes with even less info.  If you need a book to hold your hand and explain things like: Custom Workspace... You can choose the toolbars you want to see.  Choose View.Toolbars (that's it), then this may be the book for you. But then the manual will tell you more than that.  For the Spectrum Analysis Tools there are just barely 100 words to cover the entire subject.  My copy is on the way back.  No more CMP Books for me

 A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.   In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?  Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books 
 Well in my opinion, there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies, and some people have had some unusual experiences (mostly disturbing, but some apparrently enlightening), but the question is, is it all as it seems?  The fact of the matter is, various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us.  Holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced, drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (Verichip).  I'm not saying that other lifeforms don't exist in the Universe (far from it), and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas, but this idea that there are little, menacing Greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense COLLUSION seems suspect.  It smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.  Historically, there's been the Barbarians, Huns, Mongols,  Pagans, Jews, Christians, Vikings, black Natives, Cannabals, red Natives, Mexicans, Germans, Nazis, Communists, now the Arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on Earth.  Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80's.  The fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked), they could quite easily pull the hoax off.  Even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and PRACTICED (albeit "underground") than most people can fathom.  What has become another fact is the major extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and compromised, of which Strieber has been front and centre at various times.  My belief is that Strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign, sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups.  In this book, his "hard-evidence" is flimsey and suspicious.  For example, why wouldn't super advanced Aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue (thus not showing up on any X-ray, MRI, CT, etc)?  And design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body?  Surely, this would be child's play for Alien scientists?  Why no major discussion or mention of the human military, or NAZI connection with abductions?  There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange "fragments" of memories that are slipping through various memory covers.  Why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the Greys?  Why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms?  Why are some speaking English, others German?  Why is there a connection with deep, underground bases and specifically Antartica?  These are things Strieber never mentions, which I find curious.  My point is, things are happening, but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what, and Strieber's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas.       
 This book is not recommendable.  Moore writes as a secular-humanist whose views have little to do with religion in America or Jesus.  He admits that he is not a religionist (pages 1-2).  One wonders if his S. Texas Presbyterian up-bringing ever took?    His reasoning is clouded by his deterministic agenda.  Often through the text he misses history's poignant lessons.  Moore's reading and presentation are questionable. (Examples: On page 18, Moore thinks George Whitefield to be "America's first religious entrepreneur".  What about Jonathan Edwards the New England pastor in America decades before Whitefield?  Page 86 promotes Southern Baptists to "America's largest Protestant denomination".  American Pentecostals, at least, would beg to differ.)  Additionally frustrating is Moore's complete lack of documentation (Is he attempting to revise history by not sourcing his reading of it?). Having no endnotes gives the book a feeling of impromptu chatter.  If you expect to find the origins of Moore's musings do not look to this book for answers.  One wonders if he quickly scribbled down the book after a dinner party discussion.  The best parts of this book are the title and the paperback cover.  GO IRISH!!   
 For Matchboxes, very difficult to find and reasearch based on a proprietary numbering system.  Numbering system not clearly articulated in overview.  I had to purchase a new "Matchbox specific" guide from another publisher.  
 this book is not easy to read. it reads like an encyclopedia, and a bad one at that. i could only bear a few hundred pages of it before i felt that i was wasting my time. only for the serious medical history student 
 I was about to order it online w/out even looking through it thinking that Sofia Coppola could do no wrong.  Well apparently she can because this book was highly disappointing.   Like the reviews below me have stated, it is simply the script and some low-quality photos on plain paper.   so glad I didn't purchase it 
 I don't believe it.  I'm sorry.  Any perceived reduction in pain can be caused by the placebo affect.  I highly doubt that someone who had bowed legs, all of a sudden had straight legs in five minutes.  The author is vague and the chapters lack documentation (Once, there was this lady who came to me...).  The author claims to be able to change the molecular structure of water by "running energy" into it.  Sorry, I might be closed minded, but there is no way.  The whole "quantum physics" thing is just a scientific explanation that, conveniently, no one can disprove, and the author uses this to his advantage to sell books, dvds, training sessions, etc.. 
 This book reads just like an infomercial sounds. Some of the information sounds credible and I have encountered it elsewhere, but some does not and NONE of it is substantiated in any way. By this I mean, he does not offer collateral resources for one to verify the data he put forth. Also some of his ideas & recommendations seems a little over the top to me. The book is VERY long but the essence of the contents could have been written in 100 to 125 pages. I was disappointed overall 
 I heard so many raves about this book, so I bought it for my 10 year old. The information to me was sparse, the printed words in the book are so tiny, I almost pulled out my magnifying glass for my child. The internet links, are links you can find on your own, by typing the subject in google. The price for this paperback book is riduculous.  Very disappointed, ended up buying the Kingfisher history book, which I found so much better in reading quality and price, especially since it is a hardback and the Usborne book I bought was a paperback. Check if they have it at the library or school to see if, it is what you want, before you waste your money 
 This series which presumptuously celebrates and brags about the sodomite lifestyle, feminism and the destruction of the nuclear, traditional family is one of the worst, most inexcusably heinous shows currently disgracing the TV landscape--although that isn't saying much since the ruinous, liberal ideology has for the longest time monopolized pop culture. This Desperate Housewives series is rebukable on several, equally critical fronts. The first and most infamous is by far its moral vileness;  the second is its horrid status as a mouthpiece for incriminatingly liberal "values"; the third is its low class cast of monotonous, expressionless actors; and the fourth is its either appallingly repetitive plot twists or its idiotically ludicrous tangents it goes off on when it needs to "freshen" its stale storyline.  At the first season's start, the viewer is mistreated to the basic concept: Mary Alice commits suicide, and this sets off the looming, boring storyline about the other four, remaining housewives "intellectually" attempting to solve her death for the rest of the season. At this point, the traditional and moderate American has already been subordinated to the liberal culture war where a family is left motherless with the death of Mary Alice. Liberals love to assault the traditional family with all their sick, "alternative" debaucheries, and the show endorses this through the removal of Mary Alice (mother) from her family, where we only have a dad/son left. Later on, the assault on the traditional family is worsened when the noble concept of adoption is attacked as the real mother of Mary Alice's son is revealed to have been killed by her adoptive parents, Mary Alice and Paul Young.  This show is nothing but a disguise of an assault on the traditional family. Other families include the divorcee (Teri Hatcher) whose husband is blamed for the infidelity that ruined their marriage; flagrantly, feminism is viciously alive on this show as hatred is directed to men. Another is the Van de Kamp family which egregiously loathes itself since the parents are trapped in an apparently loveless marriage, while one kid is a flaming, budding sodomite and the other is an uncontrollable villain. The next family involves the Felicity Huffman character whose troubles raising her purportedly ADD/hyperactive children derogates the concept of raising kids. The dislike towards the male gender is furthered as her husband comes home to be a demeaning, stay-at-home dad since his wife gets the bigger paycheck--an abnormality which rarely if ever happens in real life!!!! The last family is the most accursed as this depraved show celebrates pedophilia, through the Eva Longoria character preying on the high-school kid (John), and also infidelity while she rapes him.  By the rock-solid and sentencing examples above, it's clear that the incorrigible theme of Desperate Housewives is the single-minded and malevolent attack and belittlement of the traditional family. This cannot be defied; only if you're a moral relativist who practices PC can you excuse this mischievous show as something that merely serves as entertainment. The culprit for the mercilessly dissolute topics of unwholesomeness is the creator of the show, one Marc Cherry. Cherry is a shamelessly, openly gay sodomite, and his "alternative" (read: irreligious) lifestyle choices are egregiously what influence him to slant the show in such morally bankrupt misdirection.  Using basic common sense, we see Cherry's sodomite lifestyle influencing all the show's plot twists, as Cherry likely harbors much, personal resentment towards the traditional family, which likely but rightly shunned his choice of an unorthodox, sodomite lifestyle. When Cherry manufactures these scripts about Bree Van De Kamp's son being a closet homosexual who rebels, this blatantly is about Cherry's own, frustrated childhood. When Cherry writes about all the marriages breaking up, this is merely his thinly veiled bitterness at marriage being protected from sodomite unions recognized legally.  To boot, this show's acting by the four, enormously over-the-hill and washed-up fortysomethings is just unpardonable. Hatcher acts like the ditzy buffoon; Longoria is the slutty tramp; Cross is the pasty-skinned robot with no emotion; Sheridan desperately shows off her forty-plus body; and Huffman acts like the frumpy housewife. Their "performances" (read: monotonous impersonations of people) are repetitive and abnormally rehearsed.  In conclusion, Desperate Housewives is one of the worst, most irreparable shows to come out of un-American and liberal Hollywood in years. It--under the moral relativist-guise of entertainment--unaccountably celebrates profanity and misconduct to the extreme, and it attacks one of Judeo-Christian America's most revered institutions: the traditional family. The show is a ghastly train wreck which relies dependently on one crazy plot twist after another to keep the viewer lured because it cannot do so based on storyline, character development and interest alone. One severely suspects that it was created merely to scornfully give some bored, lonely housewives hypothetical situations which they will never find themselves in to alleviate their stay-at-home monotony. 
 My previous coffe pot, a cheapie Black-n-Decker, developed a habit of overflowing; because the cheezy "sneak a cup" mechanism would not function properly, creating the equivalent of a flooding toilet.  Well, I spent $$$ right here on Amazon to buy the Braun instead, and guess what? I now have an overpriced flooding coffee toilet.  I have owned this unit for around 6 months now, and on a given day, it will..  a.) produce the Flooding Coffee Toilet effect, with grounds and coffee everywhere (15% chance)  b.) Leak so much coffee during brewing that what started out as a full pot ends up as an 8-cup pot with the remainder on the counter (80% chance). Careful observation indicates this is due to a badly designed "sneak a cup" feature. The coffee creates a surface tension on the base of the basket, and trickles off to the edge of the coffee maker instead of dripping into the carafe.  c.) Deliver the expected pot of coffee (5% chance)  [note on option b.: I keep the coffee maker on a tray, because I got tired of cleaning up after it]  I will -not- buy another Braun. I should have boxed this unit up and returned it to Amazon the first week I had it. I kept saying to myself "It must be good, it was rated the best!"  Well guess what? I would rate it a ZERO STAR, but the least Amazon will let me give it is a 1 
 This guy took the simplest, barest points of The Richest Man in Babylon (albeit with proper homage... when an author says "pay yourself first" he's alluding to George S. Clason in 'Babylon') and blew them into a big book with a big marketing campaign and a big pile of baloney.  Much of the advice in the book, when Bach starts playing with numbers, winds up being contradictory.  The principles aren't bad (although they aren't his) but his specious, overblown examples wind up compromising the value of the whole message taken together.  About the only thing this book is good for is working children or teenagers with very limited imaginations, who can't connect to The Richest Man in Babylon or aren't capable of grasping its allegorical implications (like growing food in your own garden when you own your home... it's not entirely literal you see) or won't care for the more abstract or mature messages about personal honor and the responsibility of financial wisdom in challenging settings.  So this jerk sells a ton of truly mediocre books and looks like some kind of a superstar.  I don't like it.  If this and Who Moved My Cheese are where self-help books are headed, then I think a revival of Samuel Smiles, Orison Marden, and Napoleon Hill would be just around the corner.  At least, that's the hope 
 The World According to Waskow should be the title of the totally nonsensical, wretched collection of claptrap. Arthur "East River" Waskow should hold the title of "rabbit" and not "rabbi" because all he has done here is taken his personal political and pseudo-social agenda and coated it with a think shellac of Judaism. I took this book out of the library. I returned it. You should do the same 
 Do not buy this book if you want to learn anything meaningful or "real world" about game theory.  The author's examples are irrelevant and in some cases not applicable to game theory constructs.  
 The man died as he lived a loser. This uneducated thug was nothing more than a racist piece of crap. Plain and simple truth. The only praise he deserves is praise that he is dead. Thats one less racist thug off the streets. A two year old can write better music than he did. Heck calling his stuff music is an insult to music and musicians every wher 
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
 Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually HURTS to watch it. From the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters (odd, considering that in interviews after the first movie, all of them said they'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel), to the horrible (even by 1997 standards) CG effects, to the cliched fight scenes (gee...two women in a mud pit.  I bet it took them all night to come up with that one), virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie DID go wrong with this movie. Loosely based on the story of the Mortal Kombat 3 video game (and set immediately after the first movie, which, while not great, looks like Citizen Kane compared to this stinkburger), the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting Shao Khan (played by Brian Thompson, the alien bounty hunter from The X-Files) and his army (shown in most scenes as a small band of extras.  Oooh...scary.) as they attempt to take over Earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as Outworld.  This merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity. With only a week to do anything about it, Lord Raiden (played by James Remar, replacing the, and I can't believe I'm saying this, much better Christopher Lambert in the role) once again enlists the help of Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonia Blade (Sandra Hess), and Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), along with help from a select few other characters from the video games' crowded lineup, to prevent this from happening. The story in and of itself is not necessarily bad.  However, given the film's obviously low budget the weak screenplay, the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film, and most jarringly, direction even more inept than that of Paul W.S. Anderson, it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high, only to have practically everything come crashing down. The only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack, featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie, as well as music by KMFDM, Megadeth, Rammstein, Juno Reactor, and others. If ever you're looking to punish yourself for something, then by all means watch this movie.  However, if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself, you will avoid this movie like the plague.  Believe me, you'll thank yourself later. 
 This is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material.  The footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it.  The price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from I decided to return these sandals 
 The majority of my cases were damaged in shipping. I immediately threw away about eight, but as I tried to use the rest I gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well. Maybe I'm alone, given the other high ratings, but these seem more fragile than other slim cases I've used in the past. I'd give them 3-stars (because they're cheap) if they didn't have to be shipped.   
 ...Allow me to warn you:  these recordings have been idiotically overlain with phony crowd noise.  The ultimate sacrilege:  an arhythmic clap-along all the way through "Secret Agent Man"!!!  (Some of the clowns are on the beat, some a beat off; most follow a different drummer.)   Handling it with tongs, at arm's length, clothes pin clamped over my nose, I immediately took it down to Everyday Music, hoping either to sell it or bury it.     
 This book takes an interesting topic like functional programming and makes it hideously boring.  In retrospect, I wish I'd bought Hudak's book instead.  I read a review claiming that Mr. Thompson's book was better for newcomers to Haskell than Mr. Hudak's.  I don't know where this idea came from; I later borrowed Hudak's "Haskell School of Expression" and found it to be more informative and faster-paced than this book.  I give it two stars only because it is useful as a reference.  If you're looking to learn Haskell and do cool things with it, get School of Expression instead 
 This may be obvious by the title, but I'm going to say it anyway.  This book deals mostly with humans relationship with wolves, not the wolves themselves.  There is a lot of mystical and historical information about how humans have dealt with wolves.  The few chapters dealing with how wolves behave and live were well written, but far too short and did not contain enough information for me.  
 This was probably released to coincide with Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code movie as it discusses Dan's theories but also delves more into the Masonic aspects of the era which by default includes a discussion of the Knights Templar.  First of there are no golden secrets here. If you plan on buying the book to learn more about Solomonic - re: Goetia - you're only going to see a little discussion about it in Part Two Introduction's: The Elements of Spirit Evocation. This section is from pp. 122-139 and then you have pretty much the Goetia pulled verbatim and slapped directly onto pages 140-198. Thus if you alredy have a copy of the Goetia, then this book may only hold 17 pages of information that you're paying for.  In the previous 121 pages, DuQuette discusses the issues of Masonry and the charges of Occultism (satanism, Witchcraft, etc.) that have been unfairly levelled at it for several hundred years. He also offers a radical (but well thought out) theory about what the big secret was that the Templars held over the Church's head and why they were able to operate "outside the law".  Chapters nine & ten bored me to tears as they discussed "the Bible" and "the Crucifx". Nothing really amazing in here either and plenty you've heard elsewhere in your spiritual trek.  If you have a copy of DuQuette's earlier works such as _Illustrated Goetia of Aleister Crowley_ and his follow up work _My Life With The Spirits_, then you'll have more than enough material covered that he attempts to rehash in his 17 pages about the Goetia.  I give this book only 2 out of 5 stars for the fact he merely rehashed older material and has tried to make a profit on it from the release of the DaVinci Code 
 The flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did I know that I would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop.  When using the wet mop-it will leave water lines where I stop, therefore I have to wipe up the floor with paper towels. When using the vacuum my liquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks! I have not recommended this product to anyone. A waste of $100.00 
 Like the idea of getting some samples, but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles.   Do not buy. 
 i bought this unit and it was a piece of junk . It omitted way to much ozone which is the same as omitting smog in your house. That is what the smell is that comes from this unit. Please research ozone emitting air purifiers before you buy one. try google. When I tried to returned it a week after buying it Ionic Zone would not respond to my emails and I had to go through Amazon to get a refund. This unit is noisy and useless!! 
 This is a very good resource for a beginning beader!  Good pics, excellent directions, nice explanations.  However, for an experienced beader, it has nothing to offer and there is nothing "new" in it that isn't already in many other bead books.  It does not inspire 
 A Star Is Born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons.  By failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star's tragic downfall, the film displays a schizophrenic quality. There is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen.  This is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors; it's the nature of the material itself.  Perhaps if we were to see the James Mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living, the audience would understand what the Garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters.  Instead, we see Garland's character despairing over a not very likeable washed-up drunk and we're left feeling as empty as the film itself 
 There are at least two types of eloquence: one is stating the case in a manner that those already in agreement will applaud, and the other is arguing persuasively.   Kaminer's book has been hailed for its exhortations and wit by foes of the "self-help" movement, whatever that is exactly.   Fans of the books that she criticizes are undoubtably outraged.  The skeptical will be unimpressed.    The irony is, one of Kaminer's chief complaints about the somewhat ill-defined self-help movement is that it blunts our critical thinking: she wants a nation of critical thinkers who won't analyze this book too closely.  Kaminer doesn't offer any analytical evidence of how the self-help movement actually affects our society, she merely utters extremely vague warnings" "imagine the effect ... ."   Nor does she have much evidence as to how people typically use self-help: a reader might gain useful insights without letting the book rule their life or joining a cult around the author.  The "self-help movement" is a phrase that is tossed around a great deal, but what is Kaminer actually referring to?   Any book that lumps together Norman Vincent Peale, Wicca, Alcoholics Anonymous and M. Scott Peck is covering a lot of ground.  (It has never occurred to me to think of Wicca as a "self-help movement"; I guess Kaminer just doesn't like it and decided to throw it in for good measure.)  All of philosophy and theology could be thrown into such a broad categorization.  It would have been better if Kaminer had stuck to specific criticisms of specific books instead of trying to generalize about such a variety of works.  Kaminer's main arguments are two - one is that if you agree with her, the two of you will share the pleasure of sneering smugly at others.   Secondly, she keeps informing us that whatever it is doesn't appeal to her as if we should be just overwhelmed that ***!!!!Wendy Kaminer!!!!*** doesn't approve.  I actually read this a long time ago.  It came back to me when I was reading Paul Collins' fascinating Troubles with Tom: the Strange Afterlife and Times of Thomas Paine, and read the discussion of phrenology in the early 19th century.  Kaminer seems to assume that all this is a recent phenomenon, falling back, I suppose, on the common tendency to think that things are going to pot these days but were much better at some vague time in the past.  Actually, books of advice have been extremely popular since the the printing press made reading materials generally available: they were the best sellers of 16th century England.  Moreover, most of these books are based, legitimately or otherwise, on psychology and/or religion, both of which predate our time.   Kaminer has indicated a respect for psychology in other books, and religion certainly preceded the founding of the Republic that she argues is now endangered by self-help books.  So what has happened?  She compares, for example, a belief in the 12-step higher power with devotion to a political demagogue.  In the first place, a disembodied, individually conceived "higher power" is not capable of running for President-for-Life.   In the second place, how does this differ from religion in general (which Kaminer never directly deals with)?   Indeed, religious movements seem to me to be far more likely to be used for demagoguery: when was AA a voting bloc?  Some people do get pretty silly over these books, but is that because of the book, or because they're silly?  Are their individual lives actually better or worse without the book?   I know several people who work professionally with alcoholics who think that AA can be tremendously helpful.   Sure, it would be better if no-one was inclined towards alcoholism, but that isn't one of the choices.   The members of AA, et al., feel that they are better off with the program than without it.   Kaminer gives us no reason to believe that she is a better judge of what is good for them than they are.  Toward the end of her book, she expresses her hope that we will drop all this nonsense and learn to think sharply and insightfully.  She doesn't explain how she expects people who are too moronic to read these advice books critically are supposed to affect this transformation.   
 I really enjoyed Ms. London on the American Idol show, but this release is a real disappointment. The songs on this Cd do not give justice to her voice. I was surprised considering it was released on a Concord label.  Given the right material, Ms. London is great, but this release does not have it. There is too much hip hop r & b and not the serious stuff.I'm hoping the next release will be better.   
 If you're looking for real, useful information on starting a home inspection business, or becoming a better home inspector this book won't help you much. It doesn't take long before you realize the person writing this is not a home inspector. Mostly filler, with very little content. The "how to start your own business" tips can be applied to ANY business & are very basic. I got so frustrated with the lack of information I just stopped reading it 2/3 of the way thru 
 I clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for thinking that Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" is plain awful. This book was recommended to Harry Potter fans who have run out of HP books to read. I must say it was a waste of my time to read "Dark."  Never have I read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero. In this case, we are told that on his 11th birthday, an English boy named Will Stanton discovers he is the last of "The Old Ones." Unlike JK Rowling who, in the first pages of Harry Potter & the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's) Stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of Harry as skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes, and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Cooper does not describe Will Stanton at all. The result is that the reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what Will looks like!!  I also find quite annoying Cooper's approach to this good vs. evil tale. She is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are The Old Ones, and who or what exactly is The Dark. As for The Dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that The Dark means cold, snow, and--of course--darkness. Excuse me: but is this the best Cooper can do?  Is this what this book is about?--the Druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? What happened to the conception of evil as MORAL evil? 
 I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it 
 If you haven't met me before, I'm Skullface Mcfireball (sfmf for short). I have this book, and I wouldn't reccomend it. It shows how to draw Mario, Yoshi, Luigi, Toad, DK, and more. But no Bowser! Krog is the most silmilar to him, but I can't belive no Bowser! Who is Krog anyway? whatever, see ya peoples 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 K, besides the late arrival, the whole book was written in terminology in which I had to read over and over again before I understood the meaning. Its not like the book came with appendices right? Anyway, I do not know whats the huu haa about the book. It seems pretty fictional. Coming from a Muslim 
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 After 2 attempts at having this shipped to me, and both times having it arrive broken.  I have given up this model.  It's a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating.  If you can buy one at the store, it may be a great unit, but don't let it go UPS 
 The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

 My number one quality in a shaker is that it doesn't leak.  The OXO leaks and I am dissappointed in a brand that usually makes such good products.  I used it once and returned it 
 the so called 'secrets' that are mentioned in this book have not been secrets for decades. the majority of the book is a history lesson about the OTO.   Tyson does a much better job on inner planes lovers and his techniques work but are very dangerous. see my review on Donald Tyson and Sexual Alchemy.  if you are truly interested in secrets of western sex magic, i would look further afield than this book 
 This book purports to change our view of the revolution by exposing things that no one ever knew.  However in general in 95% of all American public schools students are today taught that Paul Revere didn't do his ride, that Washington was a brutal slave owner in it for money, and that Jefferson was a hypocrite.  Every American revolutionary is described as greedy and wrong in their cause, every ideal is either hypocrisy or not true.  In general the line of teaching and thinking today is that the American revolution and the basis of the constitution and American values is all evil and bad and based on ulterior motives.    This book is just continuing this anti-American theme of revising American history.  However this book pretends it is a lonely voice in the dark, but in general most of us already know what is being said her.  Most people are aware that the Native Americans joined the British side and were brutalized at wars end.  Most are aware that their were extremes and their was a racial aspect to the war and a class aspect and that it degenerated into a civil war so much so that Ben Franklins son joined the English.  Who is not aware of these things.  There is little new information here, accept perhaps a little bit more time spent explaining how perhaps it would have been better had American continued to be occupied by the British government and imperial Britain continued to tax Americans without representation and continue to force the church of England down every American throat and discriminate against Jews and other minorities.  American revolutionaries had many qualities to be admired, in some ways they were more progressive then politics today, their ideals were more utopian then ours, in the end American revolutionaries were people to be admired not spit upon the way this book does.

 The best thing I can say about the test is it took 13 days to receive my results.  The actual results varied greatly from those I received from my doctor 3 months prior:  (...)  Both tests were taken following a 12-hour fast.  All instructions were followed.  I find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in 3 months.  I contacted BioSafe customer service.   All representatives were busy on my first call so I left a message, which was not returned.  I called again and was able to speak to someone right away.  The customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods (finger prick vs. blood drawn from arm) will vary "slightly".   (...)  I question the accuracy of the biosafe results.      
 andy milonakis makes me sick to my stomach i hate his show it is the STUPIDEST s*** ever. The show so horrible after watching some of it leaves me with a even more dislike for this weird *** adult acting and trying to entertain teenagers. Andy's show sucks and instead of wasting time with this **** be better off buying a copy of the Tom Green show. i wish i could give it no stars and my grandma did not get me this *** 
 This tractor is advertised as a great back yard toy but is geared to high for younger children.  My son, who is almost 4 is a very stong bicycle pedaler but he can not make this tractor move across the lawn.  It would be great if you have a lot a pavement to ride it on, but if you planning on them ridding it through the back yard, forget it.  This is an on pavement toy only 
 The best way of persuading people to accept misinformation is to mix it with some credible information. And so Dore Gold demonstrates with this anti-U.N. screed.   Not an adamant fan of the U.N. myself, I began my reading already familiar with organization's questionable track record, replete with institutional corruption and bureaucratic ineptitude. This book, I hoped, might use the ample failures of the U.N. to issue a fair indictment and perhaps show the way to a more accountable and responsible international body.   What I got instead was propaganda from a former Israeli ambassador with an extremely large political axe to grind. Instead of allowing his conclusions to be dictated by the facts, Gold seems bent on ramming a pre-packaged conclusion down readers' throats -- that the U.N. "fans the flames of chaos" and "supports terrorism and terrorists" -- by selectively cherry-picking anecdotal cases, removing them from their political context, and hoping that most readers know so little about his examples that they will leap blindly from his shaky evidence to his conclusion.    Moreover, his decision to use the hashest possible language in accusing the U.N. of abetting terrorism and spreading chaos seems to reveal a personal hostility to the U.N.  This is, of course, speculation.  But what is not speculation is that the quality of his argument is lacking, perhaps due to the fact that it issues from a visceral reaction rather than a rational analysis.  As already stated, his thesis itself is questionable.  Rather than to accuse the U.N. of worthlessly neglecting to handle international crises in an adequate manner, Gold is adamant that the U.N. actually goes beyond that and *contributes* to the crises, chaos, and terrorism.  As a later reviewer notes, Gold specifically states, "**By not adequately dealing with** the conflict in Bosnia, the UN fueled the Balkan crisis, which eventually spilled over into Kosovo and Macedonia. The failures in Rwanda fueled a massive central African war in which five nations invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where approximately 2.5 million people died in the next four years. And as Iraq flagrantly violated UN resolutions on [WMDs], Libya, Iran, and North Korea ignored the UN's international control system on nuclear weapons [p. 224]" (asterics added).  But this claim is not analagous to "fanning the flames of chaos," which implies contributing to a condition through one's actions, rather than one's inactions.  It is more appropriate to say that the U.N., by "not adquately dealing" with these situations, is simply neglecting to stamp out the fire. Yet Gold is content to let his highly inflammatory accusations stand, as though the U.N. were helping Iraq to hide its weapons programs or were passing out machetes to the Rwandan Hutus.   If his thesis were merely that the U.N. fails to stamp out the flames of chaos, he would receive little serious argument.  He would, however, have to account for his analysis of why the U.N. is ineffective.  Gold's explanation of why the U.N is ineffective is that anti-democratic nations have come to dominate the body as its membership has expanded over the past half-century.  However this theory does not square with the examples he cites to prove the U.N.'s impotence.  For example, he mentions the failure of the U.N. to mobilize peacekeepers in Rwanda in 1994, and the utter impotence of U.N. "observers" who did nothing to stop the slaughter of Bosnian teenagers at Srebrenica in 1995.  Gold is correct that the U.N. was quite ineffective in both situations, but he does not give the true reason why:  the U.N. was acting within the constraints laid down by the Western states that Gold claims are so powerless and outnumbered in today's U.N..  In the case of Rwanda, the United States refused to acknowledge that genocide was even taking place.  In the case of Srebrenica, the UN "peacekeepers" sat idlely by because the Security Council -- dominated by Western nations (the "perm five") -- permitted the use force only to protect the humanitarian convoys whose presence the West was using as an excuse not to intervene militarily.  In both cases, assigning blame to the U.N., while only occasionally and sporadically hinting at the policies of individual Western nations, paints a highly inaccurate picture of the U.N.'s failures.  In these two cases, the inaction of the U.N. at mobilizing blue helmets reflected the wishes of wealthy Western states of the Security Council, not the Pakistans or the Irans of the U.N. General Assembly.  In other words, the West was handicapping the U.N., not the other way around as Gold tries to convince his readers with selective interpretations of history.  How ironic that in making his case against the U.N., Gold mentions historical examples that disconfirm his own thesis, and show why the U.N. has truly come close to irrelevance.  Gold also expends a great deal of intellectual effort into implicating the UN by association. Because officials of the U.N. like Kofi Annon have routinely met with leaders like Mugabe or Castro, readers are to believe that the U.N. is responsible for granting legitimacy to them and, thus propping up their "terroristic" and despotic regimes. Though interacting with leaders does grant them legitimacy, sometimes it is the only viable option.  Western leaders routinely meet with the heads of authoritarian regimes in the interests of peace and stability. What is worse, they often do so for sheer personal political or economic gain.  Gold is strangely silent on the fact that Rumsfeld was shaking hands with the Butcher of Baghdad as he was gassing Kurdish villages with chemical we sold him.  He also neglects to mention that Arch-conservative Richard Nixon visited Mao Tse Dong in 1972. Japan and South Korea, long-time American allies, conduct talks with Kim Jong-Il, charter member of the axis of evil, not because they support his regime, but because they understand that ignoring it is not a realistic option. One wonders why Dore Gold would be annoyed at the UN's disproportionate fixation with Israel's behavior, when he disproportionately criticizes UN diplomats for meeting the very same disreputable figures that Western nations have talked to for years.   This critique ultimately falters because it presupposes a balance of power in the U.N. that does not correspond to the body's structure.  The United Nations is a Western contrivance, depending on and thus controlled by Western regimes.  Nothing can get done without the unanimous approval of the U.K., France, the U.S.A, and Russia (as Gold very well knows, having watched in person many U.S. vetoes of Security Council resolutions condemning Israel).  Gold's constant allusions to obscure details regarding the U.N.'s minimal and loose associations with terrorist groups and authoritarian governments misses this big picture -- the bigger picture which is capable of producing the truly important lessons.  About the only thing that one can take away from this book is that Gold hates the U.N.  One easily realizes this from reading the title of the book, however, and need not even pay twenty dollars.  Of course the U.N. is not the panacea for all of the world's political ills, but this book does not even come within shouting distance of the many, far more complex reasons why. 
 this toy is only good for decoration.  it collapses very easily and its parts, some of them small and necessary, are quickly misplaced.  
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 Didn't like this book-- honestly i prefer to hear alan lecture, so far none of his books have had the impact that him speaking has for me 
 Williamson seemed to be coasting--just slapping this story together  without really putting any serious effort into it. The hackneyed plot was a rehash of the elements of many plots in books I have read over the last 50 years--nothing new or exciting.  The characters were never really developed to the point that I cared about what happened to them. Definitely not a page turner 
 This book might be a lot more helpful if it were updated regularly. The current--third--edition is from 1986, which is ludicrous with subject matter this volatile. The content itself is a bit too brief, but would still be very helpful if it had been done some time in the last 1-5 years 
 Basically, I think they sold out on this soundtrack. Alot of the songs that are prominently featured throughout the movie are missing (for example, Sum 41's Makes No Difference, Mest's What's The Dillio, Bis' Detour (Do You Wanna Go My Way?)) and instead, we find alot of songs of which we simply hear clips of during the competition mixes. Now, if they had actually featured the mixes in their entirety, it would be different. But instead we are left with a bunch of, quite honestly, mediocre songs 
 This movie may look interesting, but it is incoherent and trivial. Not really worth watching 
 I clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for thinking that Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" is plain awful. This book was recommended to Harry Potter fans who have run out of HP books to read. I must say it was a waste of my time to read "Dark."  Never have I read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero. In this case, we are told that on his 11th birthday, an English boy named Will Stanton discovers he is the last of "The Old Ones." Unlike JK Rowling who, in the first pages of Harry Potter & the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's) Stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of Harry as skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes, and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Cooper does not describe Will Stanton at all. The result is that the reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what Will looks like!!  I also find quite annoying Cooper's approach to this good vs. evil tale. She is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are The Old Ones, and who or what exactly is The Dark. As for The Dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that The Dark means cold, snow, and--of course--darkness. Excuse me: but is this the best Cooper can do?  Is this what this book is about?--the Druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? What happened to the conception of evil as MORAL evil? 
 I found this book very entertaining and interesting to read. Watts surely excels at presenting his work to as to make it appealing to large non-technical audiences. However, I happen to have a technical background, and while I cannot comment on the sociological value of the results of this new "science of networks," it seems fairly clear that there are no hard results of any significance in this work.  Watts claims to be a mathematician, but all he seems to have done is to construct some simple mathematical models and run computer simulations on these. What's wrong with that, you ask? Well, that is just... how should I put it delicately.. trivial work. No mathematics department would let him get away with a PhD for this... which doesn't really mean anything in and of itself, but this was all the book, written by a self-proclaimed mathematician, has in terms of hard facts or rigorous results. There's a lot of discussion and speculation and interpretation, which is all very interesting, but very little scientifically rigorous original work of any value.   I noticed some other reviewers saying that this is not an easy read, but is worth the effort. I'm not being the least bit snobbish or arrogant about this, but I found the book fairly easy to read (as would anyone with some knowledge of mathematics), and wouldn't advise any laypeople to waste their time. Don't bother following Watts' intellectual travels as a researcher; it may not be easy to read, but there's not much there anyway.  I haven't said much about the actual content about the book, so here goes. Watts identifies the small world phenomenon, aka I can reach the president of the US through at most six steps, as occurring surprising frequently in the world around us. He sets out to understand the why and how of such a phenomenon. Now this is a rather hard problem to answer in a mathematical framework, because such real world networks are very difficult to model.   Watts and his PhD advisor evidently realized this, but went ahead and constructed some very simple models of such networks, and tried to analyze these models. So far so good. But even these simple models proved too hard to analyze mathematically, so they had to resort to running computer simulations, and explain the results in qualitative, rather than quantitative, terms. They made some interesting observations, but frankly, this ain't no work of genius, or anything close. Running simulations when one can't analyze a mathematical model is something all too many graduate students in various engineering disciplines do on a regular basis, but most of them don't have the gift of writing and finding the right audience that Watts does.   In my opinion, these toy models and simulations have nothing deep to say about anything in the real world. Further, in my opinion, this so called new science of networks, which seems to be attracting a fair bit of attention, will have absolutely nothing useful to contribute to any real world problems. In the words of Dennis Miller, that's just my opinion, and of course I could be wrong. But stay tuned, and we'll see 
 I had previously purchased an HWU54D and love it ! This model never functioned properly and the software could not be completely removed from one of my desktops.  I will not purchase this model again 
 I was so anxious to receive this book and read it, just my cup of tea!  A reanimated corpse in love with a rat-queen who can't get enough bedtime favors, who leave a trail of destruction in their wake.  Wow.  Now the reality check.  What sounds like a spectacular idea and a great story is utterly ruined by a first person POV that is so randomly and haphazardly told that it is not only hard to follow but unfathomably boring.  There seems to be not a fragment of straightforwardness in Calder's prose, though he also misses out on the poetry of surrealism.  Only 190 pages, it still took me a couple of weeks to labor through Frenzetta, and for all that I was still left un-rewarded with any type of conclusion satisfactory enough to warrant the time I spend tediously wading through paragraphs of random images to find one small sentence that moved the fragmented storyline further towards its finish.   This is not lyricism; it's more like listening to someone with schizophrenia or dementia describe a dream to you, that someone else had.  Whew.  Save your money and pick up Edward Lee if you want gross, or China Mieville if you want lyricism. 
 With this volume Bryan Ward-Perkins seeks to dispel the myth that the end of the Roman Empire and the subsequent rise to prominence in Western Europe of the Barbarians was a relatively peaceful transition, without a large level of violence, or even major disruption. In this area he is successful, however this does not change my opinion that this is, overall, a weak book.  Ward-Perkins begins by discussing how recent works discussing the Fall of Rome and the Rise of the Barbarian West have dispelled the notion that this transformation was violent, or largely disruptive. IMO this is one of his weakest arguments. I have read dozens of books discussing this era and in none of these have I seen anything to support his claim that this is the current trend in the field. All works I have read speak of death, enslavement, destruction, the sack of cities, the displacement of thousands of people, etc. These works have taken differing views on whether this was a good or bad thing, or whether it was necessary, or, above all, just what it was that caused the end of the Western Empire, but in none of these have I read an argument put forward that the period was relatively painless. One text which he specifically takes exception to is Peter Brown's "The World of Late Antiquity" (1971). While I have not read this, I do have Brown's "The Rise of Western Christendom" (1996). In it, I do not see an argument for a peaceful transformation. While one may argue over his characterization of conflicts as being generally small and localized rather than large-scale in nature, Brown refers to the "end of Roman Peace" p 56 and the "grim glimpse of the human cost" p 78.  In addition, Ward-Perkins is given to over-exaggeration. Nowhere is this more evident than in his assertion that the Post-Roman West had fallen to a level of economic prosperity "back to a standard of living typical of prehistoric times." p 183 or that "It took centuries for people in the former empire to reacquire the skills and the regional networks that would take them back to these pre-Roman levels of sophistication." p 137  I certainly have no argument with anyone who says that overall standards of living, levels of trade, cultural sophistication and complexity, etc., fell and fell radically following the end of the Roman Empire in the West. But to argue that these fell to below pre-Roman levels over anything close to the entire region is beyond belief, particularly when these assertions are not supported. Ward-Perkins appears to ignore the Visigothic taxation system established by Euric in Spain and Southern Gaul immediately following its seccession from the Empire, or that evidence exists for a vigorous (if less extensive) maritime trade continuing throughout the Mediterranean. He himself states that "Once the violence was over, in large parts of the former western empire a great deal of the social structure, and much of the administrative and cultural framework of imperial times, re-emerged and flourished." p 63 I do not see how this statement can be reconciled with an argument for society to have fallen below pre-Roman standards. Certainly this may be argued for small areas, or for brief periods of time, and I would hesitate even to argue against him for the whole of Britain. But overall, this outlook is insupportable.  I will not say that this book is without worth. For much of it, I found myself agreeing with Ward-Perkins, only to revert back to the thought, "Who is arguing anything else?" In particular, his discussion of pottery and what archaeological evidence can reveal is very instructive. To his credit, Ward-Perkins admits to being "conditioned by a very 'Roman' upbringing and early experience" p 169. I believe that while much of what he says is supportable, much is overblown. If there are works extant that argue for a relatively pain-free ending to the Roman Empire (rather than simply utilizing terminology which Ward-Perkins disagrees with), these are certainly misrepresentations of the evidence, however this is no reason to provide a work which misrepresents matters in the opposite direction.  Ultimately, this reads more as a 200-page editorial than a scholarly historical work. I would not argue against someone purchasing it, but if you do, please purchase other companion volume or volumes covering the same period to help provide a more balanced view 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 A lame group of angry teenagers screaming about themselves. Ironic lyrics like "Image of the Invisible" do not make them intellectual. This trash is not music. Get it off my radio! If only I could give 0 stars.. 
 A good tech book has no fluff or filler, makes it easy to see and reference the major points and principles, and has solid unambiguous examples.  This book disappoints on all three counts.  This book has a lot of padding: it spends a lot of time repeating what it already said or prefacing what it will say next, or using an entire paragraph to say what a single clear sentence would.  The principles and major points are then buried in that muck instead of being clearly stated and highlighted.  On the bright side, chapter 7 (Query Language) had plenty of nice examples 
 I bought this book because I thought I'd relate with the author's choice of the title "The Best Little Boy in the World".  It took me less than fifty pages to realize that this was one of the worst books I've ever read.  I can imagine that this book probably made a lot of difference when it was written, but today, I like to think we've progressed beyond the self-loathing, hatred of our own nature, and belittling of anyone that isn't like us to make this book less relevant for today.  If I was recommending a book to a teenager to help them with their coming out process, I definitely would not recommend this book.  I mean, come on, coming out is traumatic enough as it is, why would I want to make it worse by suggesting they read a book that will only put them down and make them feel worse about themselves?    
 Karen was a girl who had been to no exotic places so when her so-called "cousin" Blanch nvites her to England saying her dad gave permission, Karen is extremely happy. The story is sizzling and exciting,  the plot is unique, the escape is strategically planned.  I was kept in  suspense till the last page 
 Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre 
 This is a shorter, much simplified version of the original story that was published by Pantheon books in 1983.  I'm not sure what the point was in making a simplified version, since the complete story of Cornelius was my son's favorite when he was 3 years old.  I'd skip this version and go with the original 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 The topic is too abstract for my level. SQ is hard to measure. People with a strong religious background might find this book more informative. I prefer concrete theories 
 I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.  A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 I'm an avid reader of business and marketing books, but I found this turgid. I've actually given up. I can tell there are some interesting thoughts in there, but my eyes just glaze over. Could be just me 
 I got this book because when faced with a new situation or task my first response is often "I can't do that." I was looking for somthing to help me know that I CAN (because I can).  So far, this book isn't it. I'm only halfway through and probably won't finish, because I'm not finding what I need here.  If I needed to know about different kinds of guilt, or about love, or if I needed to know about the "sexist attitude of society" that has "placed labels on women which must be overcome if a woman is to be treated as a person and not a sex object", or "If a young woman has poor self-esteen, she will often marry the first man who comes along" this book would be great. But as far as helping me to be a more confident person, not great 
 didnt like this album much. holiday was really good, but the rest of this album annoyed me 
 I ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest.  Tipler's theory of immortality, in a nutshell, is the following: 1) the planet earth...and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in ~1 billion years. 2) Man will make self-learning and self-replicating machines (can Windows XP do that?) that will colonize, over millions of years, our galaxay and, eventually, the entire universe. 3) These machines will be capable of individual thoughts, emotions, etc and are essentially "alive." 4) As the universe begins to collapse, the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe. 5) All the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one "super being" at the center of the collapsing universe...this super being is the "omega point." 6) The omega point, via its "all knowledge of all things" will be able make emulations (exact duplicates) of all biospheres, including earth.  Within these emulations, individual humans (you and me!) will be emulated.  Thus we will again be "alive" as these "beings" in these emulations will be unable to tell if they're real or virtual....PRESTO...immortality for all.  The book (theory) reeks of circular logic and assumptions.  It's an interesting theory, but it's just that, an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist.  PS: Tipler denies the resurection of Christ and in  the last chapter admits to being an aetheist.  (I wonder if he's a God-fearing aetheist? 
 I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
 This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it's built the same way.  I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use.  It didn't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off.  When I called for warrantey information, I had waited too long, it is only guaranteed for 90 days.  I'd give it negative stars, but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up 
 Why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? After the wonderful Quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for Nora Roberts to write Seth's story. After all we journeyed with Seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. Nora Roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. But us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. And we got Chesapeake Blue. Reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted Seth's story but....this wasn't what I (and my fellow NR fans friends) wanted. First of all I wanted the heroine to be Aubrey. After their beautiful friendship in the Quinn trilogy I expected her to be Seth's love interest. But I tried to keep an open mind after all I loved Anna, Grace, and Sybill, but Dru Whitcomb Banks was a completely let down. All she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what Cam, Ethan, Philip, and Seth experienced as children. Seth becoming an artist was a surprise too I expected him to join the family business and design boats. The Gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. There's no reason Gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that Seth wouldn't tell his family considering the Quinn Brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. I closed this book vowing never to request, beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. Because this is what you get 
 I bought this book expecting to immerse myself in an epic struggle of Good vs. Evil.  I got a facile tale of the Southwest.  Buyers beware!  This is not the Miltonian epic, but rather a wolf in sheep's clothing 
 ... I found this version of Alice almost unwatchable. Previous reviews well capture this version's character, including its truly fatal flaws. Please read them. But I think they are by-and-large far too charitable. I love Carroll's works, so do not take this negative review as a knock on the Alice books; it is purely about this dismal and moribund adaptation.  Note, I write "adaptation." This is not a faithful version of Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," nor was meant to be. Fair enough. But wherever there was any mirth or joy in Carroll's book (which is itself slightly dark), producer/director Miller has replaced it with a cringe-worthy combination of sleep-inducing sonambulism on Alice's part, and obscure and pretentious dated social commentary on the part of other characters. It simply doesn't work in America in 2007, and I doubt it worked even in England in 1966.  There *are* bright spots, to be sure, as others have mentioned: Sir Michael Redgrave's Caterpillar, Peter Cook's Hatter, and--for me the best and only not-depressing part of the film--Sir John Gielgud's Mock Turtle. But these cannot make up for what is otherwise a perhaps noble effort, but simply no fun.  As jammer wrote, "The director never seems to get enough of having interminable full-face close-ups of [Alice], whose visage is devoid of expression or reaction and during which, little if anything else happens to advance the rest of the story. (Meanwhile all this precious screen time goes down the tubes when it could have been used so profitably elsewhere! Aarrgggghhhh!) Lewis Carroll, whose whole focus revolved around Alice, must surely have turned over in his grave."  Just so, and, as Alice says, "At any rate, I'll never go *there* again!"  (Note: my nearly three year old daughter is entirely in love with KCRW's radio/CD version of Alice [available for purchase only at kcrw.org, I think], and listens to it over and over. She is surely not the target audience of this disturbing version, but I thought she'd at least want to watch it *once*. She couldn't even make it through a single viewing. It's simply "too dark--too dark altogether." 
 If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
 There was only one character worth liking in the book and she basically got screwed over.  There were just too many characters with no redeeming qualities.  I finished the book but it left a very bad taste in my mouth 
 In spite of the promises on the back cover, flyleaf, and publisher, this book consists of nothing more than the story of one corporate espionage case, and a decidedly low-tech one at that.  Sprinkled between chapters filled with excruciatingly repetitive and frankly boring details of the Avery espionage case, are several mildly interesting profiles of so-called corporate spooks, whose techniques range from "oh, I can do all kinds of stuff, but it's so secret I can't tell you" to "I go to trade shows and ask people questions" Reading the book, one gets the impression that the author may indeed have heard all kinds of cool stuff during his research, but none of it found its way into the pages of this book. This would've made a killer magazine article, but the book's just not there 
 I was truly not happy with this book.  All I know of the Kovels what I've seen of them on TV.  This is the first book I picked up authored by the pair and it will probably be the last.  The last twelve marks I have tried to identify have not been in this book.  Though I find the chapter layout of the book helpful, what is missing is content 
 About theory, the book is good, but; it needs more practical or numerical examples, in order to get the information understandable. There are too many concepts and ideas that without a good example, it is very hard to assimilate. Also the computer oriented experiments in matlab, do not use the neural network tool box, so it is not possible to get the gap to convert knowledge into computer code. If these two recommendations are improved in a next edition, the book will become and excellent one.  thanks 
 This is what happens when great authors go to seed. It seems like a cruel mockery of a Greene novel, parading the same old themes around, corrupted more than ever by an unjustified excess liberalism. There isn't a single living character here, and even though the prose is generally competent, I think it has to be buried in consideration of the man's memory 
 Overall, it's disappointing. The book merely scratches the surface on a wide range of topics and therefore is only slightly useful for someone who already knows what processes are or can build a kernel. Still haven't found a replacement for O'reilly's Understanding the Linux Kernel, which has detailed coverage of such topics as processes, scheduling, and memory management. 
 I live in Atlanta, and maybe my water is better than I thought (!?!), but I didn't notice any difference at all. The shower head is pretty flexible, but my shower stall is small, so the shower head wasn't adjustable enough for the water to flow at enough of a downward angle, so the water hit me at neck level, which was REALLY annoying! Disappointed, I returned it. Installation was easy, and I didn't have a problem running hot water through it. 
 I bought this cd for one of my friends, and honestly it just isn't my style. If you like sappy love songs, about break ups, and you like whiney voices, then this is perfect for you 
 Sometimes one sees a book and struck by simply the title itself makes an impulse purchase.  As a "Westerner" living in the East, I purchased this book thinking it would provide more insight into the phenomenal Christian activity and growth that I see regularly here in the East.  The title, I would soon discover, is not the most accurate description of what the book entails.    The book's primary interest seems to lay in a discussion of the vernacular translation of the Bible, and even that is focused especially on the African continent.  The non-western movement of Christianity is much broader than Africa, yet this is mentioned only as a side note in this work.    The format of the work certainly is a love/hate item for myself.  Largely presented in a question and answer format ('interview format') that ranges from comical to frustrating to at times interesting.  I have found this kind of format, before as with this text, helpful at first but soon quite tedious as it plods on and on page after page.  When the author is not giving incredibly leading questions, his questions present the biased extreme of the 'enlightened' view.  These criticisms aside, the book did present some great insights.  I appreciated the response to questions on judging an individual's response to the Gospel and conversion.  Also appreciated is the presentation of the strength in the 'Designer's hand' of including all cultures and languages in His ultimate saving Gospel.  A person involved in Scripture translation would also find great encouragement in the author's high praise and respect for translation to the 'mother tongue.'  A cumbersome presentation (Q&A format), misleading title and bit wordy discussion of  the main topic (translation of the Bible into the 'mother tongue') cause me to give this book only 2 out of 5 stars 
 The book did start off on a good note, but it seems to lose track of scientific temper of research. Research is a structured investigation. Data sources seem inadequete & substantial bits are missing. Like author's first hand experience. This makes it look like a coverup for a frustrated minority 
 I love my other silcone spatula's by Mario but this one is not what I expected.  The edge warps, and it is very difficult to get it under a pancake for example and turn it over.  It literally was sticking and tearing the pancake and I was using a non stick griddle.  I think perhaps it needed to be a little less long so there would be more support for the food item. Not sure what the warping problem is cause I have only used it once...to try and turn the pancake and washed by hand.  I tried putting a weight on the leading edge and leaving it weighed down several days but when I checked to see if that fixed it...it was still warped 
 I agree with the other reviews that the Rival coffee cup warmer barely warms the cup, much less the contents. The Dazey has 25 watts, and that makes a big difference. The Dazey Corporation apparently still exists, but I cannot find a website. Rival oughta get hip and beef up the wattage 
 you no i thought he didnt need cash money or the hotboys till i heard this album bg my favorite anyway this album sucks if will ripe your guts out and feed them to you it was so bad i went into a depression cause i like the hot boys if they were still together gunit would be in alot of trouble and everbody else in the rap game 
 If this is a horror novel, then I may be also a candidate to be the new Stephen King because I have better stories under my belt than this drivel.  What starts great with chills of isolation from civilization and convincing youngster jealousies and contests turn into mediocre with werewolves, underground tunnels, City Inferno like scenes right down to terrible with fantasy-like drivels, gods and rituals....There are something like a storyline but you can never be sure and characters are jokes, shifting constantly from pure evil to pure good to pure couregous to full traitor. Horror factor drops below zero and freezes there.  Simply skip...I wish someone in Leisure Books had read this drivel before publishing it.   Now do I have to still a new Stephen King book to read a good horror story? No of course. But new authors do not show any promise, sorry 
 There are times when this book goes off on a tangen. Sometimes I actually forgot that the book was about fressmasonry because it rambles on about things in way too much insignificant detail.  Also, some of the investigation into the historical aspect of the reasearch unjustly discredits the many things that have already been proven by scholars and archeologist. Overall, I think the authors came to their conclusions about history because they found what they wanted to find and made sense out of things that was most convenient for them. It is sort of like looking for a cloud in the shape of an animal...if you look hard enough you will find it. I was not as dissapointed when I learned that neither of these authors has a background in history, research, or the arts. One is in advertisement while the other is an engineer ?????? My recommendation is to look for publications written by those in their respective fields 
 I had never heard of Wilbur Smith, but he was recommended to me by friends in South Africa. At the airport I looked for one of his books and found many. All about 1000 pages long with embossed covers signaling bodice rippers. With a ten hour flight ahead, I thought, what the heck, give it a try.   The first impression proved accurate. What a silly, inconceivable story which can never seem to find a focal point. The three Courtney heros are gods on earth. They speak in a matter of months whatever language they come in contact with (including Arabic and obscure African dialects), they are amazing fighters who succeed in shaking off injuries more rapidly than a professional wrestler, they have an aura of command, even at age 10 or 17 that shames the most seasoned captains, they are great lovers (of course) etc. Good Lord! What two dimensional, predictable characters. And what a complicated, never-ending collection of ridiculous epic romances.   I will leave Wilbur Smith in the future to my South African friends (he is, after all, a South African, though he now lives, I understand, on the Isle of Maurice)and to the airport book stores.  Out of curiosity, I scanned the 91 reader reviews found on the Amazon site. Only 4 of the 91 seem to share my low opinion of this lightweight attempt at a good adventure story. Which confirms that Mr. Smith knows how to write for his public. And can afford exile from his native land. Which he richly deserves! 
 Myers' earlier books were palatable, but this one pales badly.  Magdalena has become not only cutesy but (gag) politically correct.  I couldn't get past the fourth page.   Myers comes off as a Diane Mott Davidson wannabe, and falls considerably short 
 I've been a fan of Heinlein's SF for just about as long as I've been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.  The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.  For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of "fascism" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.  And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.)  Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. "The Pragmatics of Patriotism", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen.  Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.  Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. Asimov's reputation as the "great explainer" is in no danger here.  This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.  And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer 
 I was at the library, wondering if rabbits made good pets, and I picked up this book. It was right beside dog training books, books about cats, etc. But, unfortunately, as I found out when I got home, this book is about raising rabbits to sell for meat. The last chapter is horrific- after going into detail about how to raise these beautiful creatures, the author goes about telling the reader how to destroy it, and which spices taste nice on its skin. No thanks. I just want a Mopsy 
 I've had very bad experience with this vacuum. It is bulky, heavy, and inconvenient. Also, the cord is too short if used in a big house. Carrying it up and down stairs -- forget about it! After all these trouble the engine got fried. Then, the interesting part started. I contacted Sanyo for warranty work. They referred me to some service center, which was out of business. After going back and forth they accepted their mistake and pointed me to some other place which is very far from me and I am in Chicago area! So, there is 1 Service center to serve 12 million people. Don't buy it! Horrible product, plus no service 
 We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years.  With a new baby on the way, we thought we'd upgrade to the new technology.  Oops.  It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear (couldn't even make it to the other side of the house), and the reception was quite poor.  And the annoying beeping was the clincher.  I sent it back today and bought another $40 Ultra Clear.  Oh, and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also, and had the same issues.. 
 This book is a travesty. I'm a history student researching the death of Captain Cook. My prof. who gained his PhD from Yale suggested I read this book as a counterpoint for how historical research should be done, and presented. Obeyesekere is way out of his league in this book. First he claims to be an islander so he can relate to the natives (in fact he is 1/2 sri lankan and the other half is european). From taht point it goes down hill. The man's arguments while compelling on the surface are completely unfounded. If you actually read the footnotes of his arguments they site often his own articles and essays, or take comments from European acounts out of context that when read do not state at all what Obeyesekere says they do. Do not get taken in by the popular denial of the truth of Cook's death. This book represents an obvious vendeta against historians who know what they are talking and have true expertise in the field such as Sahlins.Who knows ancient Hawwian traditions, is an expert in ancient polynesean language and culture, and studied in many places in the south pacific. Unlike Obyesekere who has no background in any of these things. This is another great example of a man who is way out of his league atempting to make a name for himself by rocking the boat 
 I bought this book while I was living in America and have just gotten around to reading it.I wish I had not ,the pages are badly set out with to many side bars making it a pain to read .Also there is not enough good information in it to make it worth buying.A note to the editor if you produce this book for the British market you want to use another word than Tosser this is not a nice word over here and may offend some people 
 Contains some interesting ideas but those ideas are presented in rather verbose form and the writing sytle is not punchy enough.  On the whole I think this book is just OK 
 unless you are a complete newbie at ninja gaiden, this guide is worthless.  full of empty space and pictures with very little information.  the worst offense? "ALL ITEM LOCATIONS" in huge print on the cover.  But, as i discovered, this guide doesn't show item locations for level other than normal!! The guide has pretty much no discussion of strategy for weapons, even omitting strats for some weapons ( like kitetsu ) because they are "secret".  terribly uninformed and underresearched, this guide is a greivious offense to an amazing game 
 The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.  The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.  So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.    In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.  The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.  Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.  In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown "first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory."  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.  The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).  The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.  Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.  The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.  The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.  Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously 
 When I bought this book I did not realize that it was written after the movie.  It is not good Graham Greene.  The book follows the movie closely but, it adds very little.  As I read the story I miss the music.  Save your money and buy the DVD 
 First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.   I bought this book with 2 other books "The superhero book" (visible ink production) and "comic book encyclopedia" (ron goulart) and none of them satisfied me.   However "comic book encyclopedia" (ron goulart)is the only one which provides all superheroes with "pictures" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.   i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics 
 I did not like this book at all. I speak clearly but I want to be more articulate and hold my "audiences" attention.    The breathing exercises and banging out the ZZZZs and EE-I-EE-I-OOs did not help me.  Maybe I just don't understand what the author is trying to get across so it could actually be good information.  I also agree with one of the earlier reviewers that this author seems to just drop a lot of names.  It got a little old after a while 
 I found most of the information in Smith's book to be outdated and no longer useful.  A much better choice is "Guide to Careers in Federal Law Enforcement," by Thomas H. Ackerman, which is by far the best book  ever written on the subject.  Also, a good resource for background  information is "Handbook of Federal Police and Investigative  Agencies," by Donald A. Torres 
 I agree 100% with Mr. Steven Epstein's review (February 7, 2000), about Dr America: The Lives of Thomas A Dooley 1927-1961 by James Fishe 
 i agree with all the people that wrote the reviews. i found this hard, difficult and very upsetting and i still don't get it. they want you to buy their products for these boxes that aren't cheap and i have different products in the area i live in and i am just trying to do one correctly and get it done with all of the extra material i have and i can't seem to do one correctly. the directions are hard and very hard to understand. not clear at all. i am still trying to figure which part to put the material to. i bought a double sided adhesive and i just can't tell where to cut the material out at. very hard for a beginner. tracy  
 The material and ergonomics of this phone is average.  The selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line.  Below are the factors that I considered before purchasing and my experience:  Range:  The range of the phone is very good.  I can be 80-100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop.  Call Quality:  Average.  I have a Plantronics CS50 wireless headset that is on the 900 Mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit.  The call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear.  When I have switched during mid-conversation from the handset to headset, or vice-versa, callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call.  The Uniden is much more muffled and less clear.  It is however comparable to most cordless phone.  Not exceptional, but not bad.  Durability:  Average.  I have dropped my handsets on rare occasions, they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well.  One of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor, which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn't scratch the hardwood floor.  Special Note:  I suffered a power outage during a major windstorm.  The base unit will not boot up.  This appears to have happened to other reviewers.  This problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house.  On this issue, I have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars 
 This book seems to lack a voice. Considering that it is mostly quotes from other(and better) books about the german fighting man, it just didn't seem to flow well. The writing style reminded me of the terrible english papers I wrote for basic college writing. Besides that, it seemed like 50% of the quotes came from the Forgotten Soldier, making this book feel like a cliff notes version of Sajer's. In the time that it would take you to slog though this book, you could read two or three first hand accounts and form your own opinions 
 I place this book on the same level as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Yes, this is a book of fiction, but its entire portrayal of the goddess Kali--widely worshipped today in India, and elsewhere around the world--and Her worshippers is not only slanderous but dishonest.  I don't for a moment believe that the author actually thinks those who worship Kali are all child-murderers, sadists, and psychopaths...but those he fictionally portrays are.    Worse, he portrays Kali as a demon.  This is comparable to writing a fiction book portraying Mohammed as a child molester or Jehovah as a sadistic voyeur.  Kali is the obvious choice, the easy one, as She combines the famous Western combination of Occidental prurience and horror at Oriental depravity.  Kali superbly fills this bill, as She is naked, black, and rules the dimension of death.    Kali is unknown to the TV-watching West save through movies like "Gunga Din" and "Indiana Jones" (the one that has the hidden temple in it).  Both of these films are based on the myth of thuggee--the Thugs--a creation of the British colonial racist imagination.  Sleeman (the Brit responsible for this bit of slander) cobbled up "evidence" with no basis other than his own hearsay and considerable store of contempt for the "wogs," and presto--you have Kali the goddess of murder.   Simmons's book is simply another thuggee story, albeit set in a modern context.  I will not dignify this trash by writing more about it 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 This copyright is 1996....but initial copyright is 1889, and that is how it reads.  Bought for my granchildren who at 11 and 14 are offput by the style.  Recommend for historical value but not to improve history skills for today's generation...not going to happen 
 When we first bought our baby's mattress, it did not have any unusual odors at all. We washed the Ultimate Mattress Pad before using it, but after a short time, we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time. We finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench-free. By this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well. Use of the organic did not cause any problem, but since we had not yet put two and two together (not smart), we put the Ultimate Mattress Pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell. We now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress. The side that never came in contact with the Ultimate Mattress Pad smells just fine, but the side that we did use it on has a stench you don't want your baby sleeping on. I guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib. We actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we didn't want our little boy sleeping directly on it. When we did try that, he woke up with a mesh-imprinted face 
 In the process of building a website targeted to those good folks that are striving valiantly to make a living through Internet marketing, you might think that an early objective would be to assemble a library of good reference material. After all, if you are planning on providing sensible information to your readers, then you should have a few good text books on hand to refer to when you need to be sure that some little tidbit of information might actually work. Well, at least I did. So, I have been scouring the Internet for textbook on the subject of Forecasting, which we share a common interest in. I have purchased a few and, for the most part, they are really quite informative and will be useful when the time comes. There is, however, an exception to this.  One book I purchased bears the title "Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, Brockwell, Peter J and Richard A Davis". Being an intelligent sort of chap, I naturally took the word "Introduction" to mean just that. You know, you've been introduced to people before and becoming introduced usually means that 1. You look at the face. 2. You grasp their hand and shake firmly and 3. You exchange pleasantries, such as "Hello, it's nice to meet you".  Now, I never blame the person making the introduction if the relationship doesn't work out. After all, it's not their fault that two people hopefully sharing a common interest (after all, why bother making an introduction?) aren't all that compatible. There are likely to be many reasons for the incompatibility, the first of which could be that people travel in different circles and your circle isn't ever going to be part of their circle. Sort of an exclusionary relationship, you might say. And, not to be overly judgmental of others, of course, there may be plenty of good reasons for that. If everyone existed in one social circle, after all, the world would be beyond boring.  Anyways, the text book is a wonderful creation, that is, if you're a post-graduate or doctoral candidate. Upon opening the cover, expecting to be warmly introduced, I was rather amazed at the depth of equations and formulas gracing practically every page. I felt intimidated immediately. Remember the movie "The Ring"? This had to be rocket science, or more correctly, forecasting science at its most extreme! Wow! I should have really paid more attention during my statistics classes. So, I quickly closed the cover and tried to get a refund from the seller. Note the word Tried here. They didn't want it back either. The good Post-Grand and PhD. candidates of the science of forecasting probably don't need an "Introduction" to Time Series and Forecasting. Next time I buy a book, I think I'll look for something with "Sandbox" in the title.  May all your Forecasts be Good Forecasts at [...] 
 i hated this book with a paaion. i had to read it in english class last year ansd it was the worst book i have every read in my entire life. dont read it!! 
 i'm a guy that has gone more than 1,001 days without sex!  girls can get sex whenever they want.. i even know fat, ugly girls who have sex.  but nobody would read a book if i wrote one.  it's a pretty boring story, really.  "well hmm let's see, most girls have boyfriends.. i'm not too exciting or outgoing..  i gained weight.."  wow, who cares?!  i have friends who went for about 5 years without sex, too, and they were funny, interesting, wonderful people.  they don't feel the need to write a book about it, though.  life sucks. get over it!  
 Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this book. Nowhere did it say that this is a coloring book, so the title page is deceiving with its nice colors. For an older child who is crazy about coloring (because of the very busy and detailed scenes) this may be something, otherwise you can't even make out much on the black-and-white scenes. My toddler picks it up often because of the colorful title page and then is always disappointed once we open it. As a German mother, it therefore has no value for me in teaching my child German, which is too bad. 
 sensationalist, titiliating, and as a result, a total let-down (much like "heavier than heaven")  while Cross's journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re: Jimi's early years, after that, it reads like "Hammer of the Gods" meets the National Inquirier.  just plain silly, and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever.  Cross spends more time examining Jimi's proclivity for groupies and drugs (which, of course, is part of the story...i guess), than the music itself.  It would have been nice to know, say:  In 1966, preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame NYC, how did Hendrix come to write the songs that comprised "Are You Experienced"?  how did his playing transcend his predecessors?  how did dylan influence his songwriting?  (we learn Hendrix *did* emulate Dylan's hair.)  we don't know.  now, if Cross was unable to formulate  answers on his own, then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics, musicians, and fans who'd be happy to extrapolate.    instead we get only crumbs, which are ultimately overshadowed by second-hand stories from druggies ("jimi didn't like alcohol!", ex-groupies ("jimi wanted to marry me!", and hangers-on ("jimi slept with 8 chicks at once.")  it was thorougly exasperating.  if you came from Mars and read this, your impression would be that yes, Jimi was messed up and reckless; but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world.  if the book meant to honor Hendrix, it did the opposite.    if you want incisive analysis of the *music* itself, simply read Amazon readers' reviews of his records.  The fans themselves -- not an overwrought author -- can encapsulate the power and beauty of Hendrix far better, and far more consisely. 
 I like the music but the volume swings are far too big for any of my four sound systems to cope with. Constantly using the volume control 
 I wanted wanted wanted to love this book. I wanted wanted wanted to..... But not. I bought it because it was one someone's list who read a lot of books that I really enjoyed....  but probably specifically because I just finished Richard Morgan's books (which had digitized conciousness as a major theme -- which played a big part in this one).....  Now, I am a big fan of great storyline, interesting characters as number 1 and number 2 driving forces..... However, the HUGE lack of number 3 makes me give this only two stars....  And number 3 is:  LOGICAL CHARACTER MOTIVATION!   I really did not understand why the characters in this book did what they did.  And that was really a let down.  It seemed amateur-ish in a way....  Relationships flipflopped.....  Friends betrayed friends....  and I sat there, reading, not understanding why......  I'm not even over my first century (being in my mid 30s), and I can still understand my (and my friends) motivations.....  Maybe I'm just naive?  Yes, the digitized conciousness was interesting.  The world that was built (ad hoc and Bitchun and Whuffie?) was interesting....  There were good parts.....  but I really didn't grasp the motivations and why the characters did what they did, and I nearly put the book aside because of that.  It was really not up to the reviews here on Amazon.....  So, I would say that the ideas and world was cool and interesting --- but, personally I would say that Richard K. Morgan does it better.  Very differently, less light-hearted, darker, but fuller and richer, more complex and meaty....   
 This book was useless. It is a great idea to have a book about conception however this book fails to live up to the lofty task. I think my biggest complaint with the book is the fact that the book is dull and really doesn't go into terffic detail about how life changes after a baby. Or practical step to take before getting pregnant. Instead it focuses to much on diet not enough on the huge emtional changes. 
 While this book covers all of the key elements of good training and racing, there are better books available on nutrition and training strategies (especially since the book is now almost ten years old).  The book focuses on Sebastian Coe and uses him as an example.  This only works to a point since most people didn't end up with his genes.  If you are coaching young runners (many without Sebastian Coe's body or personality) and tried to use the mental conditioning section uniformly with each runner you would lose or ruin a good share of them 
 This is the first CD of this group that I purchased...it is ok, kinda boring...Love the first song...kinda goes down hill from there...this will not play in my CD player that much...wish that i would have waited for something else to come along...but ya dont know till you try it.. 
 ok,last time,this is friends the one with all the babies=0  this is friends complete seasons sets=5     any questions 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 I agree totally with Yau in the previous review. Mr. Winchester is more interested in sharing the British (yawn) history of China, not giving us much else about the culture and beauty of the Yangtze and its people. I have been to China 2&1/2 wks and also taken a cruise (5 days) of the Yangtze and for him to make it all so boring is more than annoying, it is almost criminal. Perhaps his ego supersedes him. I would not buy this book, in fact I was uanble to even read more than a couple chapters, it was that boring and dry. The one by Mr. Hessler is an absolute winner.  I read it once a year at least to refresh my amazing memories of China 
 This is total disrespect to the best MC of all time.  They took his amazing style and talent and mixed him with subpar rappers, with sub par beats. Absolute garbage 
 EVEN THOUGH HE IS THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE DIPSET CREW AND DIRECTS VIDEOES AS WELL BEHIND THE CAMERA,WHY DOES HE WANT TO RAP ANYWAY?,YOUR PAID, JIM NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO IT BUT I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS THOUGH IM NOT GOING TO KNOCK THAT WHATS SO EVER,IT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS TO PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE LIKE THAT,ANYWAY I LIKED THE "MIAMI JOINT" WITH TREY, DAM I HOPE HIS NEXT ALBUM IS WAY BETTER,BECAUSE HIS PIPES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF TO WASTE ON WACK SONGS,THERE'S A FEW IPOD WORTHY TRACKS BUT THE KEY WORD IS "FEW "  ENOUGH SAID  (OUT 
 This book comes across as severely dated and lame.  All the people who love this book are either nerds who think they're in on Pynchon's "joke" or they are nerds who havent read a good book like Catch-22. 
 I was intrigued with the title, but understood nothing of the lyrics.  As most of rap (hip hop) this is incredible garbage.  only my opinion of course.  
 I like self-reference jokes. I enjoy them quite a bit, actually. But this book beats you over the head with it. I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is. But I don't really care, I hated it. 
 very disappointing publication-suggest you save your money and check it out of the library before making a decision-the front cover was deceptive in its allure to those looking for a creative nudge in decorating tuscany style. but the most chilling part of this book,for me, was a revealing paragraph at the top of page 106 'quote' Given that the farmers probably will not be returning.I begin to plot new purposes for the hundreds of borghi in the italian hills: music camps,artists' colonies,hospices, religious retreat centers. After all,easily taking the past into the future is part or the italian genius for living.'unquote'... well, there goes he neighborhood! i'm just thankful i got to see Tuscany before the Mayes' makeover of the whole region --some people just can't leave rustic charm alone!!...norm 
 ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON  
 I recieved this book from a friend after losing my daughter to still birth at nearly 7 months. The comparison of my family's loss to a "flight that departed just a bit early" enraged me rather than provide any comfort.  The very fact that the author could make such a shoddy comparison is a clear indicator that a tragedy of this magnitude has never touched his life.   The book continues with what I am sure were meant to be good intentions( which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one) but slowly unravels to a very thinly disguised guilt inducing essay on " aren't you sorry now you had an abortion".  This book deals very little with the heartbreak of a death of a baby that you had no power to save, it does nothing to assuage the hearts of the parents of miscarriage, stillbirth, or babies lost shortly after birth.   I do not reccomend this book if any of those events are what you are going thru now.   
 OMG THEY KILLED IRREPLACEABLE!!!!! these lil brats cant sing in the first place. they should stick to bawling out their abc's in the shower. but why must we sane people suffer through this CRUD?!?!?! for all you sane haters, dont buy this. these songs have ADULT CONTENT in them. little kids need to stick to PBS KIDS, not MTV! these songs go way 2 high for their voices. and the adults? i think they used to be turture devices. honestly. if you dont believe me, buy it while i buy the real version.  one more thing. the "cute" lil 'z' at the end? no 
 THE GIRL IN THE CAFE starts out with promise, the promise being to be a sweet May-December love story. Bill Nighy is Lawrence, an aging bachelor working for the government as a financial expert who meets a lovely young girl (Kelly Macdonald) in a cafe during coffee break. Mr. Nighy does a nice acting turn as the twitchy, shy older man and Ms. MacDonald as does a fine job as the adorable if undistinguished girl in the cafe. It's an unlikely but possible match that progresses when Lawrence asks Gina to go to a high-level international conference with him in Iceland. It is at that point that THE GIRL IN THE CAFE stops being a romance and starts becomming a political movie. Gina suddenly loses her sweetness and becomes rude, pushing her leftist political agenda, which, by the way, hardly anyone in the movie disagrees with. They are just not going far enough for the politically correct Gina. Gina's political outbursts are an amazing show of disrespect for Lawrence, who invited her on the Iceland junket in the first place, as it puts him at odds with his boss, the target of Gina's political salvos. It was at this point, having been disappointed in not getting a sweet, May-December romance and instead a vehicle for leftist political views, I decided it wasn't worth it and turned the DVD off, the victim of a bait and switch. If you are a lefty, the girl in the cafe's rants will be music to your ears. If so, hang in there; the second half of the movie may be worth it to you. 
 You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his 
 This is the best diet product ever!  I tried them all and "SKINNY WATER?" is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever.  The product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much.  I drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away.  I lost 15 lbs. in 20 days.  Great taste, it works great, and it's so inexpensive.  Great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight.  The owners should hire me to do commercials for them 
 This story began as a real gut-wrencher with a kidnapping and its devastating impact on the victimized family. However, it was difficult to ever sympathize with the mother because she came across as so selfish throughout the book. That could be forgiven, but the ending (which I will not give away) was so ridiculously implausible that it ruined the entire book. By that point the story had pretty much run out of steam anyway, so it would have been difficult for any ending to wrap things up satisfactorily. This book would have gone nowhere had it not been pimped by Oprah 
 There is a used book available for 73 cents. If you pay that price, you are overpaying by 50 cents 
 This is not a review of the Criterion edition. I have seen several of their productions, and they are the best! This is about this movie.  This film is sick. Very sick. I am not a prude. I am a grown up gay man with rather radical views.  Still this film made me throw up when I saw it while preparing to write an essay on the director for a gay, cultural magazine. I am aware of Pasolinis intentions of describing the real inner life and dephts of fascism, and I hate anything that even comes near to fascist views, even ordinary right wing views.  And still: This is the most evil film I have ever seen. To think up this film, even with the literary source of it as a background, Pasolini had to use his own imagination. And I am glad I never knew a person with such an imagination (at least I hope I don't know any such person). And worst of all: The young kids in the movie had to go through these scenes, to act out this sick story. To do those things! I do really hope they have been taken good care of ever since! I do not understand how it can be high art, except for being very professionally acted and photographed.  For the rest of it: I will never watch as much as a minute of this film again! After viewing it I had to watch The Sound of Music three times. In a row! That was the best thing I could think of, just to get the images of this film away. But they are still there. Two years later. Do not watch this! You can't ever really escape its images, and you do not want to carry them around with you. There are other ways to find out what fascism is. This is only pollution 
 Unlike other scholars, Jackson defends paradigms complementary. This book, which comes up with some interesting methodologies for social systems analyses, leads to folly conclusions 
 Mr. Friedman's book begins with an interesting thesis, defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth.  The idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that Friedman often well supports with historical facts.  However, the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis, or if he just felt the need to write a book.  Furthermore, for every chapter in the book, there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that, with a little thorough thought or research, don't make sense or can easily be disproven.  With these things being the case, I find Friedman's argument a little hard to buy.  The entire book seems to build up to the final chapter, which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth; this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely, however, because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book (ie. the importance of education) do not add or support his final policy recommendations.  His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question "What should the government do to promote economic growth?"  They don't push the argument forward or indicate anything that hasn't already been suggested in the past, nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies.  
 Like the Blues Brothers, the main purpose of UB40 is to introduce listeners to music they might not be familiar with. It is then hoped the listener will go out and find the original material, and then you would see that this is a pallid imitation. When you realize this band's best cover is a Neil Diamond tune on a CD with Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff songs, you see how authentic UB40 really is. To their credit, just due is given to the original artists in the liner notes. If you like this CD do yourself a favor, and listen to the original recordings 
 This collection of "poems" is embarrassingly bad from beginning to end. Little more than notes, the stuff would not be published if it weren't Snyder. He has done nothing since the Beats, and did very little back then. Why bother publishing him at all 
 H&R block does a much better job marketing software than writing it. I used the on-line version, had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later. After about an hour of painfully slow entry, sometimes just one item per page, most of the time looking at "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT" I had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save. No luck, repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error, and I could not save without registering. Finally just left the computer on and left; when I came back TaxCut had timed out and lost all my data. By the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies. Even if you select NO you will get frequent e-mails from H&R Block. I will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year. When a company can't get something simple like this right, it calls into question everything they do 
 This is by far, without a doubt, the single-handedly most God-awfully, hideously sterile, boring piece of literature ever produced by mankind. I have heard a rumor that hospitals are going to start making patients read this book in lieu of anaesthesia before conducting surgery 
 One of the best books I have ever read. It was engaging and informative and read like a great novel. I did not want it to end 
 Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.  There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery. 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 A friend bought this table for my daughter when she was about 18 mo old.  She is now 3 and I have a 8 1/2 mo old and we will be throwing this table in the trash.  First of all, the cookie monster part does not work - it never has.  Secondly, at odd times e.g. 3 o'clock in the morning, it will start making it's noises and singing songs for no reason.  Finally, and most importantly, it falls over whenever my son leans on it.  We were going to give it away because it was kind of annoying but because it is also dangerous we will now just throw it in the trash.  Do not buy this toy 
 This book was too predicatable, I could see the plot coming miles ahead. A big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops, and he doesn't even have a gun, all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain. You knew Goldie would turn out to be a hooker, and if that's a spoiler for you. You need to read more fiction and/or watch more sopa operas. The characters aren't that complex, rather two-dimensional and to make matters worse, Miller doesn't even give a twist in the plot. For the record, there have been a number of people who claim to work for God that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes. The Crusades for one. So, Miller you don't get any points from me on that one. Now for those of you that are saying. "Hey it's only a comic book, a big one but a comic nonetheless." I say, "That is BULLL!!" Read: watchmen, The Judas Contract, Future Imperfect, and The League part one and two. Oh and Elfquest and then tell me if a comic book can't be well, this no story piece of crap 
 I thought the book was appropriate for a young adult. I ended up giving it to my neighbors three year old son because it was more of a toddlers picture book. I felt the book was misrepresented online. 
 The idea of this book was great but unfortunately it was disappointing.  It does not go into enough detail into any of the managers' investment processes to be able to apply them.  I would suggest reading instead The Intelligent Investor, John Neff on Investing, or The Warren Buffet Way.                   
 I was disappointed with the album as a whole.  When I heard the song "Drink to Me Babe, Then", I thought it was great and sounded like The Shins.  The rest of the album was boring lyrically 
 Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site.  I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them.  There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something.   
 I hope her knowledge of American Indian culture is sounder than her grasp of English history. I spotted some howlers, several repeated in the text: King James "VII" of Scotland (make that James VI) was NOT Queen Elizabeth's nephew. Nor was Queen Elizabeth England's first Protestant monarch (the honours go to her brother Edward VI) I could go on, but you get the idea ... Read this one with a heaping tablespoonful of sal 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 I am not an expert by any means on lounge/ambient music.  I started with Costes - la Suite, and have acquired a taste for Costes, Thievery Corporation (including their recent compilation The Outernational Sound), Air, Zero 7 and others in this space.  That said, Buddha Bar VI was my introduction to the Series.  The CD is for the most part an uninspired compilation of music.   It has is good tracks, no doubt, but the general experience is very inconsistent.  You will find a few good  tracks surrounded by pretty average ambient music. I also noticed a bit of an abuse on some pretty average electronic sounds and effects and very little moments in which you feel that you are listening to truly creative material.  If you want to try a great compilation I absoultely recommend to start with Costes (la Suite or Vol 2. is my favorite and Hotel costes 6 is also highly recommended).  The elegance of the compilation, the great moments on most of the tracks and the moments of brilliance are a far superior experience than listening to Buddha Bar VI.  If this CD were one of a few options out there, it might not be such a bad option.  But compared to other available options (Costes or not) it does not hold its own very well. 
 A pop rock band with a violin?  I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  It's not like the band sucks, they're good musicians if you're into that poppy sound, but the violin just confuses me.  There's a time and place for violin in rock music, with an ensemble arrangement for example, but not solo.  IMHO 
 I swear I am abou to STOP spending my money on any old books!! I have read like 3 terrible books in a row!!!  I really enjoyed "Sins Of The Father" and have looked forward to this book "Back On The Block", but I wish I had ordered something else instead. This book was all over the place and the storyline does not match the description on the back of the book. I gave up after like 6 or 7 chapters....AWFUL!!! 
 We never recieved our book, we were told it was out of date, which it isn't.  When we tried to contact the seller we got no reply.  I have been too busy to check if I was billed or not.  Can't you help 
 Hawaii for Dummies was not usable and light when it came to driving details.  We should have splurged and bought a book for each of the islands we visited:  Kauai, Oahu and Maui.  Now you know 
 Within an hour of removing this set of earphones from it's packaging, i found the sound went out in the left earphone unless it's adjustable clip was placed in very particular way.  I should've returned the item at that point.   I didn't, and over the next 45 days the right earphone followed suit. Also, the rubber rings around thephones fell off and were lost.  These may be common problems with earphones, but at $40.00 this is a terrible value.  My $7.00 Sony earphones sounf as good and have not shown to be as fragile. 
 While I purchased the CD for the title song, I was a little disappointed in the rest of the CD. I guess I didn't know the group's repertoire as well as I thought 
 I can't work out what this band is trying to do. There are elements of metal, punk, riot grrl, and grunge, all of which are handled in the most rudimentary way. If music is inconsequential to you and all you're looking for is a cute unconventional singer to worship, then Jack Off Jill may be the band for you. If you're looking for good tunes you won't find them here.  
 Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme.  It's certainly pleasant to look at. The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  The story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither).  The acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic.  But the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its "thriller" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst.  This movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.)  If a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There's some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension.  I'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way.  I haven't read the book, but I bet it's a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud.   
 This book is terrible. It trades on the good name of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice, then completely ignores the P&P story.  There's nothing in the book that convinces me that Ms. Aston ever read Pride and Prejudice. I think she has only read a cliff notes version of the story. Here's my criticisms in a nutshell:  First - Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are not in the book. Second - Col. Fitzwilliam is an old, lecherous scold. Third - The P&P characters that are in the book are totally unrecognizable, except for their names. Fourth - I didn't believe for one minute that Mr. Darcy's daughters were the product of Mr. Darcy or Elizabeth. Fifth - It was boring 
 Mohamed Sifaoui's book claims to be an account of how the author infilterated the world's dealiest terrorist organization but ends up providing exaggerated description of rambling youth in search of identity in a foreign country. The writer makes use of his being a Muslim to sell a book that really is nothing more than a diary about his meetings with characters who are too simple and trusting to be terrorists 
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 A friend of ours bought this for us as a gift. I'm glad we didn't spend any money on it. Every time we've tried to make any of these recipes, they haven't turned out. I get the feeling most of these weren't tested before they were put into the book 
 It's an OK product but when using the stubble attachment it snags and pulls on the beard.  I have exchanged the item twice and the same result.  Too bad, I really like the length of the stubble guide attachment 
 this listing isen't correct. item NTS1 is a nylon tank top shirt, not a t-shirt 
 The newest version of Arena is 5.0 . This book teaches based on the version 3.0 
 If you want to kill your time without learning anything, this book is absolute right for you 
 This book is way too short for such an interesting topic. Another problem is that it depicts women as main victims of weird medical practices in 19th and early 20th century, which is not entirely true. At those times (and may be true today in some cases also) one would be far better off if one stayed away from medical profession. Also, there are some really hillarious things about treating hysteria which authors didnot bother to mention. For the hystory of vibrators as legitimate medical treatment for hysteria, Rachel Maines has done very good job in dealing with this topic. What is also a pity is that authors didn't pursue various medical superstitions about females and different treatment of females which are present in modern times. For example, nobody questions the articles published in peer reviewed medical journal which state that patient's absolute refusal is "relative contraindication" for performing episiotomy. Is there any other surgical procedure which can be inflicted on a patient against patient's explicitly stated wishes? Or for example the fact that many health insurances cover Viagra but don't cover contraceptives. There are many topics well worth investigation which belog to the topic "Complaints and Disorders : The Sexual Politics of Sickness" which authors have chosen not to address in this pamphlet (can't even call it a book) 
 I have been reading science fiction for about 40 years and the best I can recall, this is one of my least favorite.  Although some may like Jon Courtenay Grimwood's style of writing (if this is representative, not having read any before) I found it very hard to follow and very disjointed.  Although the central idea of the novel is a good one, the author, in my opinion, seems to wander away from the story line to provide meaningless details that tend to confuse the reader.  I have made it about half way through the novel but I am finding it very hard to complete 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 Sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as Consulting for Dummies. The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant; But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking. Overall, I think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant. While for beginner, the reader will risk the wrong impression that it's this easy to win a consulting work - highly unlikely in a complex and competative world 
 The suit will make you sweat if that's what you are looking to do.  I had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs, but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam.  I was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine.  It will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses, but buy something more substantial for a serious workout.  You truly do get what you pay for 
 I think the biggest problem with this book is that it was published and edited by his parents.  I admit I thought it was pretty bad, in fact it was some of the worst fantasy I have ever read.  When a real editer would have helped this very weak writing come up to snuff, instead his parents went along with him 
 "With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. "  "Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit."  It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however 
 I like that you can customize your workout or use a pre programed one. There is the option of only having music and no talking which is nice. The cardio segments are about 13 minutes each and the toning segments are about 5. There is a total toning segment and it is about 10 minutes. The cardio didn't get my heart beat elevated like some other dvds I have. The toning segments had good exercises, but my muscles didn't feel tired after doing them. I think this dvd is geared more towards beginners 
 I got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun. Well...it caught my interest for a few weeks then I just got bored with it. I'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily 
 The Russian nuclear powered, missile carrying (SSBN) submarine K-219 was about 15 years old when it nearly triggered either WWIII or a 2nd Chernobyl.  In 1986, with Chernobyl still in minds of the public, and the Reagan/Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik imminent, the navies of both sides of the cold war sail SSBN's off each other's shore.  Floating platforms loaded with numerous missiles - some with multiple warheads - these subs are almost as dangerous to their crews as they are to the enemy.  In the case of K-219, the balance shifted firmly against the crew.  Poor design, construction and shipyard maintenance had prematurely aged the sub launched only a few years earlier than the first 688-class American subs.  Near Bermuda, K-219 was nearly sunk by a missile explosion caused by leaking seawater.  With one tube already deactivated because of seawater problems on a prior cruise, this was not a new problem.  In this case however, the explosion nearly sinks the then submerged boat, then floods it with toxic and corrosive gas.  Problems increase when the ships two reactors suffer a loss-of-coolant accident and nearly meltdown.  Echoing the experience of K-19, some brave crewmen sacrifice themselves to shut the reactors down.  Complications ensue when superiors in Moscow order the crew (once safely evacuated to a nearby freighter) to re-board the poisoned ship.  An American sub with a maverick commander adds to the danger when he runs his ship too near the stricken sub, apparently ordered to keep K-219 from being recovered.  Eventually, the ship will sink, and Captain Britanov will have to return home and answer to his superiors for the loss of the sub.  The loss of K-219 is a fascinating story, but unfortunately this book doesn't do it justice.  The cause of the book's numerous flaws is the author's determination to write it as if it were a novel, in which the facts, if not complete, are still single-minded.  That is, despite an extensive bibliography, there's only one version of the account.  Rather than document possible disputes over what happened, or why people act the way they did, "Hostile waters" offers a single, linear perspective, one with easily identifiable heroes and villains (the political officer is singled out for unpopularity even before he grabs the first lifeboat off K-219 - since he does nothing throughout the story he's an easy target).  This is not only a monumental cheat, but also robs the reader of critical facts - such as what really caused the ship to sink as it did; also the circumstances surrounding the apparently feckless captain of the American sub, and whether any blame should attach to Britanov for not knowing of the leaking missile tube or the painful domestic situation of the officer directly responsible for monitoring it.  "Hostile Waters" reads like a novel - a very unrealistic one 
 I think Eggers is a really good (sometimes fantastic) writer, but I also think he needs some help paring things down and coming up with a book that doesn't grind you down.  I've read both his books and scanned them at the end.  I sometimes think he's playing games, seeing what he can get the critics to buy into.  I can't believe the hype surrounding his books, the awestruck accolades.  I doubt that half those critics ever made it through the books.  I'll leave it at that, because I agree with most of the negative commentary on previous posts.  Eggers is an excellent writer in spurts, but I think he's a bit (ok, a lot) arrogant and needs a good editor 
 Break out your 8-track tapes, I just found this tape,listened to it and it's baaaad!  I see others comparing this to the "Steve Perry" era of Journey, saying this album is better than that era - don't be fooled!  The Steve Perry Journey is only Journey you need, this is a better album than the first album which is mostly instrumentals.  "On A Saturday Night" prevents me from giving this zero stars.  Far out!  
 I bought this product from the Discovery Channel Store and I really want to love it, but all of the green colored lights stopped working a couple weeks after I bought it.  I returned to the store where I was given a new fountain, but the same exact thing happened to the new one just a couple weeks later.  The mister still works well, but the LED lights are unpredictable at best 
 If you are looking for a directory on CHRISTIAN spiritual retreats, then this book is for you. However, for those of us looking for a spiritual, yet non-religious experience, then this guide is not helpful. I was hoping this directory would help me find spiritual retreats embracing a variety of practices. It did not. Otherwise, it is a well-organized and thorough guide within its narrow focus 
 I have been reading and enjoying the works of the late Robert A. Monroe for many years.  Rosalind McKnight's accounts of the features and experiences in the etheric plane are consistent with other accounts.  However, I was 150 pages into this book and all of a sudden it occurred to me - how can any of this possibly be true?  How is it possible to be astrally projected out of one's physical body and still be hearing questions from the control room in the lab and still be verbally answering questions with one's physical mouth while one is in another dimension?  Sounds funny to me.  I would find it more credible if the author wrote down recollections of her experiences after she had returned to the physical plane.  As far as I'm concerned, You can't be two places at once 
 I liked this book very much when I started reading it.  The authors' characterizations of sailing were right on the money.  The characters and plot start out interesting but it seems the book was rushed to a sloppy and confusing ending that left me dissatisfied and wanting more.  I kept waiting for somthing to tie things together, but it never happened 
 Theologically, this book was out of date for me, focusing too much on just "Christian worship" without considering the growing awareness of cultural influences from other religious sources.  It was also too evangelical for me, preferring a much more unitarian approach.  It will work for some, but if people begin asking deeper questions about our historical resources, it will come up short.  
 My husband and I are avid "Grey's Anatomy" watchers.  I enjoy the music I hear on the show and thought I would enjoy this CD.  Not only was it awful, I didn't recognize any of the tracks except the theme song used to lead into the show.  This is a terrible CD; one I would consider taking immediately to trade in 
 I loath using this book.  I only own it because my courses required that I have it.  The book is very poorly made.  Often times the book will begin derivations or explanations of certain solutions or methods refering to a figure that can be several pages away.  Turning back and forth becomes quite combersome.  Also, the example problems are very generalized, typically not giving any real numbers but rather stating knowns and unknowns.  The problems at the end of the chapters don't have all answers listed in the back of the book.  If you are working a problem and need to check answers, its a toss up if will be able to verify if you used the proper solution.  All these things with the fact that the text is very tighty compacted an jumbled with very shoddy derivations at times, this book was very poorly contrived.  The book does one thing in that it bold's important terms and italisizes thier defintions but that is been the norm for text since I was a child in grade school I would hope that some one like R. C. Hibbeler would make a text that deals with mechanical systems.  I consider his texts on Dynamics as well as statics to be excellent in terms of both lay out and content.   With that in mind, now you know my standard for comparrision.  I detest using this text so much, I've been compelled to write this review.  If you a student reading this, sorry and good luck.  If your a professor, do your class a favor and find another text 
 I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read 
 I was stunned by how bad this CD sounds.  I'm no expert, so I can't give you a precise description with proper terminology.  Suffice it to say it's a bad job of transferring the recordings to CD.  I later bought the Gold version, and the difference is like night and day.  Judy Collin's voice is too wonderful to let this awful CD prevent you from really hearing her.  The Gold version is worth the extra money 
 This book was pretty bad. I listened to it as a book on tape unabridged. In many ways this is a better format to enjoy a book than actually reading it in my opinion, so please don't groan and dismiss what I say because of that. The reason I say that I listened to this book is that it forced me to hear every single written word and I am sure that if I were to have held it in my hands instead I would have flipped past half the pages to figure out how it ended. What bugs me to no end about this book and the author is that he has taken a couple of ideas (a missing FBI file, a rock climbing lady, an honest FBI guy on the outs with the system, and crooked politicians) and then proceeded to play these against each other with reckless abandon. Mills pretty much tugs every possible tried and true method to further a weak ass plot. The end result is a painful display of shoddy writing that gives his genre a bad name.  Tom Clancy actually gave this book a pretty good couple of review quotes and is mentioned on the books cover. I wonder how much he was paid to write a couple nice lines. In my opinion, Clancy wrote a few pretty good reads early on but has turned out some incredible trash as of late, and I say this because Free Fall is a lot like one of Clancy's later books. If you want a comparison, this might be an apt one. MIlls does have potential however, much of what he wrote was almost good and I look forwards to reading his work in a few years. 
 John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Dario Argento, Joe Dante, Don Coscarelli, Takashi Miike. These are but some of the powerhouse names in horror that were enlisted to direct episodes of "Masters of Horror", a 13-episode series that debuted last fall on the Showtime network. Comparisons to other TV horror anthologies such as Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone and Friday the 13th were inevitably made but "Masters" decidedly differs from those in several aspects as there is no host, no commercials and little trace of humor/camp. No, Masters of Horror is a no-holds barred hardcore horror anthology that gives full creative freedom to its directors, many of them names that have been known to not pull any punches whatsoever.   What I particularly like about the show is that there is no guiding voice, or TV producer, telling the director how things should be. Each episode has the director's own personal stamp on it, to give us the feeling that "This is not a masters of horror episode, it's a Dario Argento movie, or a Takashi Miike movie, etc." The result of this creative freedom and unique concept is an anthology where every episode feels uniquely distinct from one another.  "Chocolate" is directed by the series creator himself, Mick Garris.  Garris said he got the idea to make this show at a horror-director's luncheon where he approached the directors with the idea and the rest, as we all know, is history.  Garris has made a name for himself within made-for-TV horror, in particular through his numerous Stephen King adaptations such as "Sleepwalkers", "The Stand", "The Shining (TV)", "Riding the Bullet" and more recently, "Desperation".    Story:  A Chicago man (played by Henry Thomas) who creates artificial flavors for the food industry begins to experience the sensations of a female unknown to him through sight, sound, smell, touch.  Pretty soon he becomes obsessed with this female stranger who he's never met and goes to Vancouver to attempt to track her down.  How ironic that the series creator's entry would be perhaps the most mediocre of the series.  First off, this doesn't feel like horror but more like a mediocre episode of The Outer Limits.  Not a terrible one, just a mediocre one.  It's presented to us as a weird character study yet I felt little emotional attachment to the character even as he stumbles through painfully awkward moments to watch such as when he spazzes out in bed next to a girl he brought home for the night and when his ex-wife and son stumble onto them.  Moments like this make this episode thoroughly unpleasant to watch (and I don't mean this in a good way, horror fans of the world).    Worst of all, the story and its denouements make NO sense whatsoever.  What led to all this?  If it's somehow meant to be due to a workplace incident involving the chemicals he works with then how come his co-worker didn't catch it too?  Then we find out that the girl feels the same things he does, even though they're total strangers who live hundreds of miles apart and who've never met, now somehow psychically linked together?   Argh!!!  This story felt like it was written as a brainstorming experiment gone horribly wrong.  So why bother watching "Chocolate"?  Well, there's plenty of hot chicks.  Who get semi-nude.  That's the only valid reason I can think of, from a male point of view.  Also, Masters of Horror completists such as myself will have to watch it, but that's it.  Everyone else should stay away. 
 Honestly, i think this album's not half as good as MOT.  as a matter of fact, it's worse than their 1990 release, 'step in the arena'.  it's just an okay album 
 I got hooked on Tiesto about 5 years ago. Heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album. Neverhteless, it wasn't but it was still tiesto though right? Well...the hits on this CD are about 5 years old. The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better 
 I purchased this case in pink about a month ago, and I feel much safer carrying it around in my purse or backpack. It really protects the screen and everything nicely with the leather. I also enjoy the kickstand, which is very handy when watching videos or pictures, and the way it snaps in the back is convenient. However:   1. Having to take it out of case out to charge and dock etc., minor setback but one nonetheless.  2. The buttons don't work as easily in the case. Many times I'll go to pause a song and it'll flip to the next one instead because the edge of the leather where it's cut for the scrollpad is on the 'next song' button. Most of the time I end up taking the player out of the case when I use it because it's a lot less frustrating that way.  3. Bulky. Again, it just hinders the use of the player and I'm amazed at how thin it actually is when I take it out to dock or charge (which with the battery life is several times a week haha).   4. I'm not sure if this has happened with other color cases, but my case has left pink stains all over the back of my player. Luckily my player is black so just the back is stained, but I'm sure white players or maybe even the other 3 colors could get stains on the front too.   So if you couldn't tell, I really wasn't satisfied. It's too late to return mine (believe me, if I could, I would), and the only reason I'm not getting a different case is because it was over $30 with shipping and to spend another 20 would be a bit rediculous. My friend got one of the flexiskin covers and they seem to allow use of the player much better, although I'm not sure how well they protect the screen.    Bottom line-- I highly, highly recommend getting a case for your player-- just not this one. The Vision:M is an amazing and fairly expensive player that deserves to be protected, and while this case does that, the design poor really hinders the use more than it helps 
   When I saw this book I was really excited because I thought "another chicken soup for the soul book!" Well I was wrong! I couldn't believe how corny and fake the stories were. and the themes created by the authors throughout the chapters made it even worse. The book claims to be original but it is really a take off of the chicken soup for the souls and an awful one at that! i havent even finished the book yet and i don't think i ever will! if you want to read REAL stories by real teens then the chicken soup for the soul books are the way to go!! not these books!! 
 The title, front and back cover contents is leading the reader to believe not to vaccinate. I am anti-vaccine, so after reading through 1/2 of the book I put it away. The book makes one aware of some dangers of vaccinations but still does condone them. It does not tell us to "Stop the Shots" as the title suggests. I do NOT recommend it to people that want to educate themselves that vaccines ARE dangerous and really want to "Stop the Shots" 
 I cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par Testament release.  Testament must have taken hints from Metallica and tried to attract a different audience.  This is not a horrible album, but compared to any other Testament album, it is easily their worst.  Only the die-hard Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this up.    
 It's crammed full of facts & figures, but like one reviewer mentioned, there is no discussion of Medical Insurance rates or plans--something hugely important to a lot of Americans these days.  I should mention I've made several house-hunting trips to Maine myself. I was hoping this book this book would "fill in the gaps" for me; but I don't think it even really covers a lot of what I already knew. Besides all the dry statistics, there are testamonials from people who've moved to Maine, & by Gosh, every single one of them absolutely loves it(!). You think there might be one or two people who ever DIDN'T enjoy living in Maine? Not according to this book.  Her other book, Where to Retire in Maine, is somewhat more useful than this IMO; I'd probably give it 3 stars (altho it didn't even cover some of the nicest areas near Portland). I've also ordered the "Moon Handbooks: Maine 2 Ed": often good travel guidebooks can provide tons more useful information about places than some of the "moving to..." books.    
 I am a big fan of Michael Connelley's.  He usually writes about very bright police officers.   I do not know why he wandered so far away from familiar territory, but he has managed to create a character -- Henry Pierce -- who may be a genius, but is also unbelievably stupid.   I cannot accept the reasons that he tries to learn about a missing escort simply because he was given her former phone number.   He not only puts his life at risk but his entire company and the careers of his associates.  I was so disappointed in Henry Pierce that I began to side with those who wanted to arrest him or kill him.   That might have been the most satisfying ending.   I won't give up on Michael Connelley -- books he wrote since Chasing the Dime were better, including one that moved into the courtroom.   However, I will no longer assume that his name on the dustjacket insures a great read.    
 My family and I range in age from 12-45 and are a huge fans of the show.  The DVD game was very disappointing.  The scenes were  choppy.  After only one time playing the game, we already had prizes repeating.  There was no way to tell the winner.  You had to keep track of your own winnings, but the prices were not always given.  I would not recommend this game no matter the age 
 First, try to see if you can borrow this book or check it out from the library.  It has some good points, but those are well bracketed by an endless parade of the author's self-gratifying piffle.  I purchased it because at this point in time (mid-April 2007) there are darn few Lightroom books out there.  Hopefully something better will turn up in a few months and I can send this volume to the recycling center.    This book is literary onanism at its extreme.  And while author Kelby may sell a lot of books and have a well oiled machine to present his workshops, he apparently can't make the intellectual distinction between what you would SAY to an audience (perhaps hundreds of people trapped in a large, darkened room -- praying they'll get their money's worth and not drift into sleep) and what you would WRITE in a textbook or guide.  In fact, it almost seems like the text is a transcript of a workshop presentation, with all the sophomoric asides and lame humor that usually manages to keep people awake and marginally focused.  Examples:   -- The entire three-page introductory Q&A is worthless.  You get suckered into it because the assumption is that sooner or later some real information will be passed.  Three pages later you're at the end -- and none the wiser.   -- The beginning of each chapter is a little more subtle:  For one or a few sentences you almost feel like he's going to address a topic...And then it's back to the drivel.  The intro to Chapter Eight (Printing) is especially insulting, implying that a referenced individual is regular user and purveyor of controlled substances.  Bad enough the Mr. Kelby believes this passes for humor, but don't foist that off on us, please.   -- There are numerous parenthetical remarks in the step-by-step descriptions.  Some are used to clarify a point.  Good.  Some are used to identify the difference between Mac and Windows commands.  Good in concept, but those could have been better presented by effective use of conventions in the text.  The third category can only be described as stupid comments.  The problem is that the good use of parenthetical comments gets diluted by the other two uses.  (See how to deal with this below.)   -- Based on the heavy-handed way that Mr. Kelby touts Nikon and LaCie, my guess is that he doesn't buy his own equipment.   (And I shoot Nikon, BTW.)  If you decide that you really need this book you can improve things a little.  For large sections of text I recommend a black Sharpie pen with the ULTRA fine point.  You can line out hundreds and hundreds of works with no detrimental effects.  This includes all three pages of the introductory Q&A (if you decided not to just rip those pages out) and every word of the intro section to every chapter.  The ultra fine Sharpie won't bleed through (if you keep it moving) and won't smear.  For those shorter sections of drivel that pollute the rest of the book, I recommend one of those tape type Wite-Out pens (such as the BIC Exact Liner).  It takes a little practice and a firm surface, but you'd be amazed how much useless junk Mr. Kelby manages to get onto some pages -- and that you can easily cover up.  This book was apparently rushed to publication.  Just in my skimming of the book I encountered "The bottom line is white balance is a creative decision..." in the last step on page 133.  In the last step of page 135 we find "The bottom line is white balance is a creative decision..."  Maybe this wouldn't stand out in a lecture, but when you read it in a book you take a start and wonder if you mis-turned the pages.  There is no glossary, and no illustrations of the filing conventions unique to Lightroom. 
 Once again Baby Einstein has a great idea and misses the opportunity to make something both fun and truly educational. The visual quality of this DVD is beautiful, and my son likes the puppets. My problem is that whoever designed the concept development did not have a solid understanding of how children learn language. This is a major flaw with many of their DVDs made for children over 9 months old. This DVD has a loose structure which is meant to help a child develop concepts of various forms of waters--rivers, oceans etc, but the makers failed to align images, words, and puppet shows in such a fashion as would allow someone who had no experience with these things to develop a working understanding of what features make a river a river, or an ocean an ocean. Many of the images selected seem to have almost nothing to do with the chosen theme of a segment, or are related in such a way that only an adult or older child who already has a working understanding of the topic would understand. Same goes for the puppet shows. Some are wonderful, but others involve humor or situations that are far out of the realm of a pre-verbal babys experience. I wish Baby Einstein would bring in psychologists or educators when they design their DVDs as they did with Numbers Nursery. 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 I didn't really care for this toy and felt it wasn't really represented properly in its description.  My grandaughter found it boring 
 I work as an editor on high-end projects (mostly commercials and music video's with a couple of well regarded concert DVD's and award winning short film work to my credit) and I have to say that the editing on this disc (and the previous 2, to a lesser extent) demonstrates a real lack of sensitivity to the material.  There is an epic quality to U2 in concert. Each song is its own experience... its own mini event; and instead of letting the power of that experience unfold naturally and organically... letting the music/performance tell its own story (and what a story it is!) the editing imposes itself on the music and the performance(s) and the effect is that you are taken out of (or at least not fully drawn into) the marvelous natural flow of power that is U2 live.  All 3 of these DVD's are worth having simply because the band's brilliance in concert mostly transcends the poor editing but these discs COULD have been truly amazing documentations of almost religious experiences had the director/editor gotten out of their own way and really understood and felt into the event(s).  What a shame 
  Bands don't need to be different for the sake of being different, but I prefer when each CD a band creates is a separate entity from the ones that have come before them. X&Y is basically a clone of RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD but lacking the few essential differences that would make this something other than a tired retread. The same sound, the ethereal production, but now it's wearing thin because you sit there and say "Haven't we heard this before?" I don't really dislike the sound, but X&Y is just pleasant background noise. Here's hoping the next time out the band puts a little edge on their music. 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 I was attracted to the Thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear, and because Thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day.  The product indeed has a clever-seeming design, and it is well manufactured.    But ultimately, this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that FEELS to me like it needs to be stretched. (I.e., the area along the sole of my foot that I can feel stretching out in the mornings when, before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it, I press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel; that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed.)  The velcro fastenings are indeed secure, but the product's sock-like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they'll go; as a result, what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down.  Worse, the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just doesn't create the proper stretch; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy.  I'm going to try a rigid split, which may be less comfortable.  But I believe that I need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle, which the Thermoskin product doesn't.  And I'd rather incur some discomfort, if it will actually help me get well, than continue to use this not too uncomfortable (but ineffective) product from Thermoskin.    Perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than I have had; and I have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what I've read on the internet, so consider this to be very much a layman's review.  I've been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement, and I can't compare this product to others that I hope might be more effective.    But I was very disappointed in this product, and regret having spent the money for it 
 Like I've said in some of my eariler reviews, sometimes this is just no fun at all. Whilst it's always funny to rip into, say, Pop Idol or something, here it's just... sad.  The Ultimate series of Marvel comics was a potentially awful idea done to surprisingly awesome effect. Taking the well worn ideas and characters from the Marvel Universe, going straight back to square one and re-imagining the origins and original characters could well have blown up in the writers faces. But not so. The writing in some of these books is simply superb, and sometimes makes the impossible seem scarily possible. Ultimate Spider-Man, of course, is a constant delight, with top class banter, witty one-liners and some brutal action (with the exception of the heartbreakingly average Venom and Carnage re-do's), and then there's the Ultimates (the Avengers) and... oooh, oodles more. Like I said - top idea.  But not here. Again, the characters are made teenagers, which is fine for, say, Spidey, who WAS a teenager in the first place, but a sixteen/seventeen year old Ben Grimm just doesn't cut it. Also, the script lacks major bite. After what we've seen with Spidey et al, we really do need something special to warrant another spin on the Marvel franchise (especially for its oldest family) and there's nothing here that excites or, crucially, convinces. In short, it just makes you pine for the original books.  The most galling thing though, is the sham that is Dr Doom (or, I'm sorry, Dr Damme). Change what you like from the original comics guys; the crummy banter, some dodgy storylines, but DO NOT REPLACE the original character names. So, what, a guy called Victor Von Doom isn't realistic, but having a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY design and build the Fantasti-Car, an interdimensional rocket ship, is??  As the Human Torch himself said, "dude.. that's Fantasti-crappy."  I won't be buying THIS junk anymore.  The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.u 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 if you don't believe try doing the exercise on page 316, you won't get past step 4. It's like they left out a few steps to the exercise 
 Really? Wow. So, players in real football go through other players torso's? They skate and glide around the field at 40MPH without moving their legs? WR's change direction on one foot, pivot, glide and elude tackles? Uh, ok.  Anyone who plays this game on the All-madden level will notice right away that this is the furthest thing from a realistic football game. What are the nerds at EA thinking? Do they ENJOY making a game who's AI constantly cheats? I love how they tout games that "give the user more control" when the user has very LITTLE CONTROL over anything that goes on in the game. I don't control if I catch it or drop it, or intercept it, or if my line blocks, of if my DB's cover their assignment...none of it. The COMPUTER makes my line miss blocks or not block at all...drop easy picks...drop easy catches, etc. And why, oh why, are DT's and LB's faster than my fastest WR? Is THAT realistic? The AI is terrible. It blatantly and UNrealistically cheats.  Terrible game. Just stop making these games if this is your final product 
 I was expecting to learn some of the "lingo" of NASCAR.  That was the main reason for buying the book.  I enjoyed the description, etc. of the race tracks.  Did not like "where to go" or the scrapbook.  I thought it would explain a little more about actual racing and race cars, etc.  Good thing I didn't spend too much on the book 
 This is a rehash of Charles Tart, Wayne Dyer, and a host of others. Nothing at all new.  What is new is that someone can put out something the length of an article and call it a book.  And charge for the price of a book.  Just for the heck of it I let a friend read it, who hasn't read this stuff before and NO it did not turn her world inside out.  If you have never heard this stuff before it  is way to short to convince you.  If you have read it before, no need to read it again.  Many other people have said it better 
 And I do mean REALLY STUPID. Like a previous reviewer, I bought this to keep me occupied on a long flight. When, within the first 20 or so pages, the author introduces two made-up gimmicks that are central to the plot, I knew I was in trouble. First up is a liquid nuclear explosive. Yeah, right. Anyone who even slept through high school physics would know that's a crock. Then there is the super oxygen carrying blood transfusion that gets the major bad guy through an execution. In a science fiction story, the spare use of such gimmicks might be ok. But here the author uses them because he just isn't bright enough to come up with a good story otherwise.     Had I been on a train trip, this book would have gone right out the train window. However, they frown on opening windows on airplanes so I just left it on the plane. I probably should have taken it off with me and tossed it in the trash to save the next passanger in my seat from having to deal with this 
 I'm so glad we didn't buy a subscription to National Geographic Kids magazine without checking it out at the news stand first! It truly seemed like there were more pages of ads than of actual CONTENT in this magazine.  If you're looking for a good kids' magazine about nature & wildlife, try one of the National Wildlife Federation's excellent publications. My kids enjoy Your Big Backyard (for ages 3-7) and Ranger Rick (for kids 7 & up), both of which are available through Amazon.com or [...]  Kids Discover magazine (for 6-12 year olds) is another favorite with my children (and me) and contains great science & social studies articles without the commercials of NG Kids. You can subscribe through Amazon or [... 
 Although I "listened" to this book on tape, I too was lulled into thinking this is like Jon Kraukauer's "Into Thin Air" -- hardly. It is interesting and at first I didn't realize it was a true story. Balf's book does give a bit of a behind-the-scenes glance at how a trek like this is set up & the importance of the personalities of the people undergoing the trek....but I agree with previous reviewers that this was no page-turner (or let's put it this way, I wasn't sitting in my garage, after coming home from my commute, to stay listening to the tape). If you are a kayaker, maybe this is for you - having trekked in Nepal, I found some of the countryside info of interest, but can't really recommend this book 
 This is a good fictional book. The problem is that the author believes it  to be real. I think she watches too much tv 
 Ho Ho Ho!! My 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it. He's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it. We've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work. The only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again (if you know how to turn the sound off, let me know. I'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire).  Do not buy this toy. You'll be very disappointed in it. 
 Has everyone gone insane?  As an English teacher who has taught this novel for a couple years, I was looking for a little something more faithful to the novel than the original version. Hah!  This piece of trash is the worst version of a classic novel I've seen in 20 years of teaching. There were approximately three moments in the movie that actually had to do with the text, and I'm sure that was purely accidental. The monster is a gangster, Frankenstein looks like one of the Spartans in The 300, Elizabeth is a deranged emo, and Clerval has been relegated to to role of idiotic womanizer. When the credits rolled at the end and I saw that Branagh had directed this film (he who created the most watchable, beautiful, and textually accurate version of Hamlet ever), I thought I may as well burn myself on a funeral pyre (one of the few textually accurate details in this horror of a film).  Here's the deal - don't waste your time. Read the book. Byron and Shelley were right - Mary had somehting going with this story - too bad Branagh forgot to read it 
 I could not watch all it because one disc will not play.  What I could watch of the series, I would rate a 5 star 
 Speaking as someone with a degreee in math, plus some graduate work, I found this book frustrating and disappointing.  I wanted to fill in some historical perspective to all the math I had learned, but I was little  illuminated by this book.  While the author clearly knows a lot about math,  his writing is vague, poorly organized, and unfocused.  He answered few of  my questions and does not present a coherent picture of his topic.  Rather  than this book, I recommend Morris Kline "Mathematical Thought from  Ancient to Modern Times", which is infinitely better 
 I have read a lot of books on real estate investing. There are a few good ones out there that give real detailed, REAListic advice. This is not one of them.  It is not very specific and I did not find it to live up to it's title of being a "step-by-step guide".  There is not much substance to the book and can't say I learned anything by reading it. I'm a beginning investor with only a few years of experience, and the book was below my knowledge level.  The author may be experienced and successful, but not everyone is an expert at conveying a message. I do not recommend this book 
 the typical self proclaimed china hand writing books catered to the western audience with typical stories everyone hears if you are in the investing biz.  no added value except to "reveal" to the world what had happened to him or her.  do these writers trully understand china?; same question to be posed to the thousands of current and potential investors into china.  and can they offer insights that are practical, realistic and offers a true fact of what is happening daily on the ground?  i seriously doubt any writer can offer this in respect to china because china is a story of limitless permutations.  there is only one commonality in china, which is its damn hard to get it right, because there is no right or wrong in this environment.  so how does anyone who wants to know how to operate in this environment learn?  i beg to differ, but its not gonna be thru a book written by the gangs of so called "china hands" out there.  these books are like the ones that came out supporting the great hype about the "new ecnomony" when the heat was scorching white.  opportunistic but offers little value.  i'll only buy the soft cover versions of these type of books or reading it as borrowed material. there is absolutely nothing valuable in this type of undertaking other than entertaining one on a slow afternoon. the author doesn't trully understand the reasons why things and events like those that transpired while he was ther in the early 90s, he doesn't understand the deep down psychic of the chinese person that he is dealing with.  chinese as a society is very complicated and extremely difficult to "read", and with the thousands of years of upheavals and sufferings of the masses, a twisted sense of whats right or wrong flows thru to today's society.  understand the meaning of "middle kingdom" and the world will have a starting point on why things are done the way they are today.  understand why "putonghua" has to be implemented  to bring all the different sects of chinese together is also another start.  i have yet to read any of this and a hundred other basic seeds of discontent that creates the china it is of today and why it behaves the way it does.  i doubt that anyone will be able to put it in on paper with  a certain thoroughness as it will create lots of uneasiness and tensions that has been around for 5000 years.  chinese will not accept a book on this and the western reader will have difficulty fathoming the gist and hidden weight behind each nuance.  
 The recipes are mostly plagiarized and cleverly edited  by this author (unfortunately this happens frequently with cookbook authors).    Many of the dishes bear no relationship to the reality of the dish...with ingredients left out and often in the wrong proportions.  Non Greek cooks may think that this book beats all, but it is clearly a mediocre presentation of Greek cooking at best.  For an excellent and truly knowledgable Greek cookbook try The Ultimate Greek Cookbook, by Vangelis Driskas (Patakis Publishers)  
 This book is the centerpiece of a very scary and disturbing legal altercation in which the publisher, CRC Press LLC, basically tried to strong-arm Eric W. Weisstein into gaining complete control over the material on his mathworld website, after he signed a contract for them to publish this book, which is essentially a snapshot of the material.  I would urge everyone to show personal support for Eric W. Weisstein in whatever way possible--donations are a great idea.  However, by buying this book you are supporting a company that is greedy and downright creepy.  You're also encouraging other companies to do the same.  We need to show the publishing industry that greed does not pay--and one great way of doing that is by not buying this book 
 This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting by everyone in this movie sucks, and they all looked pathetic! The aircraft is hijacked and landed into the small town's non-commercial airport, the hijackers have just dropped dead bodies from the plane and asking for fuel or else they will kill more people, and the chief officer of sheriff dept. reacts by asking the old lady at the ATC tower "Can you fix me that coffee of yours?" ?? I mean the direction in this movie is best example of how bad a direction can be. As rightly pointed by one of the reviewers (P. Sullivan) here, another stupid example is that old lady passenger doing woo-hoo after the plane was landed with dead people everywhere. Again, don't expect anything on any front of direction, acting, scripts, storyline, and dialogues.   If you like movies based on aircrafts/actions, then watch Executive Decision, a lot better than this. I bought this DVD when it was available for $14.99, and I always felt that I wasted those few bucks. A waste of time and money!  
 Terrible movie... I really like Denzel Washington as an actor but in this movie it was very dissapointing... he is much better when he plays to be a good person that fights for justice and what is right 
 I really can't understand how a person can't include the title track. Well not exactly the title track, but when it was first released the album in the U.S. they changed the album title from A Quick One to Happy Jack. But anyways, it's outrageous not to include the original recording of Happy Jack. It's like not including Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water on the album Bridge Over Troubled Water. It's like not including Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin' on the album The Times They Are A-Changin'. It's like not including the Beatle's Magical Mystery Tour on the album Magical Mystery Tour. I think I made my point. It's a shame. I suggest downloading the tracks that were on the original album from iTunes to make your own A Quick One/Happy Jack. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 I should have read the subtitle closer - *HOW* to stop wasting our brightest young minds.  If there was any indication of *WHY* to stop wasting bright minds, I slept right through it.  If noone understands *WHY*, there's no reason to care about *HOW* 
 I bought this new TV to go with my new house/tv unit/sofa, etc. This was the last item to arrive on my shopping list for the new house. Was excited to receive it. However, after the cable guy came to install cable, TV starteded to act up. First 15min of viewing was fine with very crisp pictures. After 15min, HD channels started to freeze up. So I switched to SD channels, all were fine initially. However, after another 15min or so, similar thing started happening. We first saw lines/waves showing on screen, then picture started to freeze.  At first we thought it was the cable box that was bad. We then tried 2nd cable box; same problem persists. We tried using different component cables, different inputs, hooking up coaxial directly to tv rather than the cable box. Same thing. At last we tried the dvd player, lines/waves also start appearing. At this point, we came to the conclusion that the TV could be defective.  [...]  Anyway, to make the story short, I am finally able to return the TV to amazon for a refund. Aside from the email that I received from their specialty dept, I am pleased with amazon's customer service.   And with Samsung, I am sort of afraid to give it another try.. 
 This book is an in-depth exploration of the vast possibilities available to the person who wants the ultimate garden gadget: the home computer.  But it doesn't actually let you DO anything.  It tells you the difference between hardware and software, how to buy a computer, what the parts of a computer are (ie, keyboard, mouse, modem), what an operating system is, what a spreadsheet is, the questions to ask when looking for software, and a lot of other stuff.  It introduces the www on page 86.  The included CD-ROM contains 60 shareware and freeware programs that do not allow you to print or save whatever you may design, and in some cases only allow you to explore the possibilities of design on a set imaginary property, not your own.  You can get a decent feel for a broad range of software options without buying 60 different programs, but if you are already reading this and have heard of Google, it is a waste of [$$$] (cover price) and 95 cubic inches of paper.  A great gift for the recently retired gardner with some money and land and no idea how to use a computer 
 Stupefying and moronic is the most apt description of this waste of celluloid. Though made during the Cold War, its portrayal of Russian people is unfairly mean-spirited and in a review I read elsewhere, it was described as xenophopic. I would go so far as to say it is propagandistic. Its the kind of film which will appeal to today's dumbed-down American who thinks he's a little more special than everyone else in the world and that he has the right to blow up foreign villages and otherwise disregard laws and civil behavior. The idiotic characters justly deserved the punishment they received in this pathetic film 
 You got Tupac Shakur (Gridlock'd, Bullet) in his last movie before his death, which he shows some very good acting skills might I say and then on the other side you got a chubby and overly miscast James Belushi (Destiny Turns On The Radio, The Florentine) sprouting a top hat threw the movie. These 2 cops sell cocaine to dealers, kill them and then throw away the drugs but they make a mistake when they kill a DEA Agent instead of a dealer. Things spiral down from there in this edgy urbanesque action thriller. Not much when the story is hammy. Also starring Dennis Quaid (Frequency, The Day After Tomorrow), Lela Rochon (The Big Hit, Waiting To Exhale), David Paymer (Quiz Show, Payback), James Earl Jones (Field Of Dreams, Empire Strikes Back), Gary Cole (A Simple Plan, Office Space) and Wendy Crewson (Air Force One) 
 "Hunting Warbirds" primarily relates the story of the location and extraction of an RB-29 lost in Greenland in 1947.  As a story about modern archaeology it's fairly interesting, as a story about warbirds and collectors, it's superficial.  Other reviewers have clearly outlined the rambling nature of the prose: we go from Greenland, to the States for an interview with a "unique" collector (that doesn't really shed insight into Warbird Enthusiasts, except to say that some are obsessed. Anyone's who's been to a gaming or Star Trek convention can observe the same behaviors in the minority of attendees), back to Greenland.   But as I said above, "Who's the audience here?"  One of the concepts I was taught in my undergrad days was to write to the knowledge base of the target audience.  Mr Hoffman, seems to have ignored this advice in this work.  His NUMEROUS inaccuracies regarding WW2 aircraft, and aviation are enough to put off aviation enthusiasts, (the logical target audience) while the narrow scope of the book would discourage general readers.  The inaccuracies themselves always leave that "what else is missing, misquoted or just plain wrong here?" notion in the back of your mind.  This is frankly surprising since his resume includes "Air & Space" and "Smithsonian" magazines.   Finally, a better book would have at least summarized the efforts in Finland, Germany, and Russia to recover some of their warbirds from WW2.  Operations that in ethnocentric America, don't get their deserved attention. If you are an aviation or WW2 aircraft enthusiast, you already know this story-the book offers no addtional insight-certainly none into WW2 salvage as a whole.  If you have a slight interest in the subject matter, the documentaries about the salvage operation are a better medium 
 I am a fan of many of John Barnes works.  One of my favorites, Candle, is set in the same near future world of mayhem ruled by computer viruses that have jumped to the human brain.  The concept is mind blowing and more than a bit eeire.  But where Candle succeeded, I think that KC has failed. Set in our near future, the hero begins a spree of violence that extends 160 years into the future. Killing and raping and killing and raping and killing and raping ad infinitum--you get the point. To give you a flavor for the book, I'll quote: "Not really esthetic or special, but still there was something about doing them all in an hour, in one mass hanging, chick after chick hoisted kicking into the air, all of them naked, the ones yet to be done cowering in the corner, bruised, bloody, crying for their mothers--I still got stiff thinking about it." I'm not typically one to be squeamish about a little (or a lot of) violence to advance the plot line.  What I do object to is the use of violence as the plot line.  I realize that writing is difficult, and is more art than science, but this seems to be taking the easy way out.  I only wish that JB had spent the extra time to fully explore the plot.  Hopefully he'll write more about this fascinating world in a more accessible manner 
 I've read quite a bit of Zen literature, including translations of the original sutras, koans, etc. but I'm most disappointed in this tape. The tape, and I assume the book, has the quality of a harangue, with the reader constantly admonishing the listener.  Much of the tape has the form, . . ."and if you don't understand this, you will never understand anything about Zen."  After a while, it grows tiring.  Buddha didn't phrase his lectures as cryptic, snide criticisms of his audiences capacity for enlightenment, and that's how this tape comes across. In contrast, listen to "The Teachings of Zen: Master Dogen" for a deep and empathic description of Zen philosophy 
 The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!"  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.    A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clichï¿½.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.    Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.  Enough said there.  My advice, watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.' 
 I picked this book up at a dollar store so I guess I got my moneys worth . this book gives very little info compared to it's size. It does have some useful info on the morning star ratings and Bata.  For me it seems to give a lot of info  what people do wrong but not How to do it right. 
 The lead actors in this movie (Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger)were pretty flat and unconvincing, namely in the lines where they are trying to sound empathetic and concerned. The paper mache cow he was beating seemed pretty unconvincing, too. The movie is, simply enough, about a dual-personality character who has conflict with himself, and that's the most of it. More could have been done with it. More, and better 
 I was looking forward to reading this book but it is taking a month to reach me. It was shipped on February 8. It is not March 7 and no book.  I am not a happy camper 
 one of the most powerful and disturbing movies i have ever seen.  thank god for the canadians.  i doubt this could have been made in america.  but it was disturbing.  i grew to literally hate some of the people in thia movie and had to shake off what i felt when they found it was time to pay the piper.  this should be required watching for all straight people.  maybe then they would figure out that pediphiles are not gay.  there is a vast difference between gay males and pedophiles.  anyway, i can not recommend this movie strongly enough.  the acting and the group of people  who directed and produced this movie were very brave in doing so.  this is a taboo subject in the u.s.  once again, thanks to the canadians and the european's who DO make this type of movie.   gary in az 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 The concept of this film is downright brilliant--a maze of betrayal and corruption and kidnapping-gone-wrong...or did it? It's too bad that the script and/or the editing is so sloppy and choppy that I frequently found myself wincing at such poor filmmaking. The gratuitous sex might be a turn-on for some (it wasn't for me), but the only really worthwhile aspects of this movie are the idea itself and the actors, who have gifted this writer/director with far better performances than he deserves. If you're a fan of any of the actors, you might watch it if you have nothing better to do. Otherwise, skip it 
 Love the Riedel glasses and had ordered them in the past from Amazon. Unfortunately, the Amazon shipping department seems to have difficulty packing delicate items: The first shipment included a couple of heavy books which shifted during mailing and broke the glasses. The replacement box had the glasses jammed against one corner with air packing around three sides. Those arrived broken, also. Guess we'll purchase the glasses at a wine shop! Love Amazon and this is the first time we've had a shipping problem with you! 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 I'm really not sure what they were going for with this movie, but they never achieved it!! If it's hentai or anime you are looking for this is NOT it!! There really is no plot or point to this movie. This is absolutlly the WORST movie I have ever seen! 
 Lamberto Bava's "Demons 2" just doesn't quite live up to the classic status of the original. The quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way !THE GORE IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THESE KIND OF CULT FILMS! "Demons 2" lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original "Demons" such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet! While not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations,especially considering the two maestro's who held the reins (Argento & Bava!) 
 Gloom and doom with a left wing slant.  Peak oil is real but this guy is extrapolating many trends to arrive at his version of a gloomy future.  The sky is falling, the sky is falling 
 I have seen several films about Van Gogh, all which were fascinating.  In each Van Gogh was a character that was portrayed in a manner that was human and who had ideas and humanity as well as a need to do art.  By contrast, Harris' Pollock lacked any humanity, except for one scene where he takes a dog to a vet.  And Pollock didn't seem to be someone who thought about life at all.  He hardly cared about anyone and in the whole movie connected with no one with the exception of his wife, and that was far more a practical relationship than a love relationship.  His wife Lee was portrayed as a generally uninteresting person as well.  I was not drawn in by the film at all by any of the main characters.  Pollock's gift to the world was his art; who he was and the life he lived were not worth making a movie of if this is the best the story can be told in film.  
 I loved this magazine in 1995, until a few years ago.  They have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads.  No new information.  Glossy pics of models with bright red lips.  What is about health here?  Get Life Extension magazine and Alternative Medicine Magazine.  They've changed too over the last few years, but still a far sight better than this one 
 I am a big fan of Emily Dickinson, I love her poetry, but this edition is thoroughly rotten.  It is not Emily Dickinson's poetry, but the edited version of her poetry, significantly changed by the same editor who rejected Dickinson's poems while she was alive.  This edition is changed so much from the original poems that most of Dickinson's meaning is lost.  If you want to read what Emily Dickinson really wrote, I reccomed the complete poetry of Emily Dickinson edited by Thomas H. Johnson, it is the complete and original poetry of Dickinson 
 After 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please. 
  	The author of A Northern Light is Jennifer Donnelly.  She resides in Brooklyn, N.Y, with her husband and daughter as well as two greyhounds.  Other works by  the author  include Humble Pie and The Tea Rose.  A Northern Light was the winner of The Carnegie Medal, The Los Angeles Times Prize and A Michael L. Printz Award Honor Book.   	The intended purpose of this book was to address many issues that young people face growing up.  The main character, Mattie Gokey, has to go through many hardships and make many adult decisions in this novel.  Mattie lives with her Pa and younger sisters.  Other characters that play a large role in this book are Weaver, Royal, Minnie, Miss Wilcox and Grace Brown.  A murder takes place in this book that was based upon real events.  Even though the murder was an actual event, the characters are made up to help it come clearer to readers.  Grace Brown's body is found in the lake after she takes a boat ride.   She gives Mattie a bundle of letters to burn but when she is found dead, instead of burning them, Mattie begins to read them and discovers many important aspects of the murder.  Donnelly skips back and forth from past to present and takes us through part of Mattie's life.  She also adds alot of advanced vocabulary for Mattie's words of the day.  She also uses language of the time period to make the story  come to life better.   	Although this novel received many awards of excellence and I'm sure alot of people would greatly enjoy  reading it, I was not one of them.  At the beginning, I thought it was going to be a very exciting murder mystery, but was disappointed to discover that the murder played only a small part in the whole novel.  I did find it very interesting though that it was actually based on a real murder.  I would probably not recommend this book for someone who is looking for a murder mystery because the murder only plays a small part in the novel.  Also, I think the author could have labeled the chapters a little more clearly because it got a little confusing with all the switching back and forth between past and present.   	I would say the intended audience would be young adults and most likely just females.  It contained some adult content, such as some profanity, as well as some sexual content.  Boys would probably not enjoy this novel because it is, in some aspects, a love story.  There's "sparking" and affairs and dirty older men at the hotel.  A younger person would not understand or want to read something that involves such material.   	In conclusion, A Northern Light was not one of my  favorite books that I've ever read.  The audience range is very  small and also based upon gender.  It is a well written novel, it just doesn't spark alot of interest in many people.  It went into to much detail at some parts and not enough for other parts.  I think she should have made the murder a more important part of the novel because it would have made it much more exciting.  
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 This book needs a revision and bad.  This book was first published in 1992 and was first revised....never.  There are a few interesting techniques in this book but they all seem a little outdated.  There is even a section with old early 90's slang.  Read this book for it's humor but do not take it seriousl 
 I was disappointed with the book. I expected a book that would describe how to succeed in commercial real estate for someone wanting to buy and lease out commerical properties. This book hardly touched on the topics I wanted to learn about, such as what makes a property a good investment, how to do due diligence on a property when considering it for purchase, tips on finding a good investment and why it's so hard, pros and cons of development vs buying an existing building, etc. I would have appreciated if the front cover would have made the target audience clearer. Read the table of contents carefully before making the assumption I did! 
 I read all the reviews where everyone said this movie was so hilarious. So I gambled and bought it. Man, this movie really stunk. I mean it's like it could have been funny, but none of the re-dubbing was very funny at all. I watched this movie with some good expectations, but as it droned on and on, it slowly became apparent to me that no laughs were coming. In fact, as I kept watching it I kept thinking to myself, "Geez, even I could dub funnier dialogue into the movie than THIS!"  Don't get me wrong; dubbing over a corny Japanese spy movie definitely sounds like it would be very funny. It's an idea that has the potential to be VERY funny. It just wasn't done very well here. Don't expect many laughs from this movie. For most of the movie, no one is even talking at all! You're just watching a bad not-funny movie. But if that's what you like, then by all means, buy it.  P.S. By the way, this movie has it's occasional sexually interesting scenes. But you don't ever get to see anything. They've edited-out anything that might have been worth seeing. So not only is it NOT funny, but where the original movie would have turned you on, you are denied that as well. A nitpick to be sure, but it didn't make me like this movie any better.   P.S. #2. If you want to go watch something funny, watch "This is Spinal Tap." That movie is truly hilarious. It does not disappoint. It doesn't have anything to do with Woody Allen, but it will wash the bad taste out of your mouth that "What's Up Tiger Lily" is guaranteed to leave you with 
 i didnt like clue chronicles i sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out, i got so far and couldnt get any further. this was a waste of my money, if i could sell it i would, i like the regular clue better, that is why i bought this i thought it was something like the old one, when i seen it wasnt, i thought this might be fun, but as i was playing it i hated it more and more. i have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and i end up in the same spot and cant get no where else. i hate i 
 I know she must have meant well, but Flook inserts herself into the narrative for no discernable purpose -- she strains to write cool but it comes off as annoying. There's a lot of repetition. And then they arrest someone who is not even in the book and you think, why did I waste my time reading this?  If she just didn't try so hard -- you get the feeling that she kept a thesarus close by the entire time she was writing so she could find a whizzy turn of phrase to impress us but it just didn't work. Her writing is too self conscious 
 A big help to me in my game . The biggest help i got from another of rotellas books directly with putting and as a result i have never seen so many birdies in a round due directly to the said two books 
 I'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with.  However, my public library has a limited selection of audio books, so I take what I can get.  I am a voracious reader, and I listen to audios to get more "reading" in, as you can listen and do other things.  I much prefer the Lillian Jackson Braun "cat" books, at least there is some humor, and I like the "mystery" part of these books better than Deaver's.  Sorry to all the Deaver fan's out there...I HAVE enjoyed a few of his books, but I get tired of the "same ole-same ole" 
 This diet book is a waste of money. If I would go on this diet,  I would starve.  It is so restrictive that I would very soon be bored with the foods allowed.  I want to lose weight but I don't think I would be able to stick to this restrictive a plan.  There seems to be some inconsistencies in the book.  Recipes include things he says earlier in the book are no-nos.  So are they ok or not?  Don't waste the money 
 James A. Michener built a writing career on impeccable research of a subject and writing as if he did not have a clue about editing. It seemed as if Michener attempted to outdo himself in the number of words he produced for each subsequent book.  It appears as if Michener could not pull himself away from his novelized form of history while penning this work on the Kent State shootings. There is one main character that is pure fiction, the "drifter." That character - as stated by Michener when he got caught in his web of make-believe after the book was published - is an alleged composite figure.   In actuality, he may be based on a real-life male who was a government informant, hired to infiltrate organizations and then trumping up "facts" to prove they were prepared to unleash violent acts against individuals and institutions.  But people as real as Homer Simpson and scenes that may have been built better in the back lot of a movie studio did not prevent Michener from defending the book. But a writer does not report news by penning a great lie.  Michener refused to let facts get in the way of his storytelling. If nothing else, this book is a great example on how myth becomes reality & how an author can get onto the fast track for a Presidential Medal of Freedom 
 Conservatives will probably dislike it.  Liberals will find it a good, fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole.  I'm a liberal, so it was fun for me.  But have you noticed how the word "community" is becoming the new flashword among liberals?  "We are all in this together," says Mario, so we had better take care of ourselves.  Like Hillary Clinton's "It Takes a Village."  The use of "community" is like the use of "opportunity" by the conservatives.  Both are code words for points of view that, taken to their extremes, can be far more detrimental than helpful.  Americans ultimately prefer the middle.  Just remember that, folks, and no one will get hurt 
 The key in the book is How to Find your Mission in Life, well after reading this thing several times, I found it as unhelpful as the first read.  Quite honestly it is full of feel good platitudes, which are not only Christian, and no roadmap.  If you really want to find your mission perhaps try the other book, Parachute, the 2007 edition is superb 
 I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet.  After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be "banned from the universe" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not "Playboy" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY. 
 I have discovered that Mr. Byock's translation is regrettably bland.  It appears that he translates word-for-word, which gives the English prose a clumsy, "summarizing" kind of a feel.  The translation lacks a beautiful, flowing quality that might emerged had he tried to portray the spirit of the work through his own personal, subjective experience.  Said again, he should have taken personal "ownership" of the story and written it in modern English according to his own inner feeling -- richly imagining the events and meaning, and then writing a faithful, but new story.  Instead, he rather logically translates word-for-word, with seemingly little care for the poetic quality of the tale.  Thus the reading is bulky and unimaginative.   I believe that portraying one's own inner experience of a story is more "valid" than a scientifically-accurate rendering of it.  Although the text is clear, to a fault, I was disappointed with it.  I recommend a different translation. 
 As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out.  With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings.  This cd got stale fast.  Seems to be geared to the tween crowd.  I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past 
 Well, before buying this I had never even heard of bright eyes.  Just so you know my background, I generally dislike indie and Emo.  I usually listen to hardcore and Screamo.  But for some reason I became interested in this band.  (or person) Someone compared a CD of their's to A Death Cab CD.  Me being a pretty big Death Cab fan, I decided to go out and buy this EP to see if I liked this band at all.  This review is the result of that listen.  The EP opens up with the slow acoustic guitar picks of "a line allows prgress"...  A few seconds into the song I am greeted with with drums and an organ.  This song sounds like a slower Cursive song.  The guy's voice sounds decent.  I guess the vocal effects he uses are for emotional purposes.  Overall this is a pretty decent song.  It reminds me of hotel california.  Next in line comes one of my favorite tracks on here:  "a perfect sonnet".  I don't know if it's the simple guitar stum or the sense that his voice is going to explode any moment.  Seriously, the whole song I was thinking that everything was about to fall apart...but it didn't.  He keeps going and going.  It must be his voice that creates this mood.  This was also the point of the CD where I realized that it was a bit more than music I was listening to.  Bright eyes will make you feel moods that other music can't.  It's got a unique brand of emotion that is new to me.  It's too bad this song ends so quickly.  As I press on to: "on my way to work" I begin to get the feel for the CD.  He's almost whispering on this track.  There's an odd sounding guitar picking and a country sounding synthesizer.  Quite frankly, I hate this song.  It sounds like an offkey country ballad...  Who wants that?  The next two tracks are more or less the same feel.  A new arrangement provides better quality music than the craptastic on my way to work, but doesn't reach the level of A perfect sonnet.  Finally, the EP is ended with the techno atmospheric: Neely o hara...  I don't know what to say.  It's meaningless.  I don't see how you can like this.  It's just pointless.  Overall this is a half and half EP.  The first two tracks are good...  But the rest of the CD falls between failing and decent.  If Bright Eyes good churn out more tracks like a perfect sonnet, this band would get at least a 4 star.  Sadly thats not the case.  So I don't recommend this for anyone other than the really dedicated fans.  Perhaps the other CD's are better 
 this is a very colorful book, full of interesting facts. my 10 yr old grandson, has 3 other ripley books and is alway pulling them out and reading them. if you love the show, you will indeed love these books. they are price just right. c 
 The last two Kovels' I purchased were the 1996 and 1998 editions. The 2007 edition in no way compares to the "older" ones; information is not as easy to find, is "scattered," and not as meaningful. The older editions seemed more comprehensive and informative, in a similar-sized book 
 Even if one is sympathetic to Groothuis's broad concern, one can't help but be disappointed with this text. This book is a bad regurgitation of other bad and reductive non-readings of `pomo'. Groothuis depends way too highly on secondary (and sometimes tertiary) sources. It escapes me how a former reviewer could call this work `scholarly.' I suppose if one considers Logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the Faith' rhetoric and aura (which hovers over every page), then this could be called `scholarly.'   The big problem I found is that even when Groothuis offers defensible criticisms, his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes. For all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth, his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence. He falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality,' representation to presentation, the role of language, and so forth. No doubt God comes to save the day with all these problems, yet on the very justificatory terms Groothuis advocates for, God escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility. In other words, God becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves' Groothuis's truth from the skeptic. The problem, however, is that Groothuis wants truth to be absolute, universal, and accessible to all, yet he is dependent on a moment (i.e. faith) which, by definition, retains a trace of contingency or `objective' undecidability.    Groothuis's more ethical concerns are where I am more sympathetic, but again, here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers. Groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo' Evangelical's do: uncriticality. Here, philosophy and reflection - whether Modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo, rather than challenging and transforming the status quo. The challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of Christendom.   Jesus did not come to `save' our metaphysical systems, but to redeem us and this world. That redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as Groothuis seems to think. It is madness to the Greek (i.e. the logician) and a stumbling block to the Legalist (i.e. moralistic hypocrites). The task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive. As James tells us, the measure of `true' faith - and here I will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan.' Kerygma without service is dead, a worse lie than any humanism. Perhaps if we began `proving' our faith, that is, manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify. I guess it is much easier to `defend the faith' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced, than to `live the faith': serve the people no one gives a hoot about. After all, in the latter case one cannot fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way.    
 This book felt more like a gossip commentary on the woman who wrote this book and her local mom friends than something that others could learn from.  This book could have been a real help for me but it missed the mark.  The author of this book has infant twins AND and older daughter, as do I.  One of many challenges of the last year has been how to give the babies all that they need emotionally and physically while managing the development and emotional state of my older daughter.  Practical advice was missing -- things like how do you take them all shopping at the grocery store?  While the original message may have been lost in the editing, it seemed like her older daughter was ignored during the babies first year 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 This is another interesting book that could have been a 5 to 10-page brilliant article. Repetitive to the extreme, the authors go on and on and on and on... But I am glad I read this book. There is only one issue I wish was addressed. Being frugal and living below your means is good. After all, there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in a watch or in shoes. However, there MUST be a balance in life. What is the point of having money if it is not to spend? Who needs lead a miserable life only to die with 5 million in net worth? I wish the authors would address this issue, or at least mention that there is a balance and this choice is beyond the scope of their book. Instead, it looks like the "pursuit of wealth" is a constitutional obligation of every citizen 
 Someone gave me this  book when I became pregnant with my  first child  at  age 34.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  This book does absolutely NOTHING to settle the mind of a woman of "advanced maternal age." Get "What to Expect When You're Expecting" instead.  It's gentle and encouraging and most of the info  applies to expectant moms of all ages 
 reasons I wouldn't go with this book:  1. poor pedagogy, i.e., easy examples, but unsolvable problems 2. not necessarily very up-to-date, lacking in innovation, extremely old-fashioned 3. there are surely better written books on Circuits out there    e.g.: Alexander&Sadiku (which is an easy but great read), or Dorf (which is pretty decent 
 I rented the "original" Star Wars first, just to see if it was as bad as everyone says.  Good GOD!  It's horrible!  It looks only slightly better than video tape.  I read a lot of reviews stating that "this is what fans have ask for"...honestly, I didn't ask for this.  Nobody did.  Sure we all want the choice between the original Star Wars and the Special Edition, but I think George is doing nothing but slapping us fans in the face with this release. I despertly wanted the original movies in their original form, but not like this.  I think George is basically trying to get us to admit that his special edition is better....it's not.  The way it was presented on DVD is far superior, but in my opinion, George is taking away part of our childhood with the new stuff.  for example, they remastered Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, but did they ad new characters?  Change the songs to something more "current"?  Digitally enhance Atlanta burning? No....but they did do those transfer justice.  They look great, they sound great, and that makes for fun viewing.  This slop that George is handing us is NOT what we asked for....so George, I say to you...NO!  BAD!  If I had a rolled up newspaper, I smack you in the head with it and rub your nose this pile of....DVD's...to make sure you know better next time.  When these films get remastered again for HI-DEF, I'll buy...IF he gives us what WE want 
 The book offers no rigor in any sense and the author seems to have simply copied a large number of formulas from a real probability book. Explanations are sparse and incoherent with vague references to "important applications" with no sense of the abstract concept and virtually no insight into any of the information presented; as another reviewer wrote it is quite dry, I can't see Ben Stein narrating it, but I can picture the author sitting at his keyboard haphazardly plunking in text from other 'sources' all the while wondering what it means.  Skip this and get something with more substance, Peebles offers nothing more than you could find on wikipedia, perhaps less 
 James Patterson created a great character in Alex Cross and I have faithfully followed the series even though the last several have disapponted me.  The plot and character development have become weaker with each book. Yet I kept buying the books, even knowing that Patterson is more of a franchise that an author.   In CROSS Patterson has Alex wonder why his daughter wants to read the same book over and over.  When I read that line I realized that Patterson is making fun of his readers.  That's it for me. I'll not buy another 
 I had never read a novel by Tom Wolfe, and I certainly won't read another one.  Tom Wolfe is so out of touch with Southern culture, youth culture, and the 21st century that I actually felt embarassed for him.  With impressive diligence, Wolfe painstakingly mapped out the Southern dialogue for the reader with complete disregard for Georgia's actual dialect.  Hey Tom, not every Southerner sounds like a 19th century Savannah plantation owner.  Secondly, at times, I actually became physically uncomfortable with Wolfe's attempt to manufacture rap songs and names of rap artists.  In fact, his book seemed to be a never-ending stream of stereotypes elaborated with self-indulgent purple prose. Third, where was the middle-class?  Virtually every character was either "living on the hill" or "by the railroad tracks".  Wolfe focused on only the most superficial aspects of Atlanta culture--including his tedious and pointless descriptions of downtown Atlanta.  Finally, when I crawled my way across 800 pages, it seemed that Wolfe just gave up on any kind of ending; a former tycoon became a Stoic Evangelist (give me a break!), a convict turned himself over to the police...The End.  
 How can Stephen Mitchell even think of such an abberation - editing Walt Whitman's greatest poem? Sure, there are several versions of the Song of Myself, but if you want to read Whitman, read the original. The first version is the most powerful, and Whitman toned it down over the years, turning it into "poetry" rather than his initial burst of enthusiasm. There are several editions of the poem that will let you get the true texts: for example, the Library of America's complete Whitman has both the first version of Leaves of Grass and the "deathbed" version, which Whitman revised shortly before his death. There are other versions throughout Whitman's career, as he added poems to the Leaves, and tinkered with existing poems. But this book is a sham. Avoid it 
 The country music crowd built the Chicks up, then they went to England and showed their true side.  As a result country music lovers, true to their country, turned on the Chicks; so now the Chicks say that their music isn't country.  I say that their music isn't music but it just noise 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 well im 16 [writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account] and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink, but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it. first off, it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen, and that takes forever, the phone in general is slow. also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece. Im stuck with this phone for a while, and am not to happy with it 
 I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short. Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn? Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out? I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one 
 The most untalented producer in the business. Honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with Biggie and Black rob's only one hit. The rest of this is trash. Especially those chickenheads Total. And once again Puff tryin to eat off Biggie carcass. Dont give this bum anymore money, Just listen to Biggies two gems and "f" the rest 
 After  all Ive heard about this book was expecting something better.  Much of the book is dull and boring.  Not very well written.   On the other hand its very easy reading and at times enjpyable.  If you're looking to learn something about Japan there isnt very much in there you wouldn't be better off finding somewhere else that has more detail and accuracy.  He kinds of glosses over anything worth learning 
 I bought myself one of these and used it minimally and was happy.  I then bought one for my daughter.  She used it about 5 times in a little over a year and it quit.  The blade assembly as per other reviews.  It is going to cost about $50. to repair.  Now mine is smelling.  I am using my old 15 year old Oster and it is still working.  Also to my surprise it is doing a better job.  Just not as pretty.  I have KA stand mixer, hand blender, food processors large and small, emersion blender and attachments for all.  Love all of them.  Will buy other KA but not this again 
 I have read about a dozen real estate and landlording books so far. Based on the title of this one, I expected some heavy hitting information about Property Management and Landlording. Instead, what I got was a general overview of all of the topics in the table of contents, but no really good in depth material about any of it.   I also didn't like the fact that the first several chapters are about how to decide if you're cut out for this business. I was under the impression that anyone buying a book with this title would already own a property or at least be well under way.  Overall, this is a good SUPER newbie book, but if you've read even one other, don't bother 
 I was rather dissappointed at the content offered and barely impressed at the book's attempt at teaching new skills.  I bought the book for my 5, 7 and 9 year old children and the 9 year-old had already mastered all of the skills offered, the 7 year-old was bored very quickly and only the 5 year old's attention was held any length of time, but his age group lacks the concetration level to hang on for long.  The content was far too simple and barely progressed through the entire book...this book should be marketed to only highly introverted 4-6 year-olds in my opinion, and then it would get only 3 stars... 
 To be fair, I didn't actually read the entire book. I just skimmed through a couple of pages in the bookstore. However, there didn't seem to be much sociological or scientific content at all. The author would write 2 sentences stating something obvious (such as that people frequently break the law) then spend the next 2 pages recounting episode summaries of Seinfeld (there was the one where Newman has traffic tickets, and the one where...).  Save your money and buy an actual book about sociology, or an actual Seinfeld DVD. Either would be more entertaining and enlightening than this book.  
 This book is a departure from others I've read by the same authors.  There is little flow or organisation to the material.  Detailed technical info is presented, only to be often times refuted by the authors in a side-note as  not of true value.  Therefore I feel the only value in this book is in the  authors' side notes, which are in themsevles often arcane 
 I was interested in many of the details - conversations and public appearances that garnered little fanfare "in the day".  I was looking for a less sycophantic and more honest account.  According to the dewey-eyed Kane, John really wanted to be a great father, but...   He really loved Julian, but...  He really wanted to do right by Cynthia but...  There is no but, according to Kane.  John was just Wonderful John, with a license to hurt, ignore, brutalize and abandon his original family (and others) because he's, well, Wonderful John.  It reminds me (with some irony) of John's own lyrics to "Bungalo Bill", where the children ask if it's wrong to kill, to which his mom (or Kane) answers "Not when he looks so dear".  This book reads more like it was written by an adoring groupie than an experienced, balanced journalist.  I loved John's music, his humor, his genuis.  I can take the truth though.  I don't need to beatify him.  He had some rather serious flaws, and they shoud be acknowledged honestly, or it shoud be stated in the foreward that "this book is by an ardent admirerer who wants to paint a picture with no rough edges".  I can't help but think that John would verbally tear Kane a new one if he read this harmless, suck-up account. Get the other half by reading Cynthia's book.  Don't miss the forward by Julian 
 I dislike writing negative reviews but I'll make another exception here. My wife showed me this book one lazy Saturday afternoon in a local bookstore. "I want you to look at this. It was such a good idea but he messed it up so badly."  This book should have developed real conjecture on the emotional lives of farm animals. It could have been a serious discussion of what we understand about animal emotions both positive and negative. It would have demonstrated how the natural farming movement has the potential to revolutionize animal husbandry and improve farm animal living conditions. Should have, could have, would have ... it didn't.  He apparantly intuits emotions from these creatures who at the very least do not speak his language and at the most are experiencing very different emotions than the ones he describes. Doubtless he is gifted with superhuman intuitive ability from his years of analytic training; us mere mortals would be unable to consistantly reproduce his observations.  (As a brief example look at the emphasis on eye expressions despite a lack of evidence for any real facial expression translatability across species lines. Urban readers cannot readily observe farm animals to verify this so I'd suggest a trip to the local zoo to test my counter assertion. There, the most casual observer can see that a broad, friendly human smile will send an entire cagefull of monkeys into conniptions. Why? Because many species of simians translate 'smile' as 'teeth-baring dominence display'.)  Nevertheless I rated this book 2 stars instead of one, as there were a few interesting anectdotes interspersed amongst the verbage.  (Edited to add a note about trembling cows.) Cows tremble when they are annoyed by flies. Having no hands their first line of defence is their tail, but flies often land on shoulders and other body parts out of its limited reach. They tremble, shaking their skin to dislodge the pests. They shake their heads, sometimes violently. Their eyes roll and they sometimes look like they're going to fall over. I suppose it is convenient for the writer of this book that flies congregate where cows are penned together but more so that people have forgotten the 2000 year old story of Io, Hera and Zeus. 
 This is a "fun" album - but the lyrics of Shine insult SO MANY people groups.    I can't believe that a group that claims to proclaim the love of Christ would choose to record a song that insults and degrades so many.  I also cannot believe that CCM plays this song 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 This book is in the "never wear white after Labor Day" school of design: it lists tired old rules that *never* should be broken. For example: always paint the ceiling white, use only one pattern in a room, only use white floors and white tiles in the bathroom (and no colorful shower curtain, either). I could give more examples, but the pattern is clear. In addition, her advice for families with children is absurd.  As the mother of two toddlers, I did know whether to laugh or cry at her assertion that it isn't necessary to box up breakables when you have small children. What to do?  Just put breakables up high, on a piano or a tall bookshelf. I have yet to see the toddler who couldn't scale either one in under a minute. I gave it two stars because it would be useful for people who want an attractive home and have no clue how to do it on their own. I suspect they would end up with something that had as much personality as a hotel room, but if you don't enjoy decorating, that might be considered a Good Thing.  One final thought: look at the picture on the cover. She violates her own advice several times. Why 
 This book doesn't address the condition of man and mans condition as its been forever, as in thousands of years.    and to single out Christianity as war mongers is tarded, the whole world is and has been into wars.    Name ONE century in history, yes all of history, where there has been no wars? ( hint, its zero )   oh yea yea i know the debate, we are getting smarter as people and will stop wars as soon as we get more educated.     below is from another reviewer in here.  To Christian readers I would recommend considering Hillman's view that Christianity has been martial from the start as a challenge to examine the relationship between the Christian emphasis on love and innocence and its long institutional history of intolerance and brutality. Is warfare endemic to Christianity? Are Christians who reject warfare exceptions to an almost universal aggressiveness? Must Christianity be a religion of missionaries who think they know better than the peoples they seek to convert? These are some of the questions raised by Hillman's study.  without even talking to any of you peeps in here that give this book 4-5 stars, I am willing to bet that you also are ok with abortion for any reason the women wants.   Seems to always go hand in hand, hate war, abortions are ok.    Guess what, abortion kills more than all the wars combined.  At least 1.5 million in USA alone.    yea yea I know, overpopulation ( Got War? ) unwanted kids ( 7 year waiting list for adoption ) on and on it goes.   Organized religion is at the head of many of mans problems, if not the most of them.   This includes all religions.   However, the Christ of the bible has nothing to do with organized religion, so hence, you see why we just continue to have problem after problem.   I was raised catholic, bailed to Christianity, went over to right wing Christianity, and bailed out of all named denominations, now it's just flat Christian.  The problem is, not many others are doing this, and wont as I see the world anytime in the near future, so hence, all our problems in the world are going to continue.   Simple as that.    people are confusing getting rid of all religions ( john Lennon Imagine, etc etc ) With the real Christ.   Jesus hated religion, yet his people still want to be a part of it, as they think it keeps them all in line.     I know so many people that were raised in a Christian home, Mormon home, JW home, a Catholic home, and as soon as they became adults, they bailed on all of it.   going over to anything that sans organized religion and is "Just God".       
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 I had to stop the DVD about 15 min into it.   The information seems to be extremely interesting as I have been working on this thought process for years. I anxiously waited for the DVD to arrive to see what the author had to say about this topic. Unfortunately, the audio and visual quality of the material was too distracting from the presentation. I was expecting something like a Discovery or History Channel type production with images and historical facts to backup the presented material.   Instead, the "music" is horrible, too loud, and it's hard to undertand what the author is saying in places, and the images are a constant collage of the author walking through museums and other places overlayed with images of artifacts to the point of sheer boredoom. There seems to be no purpose of the images other than to fill the screen with something. They may mean something in the author's mind, but how about explaining them to us. After 15 min of this, I had all I could take. I plan to send this back and order the book instead.   I think the content is going to be good. But the production needs a complete rework, better yet, just make an audio CD with no music or at least dead quiet while the author is speaking! If you can get past the distractions, you might enjoy this DVD. 
 lack of talent leads to jealousy that inspired the author to create his "theories". 
 This book should never have been re-released.  It is that bad.  Save your time, money, and vision.  None of the characters are believable or likeable.  Meredith's story might have worked if she made her vengeful return to Billings after 10 or 15 years instead of 6.  I have been in the boardroom of a national corporation and 22 year old mothers do not have the depth and experience to head a domestic division even with an MBA.  Not to mention her unfamiliarity with society and lack of professional allies in this rags to riches story.    Cy is totally appalling.  Why would anyone trust him in business or in bed?   And yet our heroine falls for him over and over again.  How stupid.  How could he live with his mother for 30 some years and never ask about his grandmother or his relatives?  How could everyone in town have forgotten who she was if she grew up there?  And what about the mysterious Mr. Smith?  Although called a bodyguard, he acted only as a babysitter.  He could have been interesting.  Wasn't he worth a story line?  He did not even rate a first name.  Unbelievable.  This book was too, painfully long with characters I never cared about.  It was torture to read.  Even the sex was bad.  For people whose attraction was based on mutual passion it just came across as horny sex.  Put this one back in mothballs.  And Diana, do not be afraid to write about a mature woman.  Love and sexual satisfaction can still be a discovery for women over 35 
 If you are an animal lover, beware.  After reading part of Chapter 5 "Will You Be Amazed?", I closed the book for good.  Yes, I was amazed.  The author doesn't believe that animals have eternal souls.  Out of all the multitude of books I've read, this is the only one that eliminates the idea of our beloved animals in heaven.  Rest assured, if we make it to heaven, they will too, indeed.  In fact, we are also animals, mammals, just as our beloved dog & cat friends are!  So what I've read in Chapter 5 doesn't make any sense.  I'm very disappointed & won't ever recommend this book to anyone 
 okay, story straight...cash money makes songs about 1)hoz 2) bling bling 3)their pimped out ridez.  the beats are the same as last year's album.  they shoulda called this kit "recycled" yeah yea 
 This is one of the all time worst electronic engineering books I have ever encountered.  A few minutes searching the Maxim web site will find most of the material.  90% of the examples are simply reprints from Maxim data sheets, or Maxim app. notes and engineering handbooks.  Most of the material is out of date, even allowing for the book being 10 years old.   It does not cover modern battery technologies (such as LiIon, or LiPoly), and does not really cover any of the "stuff" other than the switching supply itself.  Notable by not being there would be any material on micropower processors, logic, interfacing across logic families, latchup, linear peripherals, low power switching, protection, design techniques, measurements, and a host of others.  A better title might have been "Some out of date Maxim medium power Switcher Datasheets briefly explained".  Sorry John -- you have published some good work, but this isn't it 
 You get what you pay for, I guess, but I really don't like these boots. They look fine, and the construction (appearance) seems sound; however they are NOT comfortable. I have had several pairs of Skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable (at least nearly so). Yet the right boot's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly, as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them. It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes. My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect. They also have very "hard" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.  Also I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.  I should probably return them as defective, but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive 
 This book does highlight some interesting or important patents, but just upon skimming it, I noted several inaccuracies.  One statement implied that the civil war and reconstruction was part of the reason for the patent act of 1836 (a good score and a half before the civil war), and another part of the book stated that the formula for coca-cola, the most famous trade secret in the world, was patented.  These inaccuracies made me question the accuracy of the entire work.  In addition, much of the information is available on the PTO's web site for free 
 Parts of this book are interesting, but one problem is that it is not well documented.  The author does what many others do, which is to speculate, based on the hypotheses of others, many of which are simply based on skepticism, with no real merit or evidence behind them.  I do not find helpful writers or theologians who assume they know what biblical writers were thinking nearly 2,000 years ago.  While I think it is obvious the gospel writers, along with Peter, Paul, James, and others, had agendas, it is ridiculous to say, with authority, that Luke's account of the rejection at Nazareth is faulty.  The best authorities we have, on the life of Jesus, remain the four gospels, which is likely to remain the case, despite authoritative titles and the tone of books such as this 
 I was aniticpatng a riveting documentary... After reading some books on Tibet, I thought this documentary would be especially enlightening. I found it to be slow paced, repetitive and thin on factual information (factual history and an intelligent logical supportable case for the Tibetan side of the Chinese invasion/occupation) and heavy on "experiences and testimonials" of certain Tibetans. The bit about "the American's abandoned us" was un-necessary and somewhat of a turn off. Not that this man felt abandoned (I have the utmost compassion for his experiences), but rather that the editors of this piece opted to include his comments along side the "evil communist Chinese" bits. Overall, this documentary of the Tibetan experience is too heavy on the emotionally charged (I did cry at one point), too repetitive (frankly, it gets boring), and too thin on (non emotionally charged) information. 
 I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter.  I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth).  Sorry, not a fan.  We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults 
 "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime" didn't just make it on my list of best books of 2005; it made it on my top-ten list of all time. That's why I was so excited to get my hands on "A Spot of Bother" by the same author. Unfortunately, this book didn't come near the interest level or originality of its predecessor.  This book reminded me of a blend of Jonathan Franzen ("The Corrections") and Nick Hornsby ("How to Be Good"), neither of which I enjoyed much. I found "Bother" to be deathly slow and the characters to be frankly uninteresting. I kept hoping one of them would die, just to liven things up, paradoxically speaking.  Though I hate to admit it, I quit reading after 150 pages. 
 Image quality is pathetic.  It generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest ISO (80).  Rest assured, you will be disappointed.  I returned mine within a day 
 I have just completed this book and can only say that i would not have read it had i not been required to.  It is the story of a poor man in a material world who, despite the pressures around and within him, is able to maintain a sense of dignity within himself.  The author manages to create vivd scenes of filth and vileness throughout the novel but the plot leaves something to be desired.  Characters are vague and action begins very late in the text.  Despite valiant attempts to create a classic, this book still belongs in the attic with all the other dusty volumes.  The only people i would recommend this to would be those who love descriptions and those who act too perky 
 Uhh....am I missing something here or what?  The person who is the Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce was BORN in 1998!!!  Last time I checked, that is how reincarnation works!  That's what is meant by "will enter in '98".  No other logical reasoning exists.  If this guy is arguing that since he realized who he was in 1998 that that must mean he is the incarnation of Cayce sounds more like him trying to fit a square peg in a round hole and trying to convince the reader he really is the circular peg, just with added corners!!   Gimme a Break!   I'm a major believer in Edgar Cayce and what his readings contained and am very much read on the subject(s) and this book and author are a belittling insult to the metaphysical philosophy found within the readings.  And for the other reviewers who found the structural philosophy of the book interesting there are many more out there that do a much better job introducing you to the edgar cayce story and material than this one.  A few that are off the top of my head includes "Our Origin and Destiny", "There is a River",  "Many Mansions", "The Story of the Soul" and "Edgar Cayce on Reincarnation" just to name a few of many, many good books about All this Without an ego-trip from the author.   You Know, I could claim the same thing and be just as convincing about being Cayce than this guy.  But, Oh wait! I forgot! I'm NOT SEVEN years old now am I?  Unfortunately, we will all have to wait around twenty years or longer for the genuine article to be old enough to have a chance to write the NON-Fiction version of this book idea!  Any first grade teachers out there with a unique child in their class this year?  Makes ya think doesn't it?  There are much better books out there on this subject.  Just type in "Edgar Cayce" in the amazon search bar and find a real book on the subject 
 I bought Wood's more recent book on maps (Seeing Through Maps: Many Ways to See the World) through amazon, and was somewhat disappointed (see my review there). So, this time around, I decided to get this book from my public library (yay for public libraries!). Boy am I glad I did! (Because I would have kicked myself if I had paid money for this one.) It appears that this book was later condensed to provide much of the material for "Seeing Through Maps...".  I can agree with most of what other reviewers have said about this book: The Ferris-Bueller moments (what an apt description!) caused by excessive use of ellipsis, the use of drawings by a three-year-old (literally) on many pages, the post-modernist over-intellectualized ramblings that tend to detract from what are perfectly valid and interesting points: the people in power really *do* draw the maps, and maps *do* give some people power (and take it away from others) by manipulating our conception of the world.   It's too bad that someone didn't reign the author in, in both of those books. He's really his own worst enemy. The writing is rambling and repetitive: you find yourself muttering "OK! OK! I *get* it! Can we move ON please!". With apologies to Blaise Pascal, it seems if the author had had more time, he could have written a shorter book.  I think it's really a shame that both books lack even a single colour plate, since maps possess beauty in addition to power, but perhaps it was appropriate to de-emphasize the beauty and focus on the power for the purposes of this book. Prospective readers should know that the "power" referred to in the title is of an ethereal, intellectual kind, that is perceived in the mind, not in the eyes. 
 If your IQ is less than your age, you might actually like this book. I was forced to read this as an assignment for a college course, and I lost all respect for anyone stupid enough to be swayed by such a weak argument. Shiva uses only fear and hyperbole to convince the reader that corporate America is out to destroy everything, much like all the other pieces we read in that course. I beg of you, don't submit yourself to this ... (can I say that?), for if you are really stupid, you might be persueded by it. This is the stuff that people who support acts like the Word Trade Center attack read for inspiration. Just ask my professor 
 Fable is a sprawling and beautiful game with many layers, many puzzles, and many many little details that a player might want to keep better track of. The dual nature of the game allows one to follow paths of either good or evil to the story's end - or a meandering walkway somewhere in between - allows just enough room to complete the game without ever exploring vast portions of the world provided.   These strategy guides do make a good quick-reference manual to flip through as you play should you not wish to get up and run to your computer every time you have a specific question you need answered. So if a player lacks internet access and feels lost, or would like a exhaustingly complete manual at hand to decide whether you really want to use the obsidian longsword or the steel katana - or you just want to make sure you've seen everything and haven't missed anything on your grand tour of Peter Molyneux's vision... then I still really recommend consulting the internet.  While these paper guides do have very high production values, with great art direction and some well-rendered stills or original concept art supplied directly by the game's producer - and they might hold some sentimental value as a collector's item to the ultimate fan, they are worthless as an informational source in an age of internet. There are plenty of fan sites offering detailed lists of equipment and monsters (what they do, and where to find them), and walkthroughs for every quest in the entire game - and they will cost you nothing. 
 I bought 2 of these dispensers, one for syrup and one for honey. The dispenser is too stiff for children to use, and while the syrup moves quite freely, it takes hours for honey to pour. It makes for a sticky mess. Definitely not worth having 
 The author does a good job expressing her difficulty in being a Jew and a Buddhist, and then tries to squeeze in a few ideas that try to bring the two together. I have studied Judaism for many years and I can say that she doesn't really know much about Authentic Judaism all she knows is what a Jew is in the modern western world, but that is not true Judaism.  True authentic Judaism doesn't have to be forced into symmetry with Buddhism, it is readily apparent how both traditions come from the same source and flow beautifully together. What is needed is for someone to explain what Judaism is. There is a wonderful book that just came out and I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to find out about this subject. I promise you wont be disappointed.  It is a conversation between a Torah Scholar (Akiva Tatz) and a Buddhist Jew (David Gottlieb) called "Letters to a Buddhist Jew."  Enjoy! 
 I'm thankful for the books Shank put out and they were somewhat useful for those who believe the Bible about the security of the believer rather than the Calvinistic "perseverance of the saints." But there's a  better book out now: contemporary, exhaustive and irrefutable called  "The Believer's Conditional Security" by Dan Corner. Write for  more info 
 For a 2-CD set this should have about twice as many songs on it with a ton more atrists. Good stuff, but not enough of it 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 He's The Boss. Spokeman for the underdogs and working class. Great. But it doesn't excuse the fact that he can't write a melody to save his life and he sings out of tune 
 The original Julie and Romeo was delightful. This book was utter nonsense.  A great disapointment. Finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along. It Didn't 
 Don't waste your time or money on this one. Give me a ring, and I will ship it to you for free 
 Congratulations to me! It's taken 10 years since this garbage was published for me to get around to reading it; ironically it was given to me as a bad joke of a Christmas gift from one of my what?adult piano students! It is mis-titled: it should be called Not Learning Piano for Dummies. Adams writes as an over-indulged, silly, overpaid NPR yuppie whose idea of accomplishing an artistic, creative and disciplined skill such as the fine art of music is totally unrealistic, childish and basically repulsive and insulting to the act of learning. His then-new  wonderful Steinway I hope has been given by now to a music student with respect for the theory and technique and structure of music, all of which can be learned and yes, even performed well, by students young and especially as adults WITH PRACTICE, WITH A DECENT TEACHER and by not trying to outsmart-a** what has proven to be gloriously true for centuries: that the beauty of music must be mastered carefully, with dedication and with patience.  His attitude - buy a good piano and ignore it for a ludicrously stupid computerized program which refuses the student the basics, reading and counting, let alone the phrasing of music - exemplifies the dumbing down of American culture. Frankly, those of who DO make our living at the piano DO NOT WELCOME FOOLS such as himself. AARGH!(I resent giving it even the 1-star, it was required to have this review printed. 
 I have seen Jason Vieaux perform live and he played some amazing south american and classical repertoire, but when he played metheny in a baroque suite, I walked out and realized the difference between a recitalist and a creative musician. Jason Vieaux is one of the best recitalists in the world, more than that, he is one of the best teachers and concert-guitarists in the world. But he fails to capture the true -free-spirited-essence of metheny's songs and does not convey the magic or emotion. What we are left with is not the magical music of metheny, but music that is sterile, trite, and contrived for the enjoyment of guitarists who are impressed more with the artistry of technique than the higher art of expression. Essentially, this is metheny without the color and vibrance (and rhythm!!) Please respect my dissention and honesty, thanks 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I haven't read many books written by Patterson but I liked The Notebook so I thought I would read some of his other publications.  I didn't find much to like about At First Sight.  The story is totally unbelievable and the characters one-dimensional. It is a boiler plate romance novel. The couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart. A wave of a wand and they both know they love each other. The happy couple then find and overcome adversity.   Patterson is not a bad writer. If you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read, you won't be disappointed.  If you want a realistic story and believeable characters, then At First Sight isn't for you 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 As ridiculous as I found this book, upon reading reviews from so many men who loved it, I am filled with horror.  Granted, I am a female college student, so I completely missed the abused-male-baby-boomer boat, but I cross my fingers and wish like crazy that not all men have this sort of deep psychological complex. I find hope in a few reviews written by men who are still confident that they can be men without a self help book.   Everything that can be said about Bly's methods has been said.  He is not a psychologist.  He is not a folklorist.  He is a poet (that's what the two stars are for).  Folklore is dynamic, and to suppose the "Iron John" folktale is the same today as it was before the Grimms collected it is purely blind.  The Grimms slashed and edited and put in cute morals.  If you think the Granny they collected it from would have told the exact same "Iron John" tale as the woman two houses away, or ten years earlier, or two days later, you are a stranger to folklore.  Society holds on to the tales that mean something to us.  Isn't it curious then, that "Iron John" dropped from our stock of folktales until ressurrected by Bly, who suddenly claims it is a reflection of modern America? 
 I'm dumbfounded by all of the credit given this book, especially by former author's who have written about the Agency and the subject of intelligence.  Shame!  There's an old saying in CIA that says, "There's nothing more useless than a well known secret," which leaves me to wonder of the purpose of this book, other than to make a fast buck.  I get the feeling that what we have here is "payback" from a trainee that has been found "wanting" in a program that challenged him beyond his talents.  As a former intelligence officer with 38 years of service in the intelligence business from both a civilian and a military perspective, I am intimately familiar with the training program described in this book not only as former instructor but also (and later) as one of its managers.  While I could nit pick this thing do death, I'll raise only a few questions that challenge the veracity of its contents.  First, in my not so humble opinion the segment regarding remote delivery bugs (no pun intended), p. 17, such as the "dragon fly" is pure fiction given microphone technology (not to mention  battery technology as well as laser technology) 40 years prior to Class 11.  Back then, we would have needed a Stork and a diaper to deliver  the dragonfly to its intended target.  And what about the Agency, with all of its resources, needing the author to gratuitously get it a "real dragonfly" to put on its demo board.  Give me a break!  Second, the segment, p.54, regarding car surveillance training is ludicrous.  The author relates having been shown pictures of purported car crashes from previous class mishaps that calls to my mind a picture resembling a demolition derby.  Consider the potential impact, if true, of the property damage, personal injury, and possible death to US citizens, not to mention court battles, as a result of a classified training program undertaken by a secret organization of the US Government having "deep pockets"--a veritable personal injury lawyer's paradise.  Allen Dulles would be turning over in his grave were this a true case.  Third, the segment, p. 223, regarding disguises is almost as bad, if not worse, than the one above.  From the author's description of events one would think the Agency has turned loose a group of trainees going to a Halloween party in a mall of all places.  This whole segment discredits the fine work of the men and women in the "disguise department" who are nothing but professional.  The bit about the police officer who immediately connects the trainees to the Farm as a result of their disguises is even too much for my imagination to accept.  I'd give this book half a star, were it possible, so as not to denigrate my fallen colleagues whose stars appear on a wall as the author describes on page four of his book.  Upon completion of this book, which I found to be a challenge, I come away with a feeling that the author has mastered the art of "Bovine Excrement."  I'm convinced it was an art that he had honed long before he joined the Agency in a career that was far too long in my "not so humble" opinion. 
 I suppose I was expecting the same excellent quality of Judy Lowes other book on Tennessee Gardening. The pages are grainy, and the pictures are few. Everything you can find here, is in her book "Tennessee Gardeners Guide". Buy that book and save yourself money 
 Sadly though, it does not even come close to being reanimated.  This book is laughable at best.  The only reason I could not put it down was because I wanted to see what cliche Wellington decided to use next.  The entire plot is non-sequitir.  The storytelling style -- switching between time frames -- is only complicated by Wellington's inability to decide on a verb tense.  That is, of course, when the plot is not completely ridiculously campy and predictable.    I knew I was going to hate it by the third or fourth chapter.  Granted, it wouldn't be a zombie novel without a corpse bride, but the pigeons and the undead Scottish zombie?  Huh?    I was honestly excited to read this novel, but sadly and sorely disappointed in the end.  If you want to rehash the same old tired zombie scenarios, then this might be the book for you, but it's definitely not "breakthrough" anything or "energetic" whatsoever.  If you don't expect too much, you might just barely escape being let down 
 El libro no trae nada de informacion importante es una perdida de papel. Y como si fuera poco tiene algunas paginas en blando en el medio 
 Setting aside Gardner's overt racism and fanciful unfounded theories... this book just doesn't come close to a true explanation of Tolkien's work.  It heaps incorrect assumptions atop falsified 'facts' to twist Tolkien's work around to support Gardner's delusions.  The sources and nature of Tolkien's work are readily available in the 'History of Middle-earth' series edited by his son Christopher and 'The Letters of JRR Tolkien' edited by Humphrey Carpenter.  Copies of the original draft materials Tolkien wrote are given as well as his own statements about his meanings and the historical connections to his work.  Gardner gets almost EVERYTHING wrong... to the point that one must assume he didn't actually review any of this extensive material from Tolkien himself.  Instead, Gardner simply took the finished book and started inventing a history and basis for it which would conform with Gardner's own theories of racial superiority.  Which Tolkien called "the wholly pernicious race doctrine" espoused by that "ruddy little ignoramous" Adolf Hitler.  His reaction to Gardner would undoubtedly have been similar.  If you want to learn more about Tolkien and his stories this book has nothing to offer you.  It is all about co-opting Tolkien's name to further an agenda he despised. 
 What can one say about an author who thinks that Sappho was a man 
 I really do find this book helpful but was sadly disappointed to find that it didn't have enough activities for 2 yr olds.. If you are teaching children 3 or older I think you will love it.. I have recommended it to my friend who teachs preschool.. But if you are a toddler teacher I would recommend to search for something that has mostly toddler activities. 
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 The picture shows pillow cases and another sheet but this only comes with 1 fitted sheet 
 This book is more of a student workbook with high level general information.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 I tried many times to finish this book because once I buy it and start it, I hate to just walk away from it. BUT, this book did it. I was never really interested in the plot, I thought the writing was very basic, elementary actually, slow, and just plain boring. I tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up, but I never did get into to, making this the only book I've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing 
  I'm too late as well over 2,000 folks have sent a clear message on this "colossal waste of time" (-- William Shatner, SNL).  In summary...  - Rand cleans something & wanders around - Matt wanders around - Perrin wanders around - Elayne wonders without wandering around - Egwene wonders without wandering around  Once one closes in on the final chapters (if not sooner), one realizes that he/she has been taken by Mr Jordan & company for his/her money with no story in return. 
 Back in the '90s,the Dave Matthews Band was considered the next Grateful Dead,with Dave Matthews as its clean-shaven Jerry Garcia.In my college days,the DMB was praised for blending world music,jazz&rock.It was The Next Big Thing.There were Daveheads.But then came "Everyday" produced by Glen Ballard (who also produced Alanis Morrissette's music),which was seen as a sell-out.  "Stand up" was the last gasp.When this album was released,a local Bay Area radio station was mocking the DMB as "annoying"&saying that having the ubiquitous Black Eyed Peas (who are now collaborating with Sergio Mendes&Michael Jackson)open for them made the DMB "doubly annoying."  This album has a few highlights- 1)American Baby,intro&song-Despite the use of the African kora (harp),this song sounds Asian with its pentatonic scale.It's quite electrifying.It's danceable&shows the brilliance the DMB once had.It's powerful in the use of acoustic instrumental music,like REM's "Losing my religion." 2)Louisiana Bayou-Very jazzy,you could say it evokes the New Orleans sound.Again,the DMB plays to its strengths. 3)Finest Hour-This song is catchy despite Dave Matthews' politics.Great as a song,not great as a protest song. 4)Out of my hands-Reflective with the use of piano,like REM's "Nightswimming."  Can the DMB make a comeback?It's hard to tell.In a decade,they've managed to go from being the Next Big Thing to Has Beens."Stand up" made the mistake of being produced by an R&B/hip-hop producer who tried to make the DMB sound like any other group.DMB isn't 50 Cent;it isn't Justin Timberlake.Whether the DMB returns to form remains to be seen 
 Bennett makes few if any good points in this book about the problems our culture faces.  Most of the book is spent showing how many people were "critics" and how he showed them who was boss.  Bennett criticizes anyone who wishes to include diversity in the American life: through "controversial" art which he deems a "bad joke" simply because it may shock viewers, through a desire for schooling that does not impose Christian ideals upon its students by force, through courses that don't only include dead white men of the western world, etc.  Bennett's argument is that his racist, homophobic, beauraucratic, Christian-supremicist version of morality is the only feasible one and must be imposed upon all children in any institution of education.  He spends most of the book laughing off his critics and indignantly ignoring any of their points, casting them off as just being jealous that their plans aren't as good as his.  Yet he thinks vouchers will help poor students, that an abolishment of affirmative action will help minorities, and that "beheading" drug dealers is morally plausible.  The section on drugs has a little bit of insight, but the books few good points are obscured by his blatant arrogance and conservative ideals 
 What Johnson neglects to mention is that Biblical Creationism is Darwinism's perfect foil: an ancient absurdity that most Free Thinkers, "Trekkies" and Unitarians naturally reject in favor of Victorian science.  In short, Darwinism's saving grace is that most of us, inexplicably, feel compelled to believe one or the other.  Without Christian Fundamentalists mucking everything up, Darwinism would perhaps be treated to the scrutiny that all influential theories deserve (e.g., Marxism, Freudianism, and other narratives imposed upon reality).  Questions worth considering include: Darwinism's genealogy (the attempt to apply Malthusian economics to biology), Science as Fetish - or Public Idol - rather than methodology (compare with the modern [mis]use of the term "terrorism"), Darwinism as Psychological Warfare (if the Ruling Class can convince the "lower orders" that they're animals, perhaps they won't complain so.much when they're treated as such), Darwinism as the motor mechanism behind "scientific racism" (the appeal of neo-eugenicists [the Pioneer Fund crowd] to evolutionary theory), Darwinism as Cultural Imperialism (the catchphrase of the old British Empire was "God is an Englishman."   And who better to topple him than another Englishman?) & Darwinism as an expression of 19th c. Anglo-American philosophy (i.e., Logical Positivism).  
 More of a laugh than a serious delivery of how to do practice the craft. Very dissappointing 
 Amazon.com is such a pleasure to deal with. The representatives are courteous, helpful, and accomodating. I had the pleasure to experience this myself when I was returning this piece of trash. Mr. Godek came up with a dozen or two "o.k." (but nothing extraorinary) ideas and filled up the rest of the space with quintessential garbage. My fellow Amazon customer, I wish you all the best because, like me, you are on the path to becoming a true romantic for the woman you love. That's very noble, and I couldn't respect that more. That's why I say to thee: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND NERVE CELLS! This book is not the one you need. Allow me to recommend another one: "How to Romance the Woman You Love - The Way She Wants You To." By Lucy Sanna and Kathy Miller. The ISBN is 0761508708. Good luck 
 THE FIRST 60 OR SO PAGES ARE JUST AWFUL. JOHN KEEGAN ARGUES THAT WAR IS NOT THE CONTINUATION OF POLITICS RATHER THE RESULT OF CULTURAL DRIVES. THAT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SO IN HISTORICAL TIMES, BUT IS HARDLY SO TODAY. HE UNFORTUNATELY TRIES TO EXPLAIN AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE FROM A BIOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS NOT ONLY DATED, HE'S FLAT WRONG. THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE, I.E., CLAIMING THE U.S. ABANDONED THE DRAFT AFTER WW II AND DIDN'T USE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE 60'S. WRONG AGAIN! WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT KEEGAN'S VERY VIEWS ARE SO MUCH A CONTINUATION OF BRITISH POLITICAL THINKING. NOT A GREAT BOOK AT ALL 
 Expecting sexy camp in the tradition of "Beyond Valley of the Dolls" I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Instead I struggled through this tedious, repetitive, and confusing mess of a film. I respect what the director was trying to create, but the end product is nearly unwatchable. It's starts out so well too.... "I tried not to remember why I buried my trumpet." ...but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that isn't the least bit sexy or interesting. I know this film has a sizeable cult following. It is pretty to look at (sometimes when it isn't in grainy slow-motion) but I just couldn't make it through. Maybe it's worth a look, but I personally wish I had rented it 
 Have this unit in out house, we have the one with one base unit and two mobile units.  A few things to note. The ones we had do not offer rechargeable batteries. It uses alkaline only, or if you have your own charger you could use rechargeable but would be nicer if it recharged while plugged in.  We live in NYC, Queens to be exact. We hear taxi cab radio chatter over this at times, especially at night. Also if unit is close to base unit static is not too bad but still annoying in bedroom, BUT if you have it one floor away, forget it. Unless child is screaming all you hear is static. on both units.  Only has two channels A & B which are set manually at both base and hand held units. So if you have a bad signal in middle of night, you have to go into child's room and change channel. Just don't wake the baby! Ouch!  Also missing a pager and a "walkie talkie" feature. They would be very nice. Not a deal breaker if they don't have it BUT it can be handy especially if your two floors up with baby with a full diaper and Spouse is in basement and you need more diapers from Garage.  I am about to have a second child, and I am replacing this unit with a better one, I am looking at one of the new digital units that have the noise/static reduction. Consumer Reports gave some of them their top marks. They are however way more pricey than these, some are near $200 and only one receiver. But they all have charging bases and most importantly they are static free with AUTO channel switching 
 I wasn't going to add another bad review (although it deserves many :0), but I noticed nobody mentioned that not only is it a terrible survey, but some answers are incorrect as well!     My university offered a course to prep for the GRE- for which this was the text.  All of us, professor included, realized quite quickly to trash it and throw some ETS practice tests up on the overhead!    
 Mr. Winn can bash Islam all he wants. The truth of the matter is if someone is really seeking god and truly wants to work ship him alone, he will not see a better way then Islam. Islam was sent for not just those Arabs, Islam is sent for all of mankind. Its funny how Winn talks about Islam wants money, sex, and power. In reality, Prophet Muhammad (May peace be upon him) use to tell the people, live this life as you were a traveler. He (S.A.W) used to convey the people to travel light so that it will be easier for you on the day of Judgment. He (S.A.W) didn't know how to read or write, so the Quran has to come from Jibreel to Muhammad (S.A.W). The prayer was one of the things God actually told Muhammad directly face to face. God has prescribed 5 daily prayers on the followers of Muhammad (s.a.w). Read the actual Quran and find more info. Go to the following websites. May Allah guide you to the truth.  http://www.islam-guide.com/ http://www.islamtomorrow.com/ 
 The replacement drip coffee carafe for the Krups Duomo does not come with a replacement lid.  Most replacements do, so in this case, don't throw away the old lid 
 what made the original 26 zatoishi movies as one of the best creations in japanese movie history was its profoundness, the depth of a blind wandering swordsman, often lonely but inevitably beloved by some beautiful young women, usually giving you a helpless, melancholy, nostalgic romantic broken dream. the original zatoishi movies were also having the integrity of solid screenplays, fantastic directing, wonderful settings, perfect supporting performance, amazing fighting scenes and sequences, seamlessly perfected editings....from the first two black and white ones to the other 24 colored ones, none of them was never seriously produced. and best of all, shintaro played the zatoishi role almost seamlessly perfect that oscar or any other kind of film festivals would suffice enough to honor him.  i just don't know and don't see why and how this new addition would be necessary in any way. why suddenly the great zatoishi blind swordman became an overly ruthless, heartless, and cunning mobster, a  stereotyped trademark of an vicious yakuza killer instead of guardian angel of the helpless common people? so bloody and so pointlessly gory gross? it's a quite hollow and shallow one if compares to those originals. yes, the movie industry's technique maybe more modern, but if we failed to deliver a better and newer version and interpretation of this great legend and character in japanese samurai genre, we better not, shall we say: you don't need add crawling feet to a snake when trying to make a snake look more alive. it's totally unnecessary 
 This book's patterns are seriously flawed.  My attempt to follow the "outdoor snuggly" for a 0-3 month old baby resulted in a 32 inch waistline snuggly with legs that were too long and arms that were too short.  In addition, the photos of the snuggly did not match the pattern's instructions.  My cousin used the baby poncho pattern and had a myriad of similar problems.  Do NOT buy this book 
 I echo the former review.  The filter becomes clogged almost immediately and the motor starts to overheat.  I don't know what this thing is meant to suck up, but it sure is useless on hair and small particles, dust, cat litter, sawdust, etc..  It was a waste of money and I should have returned it right away 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 This is an extremely poor translation of Beowulf for anyone who wants more than just a narrative summary.  Wright has, by his own admission, eliminated most of the poetic language from the original poem.  The poetic, metaphor-like kennings seemed to him puzzles and word games which barred the reader from the real meanings of the narrative.  The appositives used in place of actual names and pronouns he found "long-winded," and the poetic descriptions pretentious.  Wright, apparently believing readers not intelligent enough to understand creative language, has given us a translation of Beowulf in the form of highly simplified prose, with few poetic descriptions or language that will "distract the reader" from the narrative. What remains is a clumsy, awkwardly worded translation which offers little to replace the poetry Wright has hacked out of it.  Any lover of language will be deeply disappointed by this translation 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 the film features the 2nd movement to Beethoven's 'Pastoral' Piano Sonata No. 15 in D major, yet the piece is missing from the soundtrack.  instead (perhaps by a severe overlook or indifference???) the 2nd movement of the 'Pathetique' is on the album twice.  although the music on the soundtrack is good (of course it is, it's Beethoven!), i cannot endorse something with such obvious and easily correctible errors 
 I think that this album of Natalie is not so good; there are many songs that in their original versions (Criminal by Fiona Apple, If I ever lose my faith in you by Sting, Day dreaming by Aretha Frankin)were very good songs, while Natalie, in her interpretations, make them much more "pop" than they were before; "pop" in the sense that Natalie's interpretations are more commercial and easy. I don't like this album very much; the only song that I consider good is You gotta be 
 I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:  1.  When the program works, it's superb.  2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.  For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.  Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.  My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle 
 This is a truly amazing book! This is a book written by a highly uneducated person for even less educated reader. As the author says in the introduction, this book is designed for young people of all ages... Well, what's that, "young of all ages?"  Simple: those "whose imagination has not been stifled by standard educational process."  At the very outset, the author reassures the reader that the book is not going to be a technical or scientific one. He says with a poorly concealed pride "My brush with academia was a fairly short one:  I was expelled from kindergarten at the age of four... and have never managed to resume normal studies since, not to mention graduating from anyplace."  As a result, "I am a fairly stupid fellow who could not learn any mathematics at all."  This lack of really serious knowledge of anything does not prevent the author from making judgments, always with a sort of  "elegance of ignorance", regarding very big topics, like, say, theory of relativity, and holography, and brain functioning (through electromagnetic and sound vibrations), and Biggg Banggg, of course. So, my recommendation to those with at least K12 education: do not waste time and find a better way to spend $9.97.    The most surprising aspect of  this book is that Dr. William Tiller, a  respected scientist and writer, found it possible to write a preface for this book.  This preface is the best part of the book. 
 First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future.  For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying.  I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees.  The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.  I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one.  I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title. 
 Another reader suggests the Chemerinsky treatise rather than this book. I couldn't agree more. It's true, Con law doesn't lend itself to the E&E format. You are much better off writing a kick-ass outline based on the Chemerinsky book. Be careful though, Erwin Chemerinsky has at least two Con Law books published by Aspen- one is a casebook called "Constitutional Law" (in red cloth binding) and the other is the hornbook called "Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies" in a black paperback. That's the one you want.   Aside from this one bump, the E&E series is excellent, and extremely useful for Civ Pro, Contracts, Torts, Property and Crim  Pro.  The older editions of Torts are missing product liability and even the new Civ Pro ones are missing class actions, so be aware of that. 
 I agree with the other two star reviewer for this book. Nothing seems real or convincing in this work. If this had been the first MacDonald book I read I would not have read another.   The plot read like the cheap 60's motorcycle themed movies the book kept discussing. I didn't believe any of it. Travis reluctant to grieve over a woman he knew that was brutally murdered because he couldn't focus in on her personality just amazed me.  Even if you're addicted to the series as I am; don't read this one 
 Boring!  The publisher should try sentences in the book description next time, because I almost bought it 
 You're not going to be able to sell either book if you keep putting down each other's material.  You should know that bad-mouthing the competition reduces your credibility immensely in the eyes of the customer.    Just give honest reviews.  I for one am not going to buy either book because I can't get the truth.  Just be honest and you'll sell more.  Geeze, I know that and I've been in auto sales for 3 weeks 
 UNFORTUNATELY, I NEVER RECEIVED THIS BOOK AND I AM UNABLE TO RATE IT!  THE CLASS IS IN THE SECOND WEEK.  I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BORROW THIS BOOK FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TO KEEP UP WITH THE CLASS READING. I HAVE CONTACTED SAID BOOK COMPANY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  THE REPLY I RECEIVED WAS THAT THE BOOK WAS ENROUTE.  I ORDERED A BOOK AT A LATER TIME, IN FACT TWO OR SO WEEKS AFTER THIS ONE AND RECEIVED IT IN LESS THAN A WEEKS TIME. I AM STILL WAITING ON THE ARRIVAL OF SAID BOOK 
 Before you buy this book or any of the videos please be aware that although there is a small group of Harb fanatics, these books and videos preach a method of learning to ski which is out of the mainstream of current modern skiing.   Harb's competition is of course the PSIA (Professional Ski Instructors of America) If you go to any Ski Area, the vast majority of Instructors will be PSIA members and trained in modern skiing technique as taught by the PSIA. The techniques taught by PSIA represent the very best ideas and approaches that the tens of thousands of PSIA ski instuctors have found and developed. PSIA will gladly explore and incorporate any ideas that work. On the other hand, in order to justify why people should spend money on his books, videos, and clinics, Harb needs to present 'new' or 'different' techniques from what is taught by PSIA - he needs to implicitly criticize the PSIA and its methods and claim his system is superior. But think about it, you have a national organization in PSIA with tens of thousands of members all working to develop the best methods for learning to ski - and then you have Harb claiming they are all wrong and he is right. Sure.   In an effort to be unique, many of the 'techniques' that Harb puts forwards are actually quite unsound. For example, Harb recommends lifting the inside ski and tipping it to initiate turns. In general you are better off keeping both skis on the ground, lifting one ski can put you off balance and reduces your stability. Lifting one ski can also cause you to shift your weight up hill to compensate and that is exactly what you do not want to be doing at turn initiation. Lifting the inside ski is a 'gimmick' and an unsound one at that. If doing it 'seems' to help your skiing, it is probably because there are other problems with your alighnment or technique and lifting the inside ski 'compensates' for those issues. Of course, instead of compensation one would be better off fixing the cause of the problem and becoming a more sound skier.   If you want my advice, if you are still learning to ski don't bother with Harb and his PTMS system. If you are already an expert you may find an idea here or there that you can play with, but I wouldn't base my basic skiing style on Harb's gimmicks.   A much better book on Skiing is Mark Ellings "The Expert Skier." Elling teaches accepted modern skiing techiniques that are sound and effective.   I expect the Harb Fanatics will attack this review, but don't buy their hype 
 this has to be the most superficial and simplistic account on the new means of consumption; i.e., malls, theme parks, casinos, etc. it is hardly believable that ritzer takes in a seriuos manner his naive arguments, that in several occasions turn into pure idle talk, or worst pure stupidity. just to give one example, when he mentions that malls have their roots in the ancient greek and roman markets. although he states that his work is heavely influenced by the writtings of baudrillard he never explains in his matter why we consume in the first place. even worse, he never gives a concrete argumentation of why this world is disenchanted in the first place and why it has to be enchanted. so please do not make the same mistake that i did and do not buy this book. it is the first time that i have read something by this author but i think i had enough of him for the rest of my life. i might be a joy-killer to use the term of ritzer to describe an anthropologist but i least i am not as simplistic and stupid as he is 
 The product description for Killers' 'Hot Fuss' describes it as 'eleven nuggets of reel-you-in storytelling genius'. Come on. With the exception of 'Somebody Told Me', the lead singer runs the gamut of emotions from A to B (to paraphrase Dorothy Parker). 'Mr. Brightside' features all of 3 or 4 notes total and banal lyrics that are repeated, in full twice. No melody. Killers wouldn't know a good tune if it bit them in their collective arses. 
 I've bought a LOT from Amazon over the years. This was the first watch though. I've bought and owned several SEIKO watches. This is probably the WORST experience that I've ever had with Amazon and Seiko too!  The watch came with a box that looked water damaged. The watch itself has a broken clasp. It looks beautiful,but I bought it as a gift.   When she opened it, the clasp refused to lock. Its never gone far enough to have the time set or even being tried on. Amazon actually tried to sleeze out of it by telling me to follow the waranty pocedures. How long does she have to wait for her Birthday gift? The warranty process could take weeks 
 The idea for the book was great, but the book was way too long, although the ending wasn't quite long enough. You shouldn't read this book until your 16 or 17, at least. It was way too confusing for me. Some parts of the book were more intersting than the others, and it was interesting to see into her life, but definately not a book to put on a young adults list 
 One might divide economics books into two categories: those that are strong on explanation and intution, and those that are strong on proof. This book has neither, and unfortunately it appears to be the standard in graduate macroeconomics courses. I find myself wondering if it deliberately chooses the most obscure way to write its equations. For instance, in the Solow and Ramsey models, Romer retains the population and household variables throughout the entire proof rather than simply write them in intensive form. If you're reading the book after a lecture, it stands a chance of confusing you, especially because it tries to avoid optimal control theory (not a good idea!) 
 If you didn't like the first book in this series, you won't like the second one either.  Same goes for the third book.   
 overpriced and overrated.  too many candid celeb shots - wasted pages that couldve been filled by more fashion spreads or images.  and i got really annoyed by too many images of his stark, boring homes. can anybody honestly live in places like that? so devoid of any kind of color or creativity that he brings to his clothes.  i am in love with tom ford as the next fashionista, for he is a great talent, but for someone who is going to put out a book about himself and his work - where are the pics of the countless people behind the scenes who helped propel him to his superstar status. maybe pics of him hangin out with the seamstresses, i dont know -- something that would show that Tom is indeed human...instead i thought the book, although did present some fantastic images of campaigns and such, was lacking -- straight runway shots are so boring - papparazzi shots of celebs are boring also - im sure there were arty photographers out there at his shows taking pics all those seasons.. i am glad all the image campaign ads were included 
 I've always enjoyed Clay Blair's writing style. Probably because he was a journalist instead of an historian. However, as with his book Silent Victory, he can't help injecting his personal biases in the narrative. Blairs interest in U boats came about when his boat the USS Guardfish was docked next to Erich Topp's U 2513. That was later used as a target by the U.S. Navy. The U 2513 was a type XXI boat that was ahead of its time technologically. The torpedo tubes were designed to operate like a revolver shooting bullets! Blair tends to down play the achievements of the Kreigsmarine in the early years of the war, and the technological advancements put forth by Doenitz and his staff. A fact Mr. Blair conviently omits.    
 Couldn't finish it. One writer who's so close to Washington community he's become part of it 
 I had to read this in school as a kid. The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing. I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events. Steinbeck has none of that in this book. The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book. Things go from bad to worse as the little boy's dreams are shattered. Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story. As an adult I know it's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still don't like this book and think it's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories. I know it's supposed to be a classic, the problem is I don't know WHY! Some readers say "this is a great book for readers of all ages" but I would have to disagree! I don't think this is a kids book. I don't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I don't think I would ever read it again. 
 This book is easily the most insulting thing that I have read in a good long while. The author is curiously espousing feminism with one hand and slapping it in the face with the other.   Married? Never reveal that! You'll get discriminated against! Gay? Never reveal that! You'll get discriminated against! Disabled? Make a joke of it so no one has to feel uncomfortable! Children? Should be unseen and not heard, especially on campus! Fat? Lose weight or you'll get discriminated against! Attractive? Make yourself unattractive so your students won't hit on you! Huh?   Sorry, the academy needs to change certainly, but the only effective way to do that is to become the change ourselves and not hide behind the rhetoric of victimology that this author advocates. 
 Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition.  Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling.  White men were all bad, indians were good.  Women were brave.  Conservatives are anti-semites.  Republicans are bad and pro business.  Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy.  This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 Here's Steve as a young musician (not artist)working it out. He's weird, silly, Zappaish, and very bizarre. It's really a mess, Not interesting, corny, and NOT showing musch genius. I mean he puts everything but the kitchen sink in these demos. But they should have NEVER seen the light of the market place. 
 Heinlein is a great author.  When he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  Glory Road and Citizen of the Galaxy are wonderful, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.  This, however, is an awful book.  It's not merely one of Heinlein's worst.  It's one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.  The problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  The problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  There's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  There isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  The book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.  Maybe Heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  The characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  They're too flat.  If you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  I suggest Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.  I Will Fear No Evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  Someone must like it, but I can't recommend it even to the most devoted Heinlein fans.  If you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read Stranger In A Strange Land instead 
 I like Jonathan Anton & some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  It smelled like swamp water.  His other products smell great.  I don't know what happened to this one.  
 Well, if you can't blame anyone else, blame the Gypsies.  Dennis Marlock is doing very well probably, using Gypsies as his career enhancer. However, replace Gypsies with Jews, Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, and you would have a  libel lawsuit on your hands. Dennis, keep talking about Gypsies, and you  true racism continues to show through 
 The author of Radical Honesty is a complete Hack. His credentials rate as sewage water amongst those in therapy, psychology, and psychiatry vocations. He belongs to the school of thought that the more you tear someone down the closer you are to building them up. Does this make sense to you? He suggests that this 'radical honesty' improves relationships but he, himself, has been married several times. If this book doesn't send a relationship on the fritz, nothing else will. Skip this book unless you're a fan of quacks 
 Agresti took most of the material from his big book, _Categorical Data Analysis_, and took out all the justifications.  What's left is _An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis_, and no math.  If you enjoy  having results fed to you so that you can memorise then, read this book.   Otherwise, I concur with the other reader: buy this book's big brother 
 there is not enough information about my assignment  
     No this book did not leave off unfinished, well it may have, I'll never know since I cannot bring myself to pick it up again and I'm only about halfway through it. One reviewer said if you could stick it out through the first 150 pages you'd be glad, but I felt that reaching that point did not signify any speeding up of the story after it's sloooow start.  The only reason I stuck it out as long as I did was due to a lack of anything else to read at the time, but since I have replenished my reading materials, I feel no need to continue further.  This book is miserable and stays that way.  I can't imagine even wanting to see a happy ending for it, as the characters being so miserable themselves make them very unlikeable for me. I like escaping into the lives of ordinary people, but not to become miserable, I need no book to do that.  If you're looking for something along those lines try Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, but avoid this book if, well, just avoid it really.  
 This seems to be a converted thesis to book, not the worst job but certainly without much effort.  I'm not surprised its not in stock.    
 I had what was supposed to be the same model for many years and it worked very well, although the push-down handle broke off two years ago.  The toaster finally became stuck in reheat mode, so I decided to replace it with the same model.  Not possible.  The newer incarnation of the Classic is much less sturdy and the push-down mechanism would not engage - that is, you could not push the handle down and have it stay down to toast.  I returned it and set out to find a better toaster - no easy task.  
    The title of the book is the beginning of the dishonesty. This book is NOT a guide to alternative medicine by any means. Nor is it written by someone who even knows anything about alternative medicine.      The publisher is the first clue. Prometheus books has a website, go check it out. They have many books like this one. They publish many books that are skeptical in nature - without being objective, fair minded, or even informative. Some of them bother to sound scientific, while others, like this one, don't even pretend.     This book is written with one focus, to discredit everything that is NOT conventional medicine. I do mean everything, even alternative treatments that have been proven again and again reliably by science.     Of course the other blaring aspect of this book - there is not one mention of the huge problems inherent to conventional medicine. It talks about being taken by charlatans, about alternative "quackery." But it never mentions the drug companies, perhaps the biggest and richest charlatans going. It never mentions the rate of iatrogenic death (deaths caused by medical treatment), now either the 3rd or 4th leading cause of death in the US. Don't believe it - look it up - those stats are readily available on the web. Obviously conventional medicine has made amazing and life saving advances. But is is in no way infallible.          This book is written by a true believer who is pointing the finger at what he doesn't like or believe in. There is no credibility, no "science." It is just a cheap shot at trying to discredit every alternative medicine. A more truthful title would have been something like: "The consumer guide to quack medicine - in my opinion." This is only a good read for people who already believe that conventional medicine is the "true" way to heal 
 Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 A lot of reviewers basically say to avoid this text, and I agree.  However, if you are taking this course at a college or university, you probably can't change the text prescribed by the school or professor.    This text's first printing went with romaji (English letters for Japanese words), presumably under the assumption that kana and kanji are too complex for the average student studying Japanese.  After many complaints, this version was released.  However, instead of starting off with romaji (like the book "Yookoso") and gradually moving to hiragana,katakana, and kanji, there is no romaji whatsoever.  Where will people learn their kana?  I guess the authors assume you are either a prior student of Japanese, or that you will learn before you use this book?  I took Japanese for two semesters about six years ago, and stopped studying due to graduation and work.  I started taking it again last September, and this is the book (well, they use the non-kana version) that the local graduate school uses.  I can't use another text, so I have no choice but to use this book.  Going through the chapters, it seems that the lessons are not well structured.  Instead of rules or tricks to learn conjugations, you are simply told to memorize lists.  My previous experience in undergraduate was with a text called Yookoso, which offered a simple and systematic method to learn adjective and verb conjugations.  For example, you would learn the "ta" form of verbs,which made learning the "te" form very easy.  This book does not do that,and when you get to "te" form, you are simply told to memorize a list.  So, if you are self-studying, I would not recommend this text.  Otherwise, if you are a student in school, you should obtain other texts to supplement your learning.  
 First off, I have nothing against Tiger McKee.  I don't know the guy, but he has a good reputation as a competitive target shooter which is probably well deserved.  That being said, I am disapointed in his book.  There is good basic instruction on weapons handling, fundamentals of shooting, understanding angles, positional shooting, and a few other things, but the issues he failed to address are of great importance.  In this book there is hardly anything on multiple targets, rules of engagement or laws regarding the use of force, threat identification, threat assessment, TEAMWORK, deescalation, knowing when to NOT fight but run, knowing when to call the police nor what to do upon "winning the fight."  The entire book is handwritten, unedited and illustrated by the author.  For the money, I expect correct spelling & grammar and drawings I can understand.  Many of the sketches are ambiguous and not even well explained by the text.  In between the bits of good information there is enough numbingly worthless philosophies of battle preparedness that would make a boy scout laugh.  It's a lot of "talking loud but not saying anything" filler that if cut out would reduce the book by half its pages.  Buy this book if you are an aspiring Rambo, collector of philosophic quotes, want to go to jail or need a very brief introduction to using a weapon in self defense and possess enough legal and moral sense to make the decision of whether or not to squeeze one off.    Definitely LEOs, former/current military should spend your money on some Wally World White Box or a new mag. 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 The last warrior, I would have to say this is by far the worst movie that Dolph has ever been in. The plot was laughable and really made no sence at all. The cast was terrible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone 
 I did not think this was an appropriate book for my 5 year old son.  It talked in some detail about eating the liver and lung of Snow White.  It ends with a description of the demise of the Queen, "But they had  already put iron slippers over a fire of coals, and they brought them in  with tongs and set them before her.  Then she had to put on the red hot  slippers and dance till she dropped down dead."  Need I say more?   This is not for small children!  The pictures are beautiful giving the book  a few stars, but there are only pictures on every other spread.  My son  continued to try to turn the page while I was reading the pages with only  words while I am trying to anticipate what to skip over 
 What was MGM thinking?  This DVD is TERRIBLE!  About 30 minutes is cut and a very important conversation just before the end of Act One.  They cut the overture, intermission, entra'ce and exit music from this beautiful film.  The music in this film is what carries the story along and for some reason MGM must of had a brain freeze.  Also what gives with the 2.0 for sound?  I saw this in it's wonderful 70mm 6-channel stereo sound.  The kind of sound that will never be brought back to any theatre screen.  I say lets "Boycott" this film and send MGM a message not to tamper with perfection 
 A self absorbed mag that likes to pat itself on the back for feeling pity for the lower 'folks.' They named Cindy Sheehan in their January 2006 Best of the Best issue for 'best stand!' They are so diluded they think that 'nut'is making an honorable stand-only by using her son's honorable death to serve her ego! Secondly, open the edition Tom Ford and you will be discusted with his self-gloating, and sexist photography of women. I don't mind nude pictures, but he only uses women-like sex objects. Reese Witherspoon (highest paid actress in Hollywood) is showed holding a doll by it's arm with an empty stare into the lens.the men are portrayed in sexual positions with the women, and the African actors portrayed are dressed in animal skins!Revolting 
 I love Heinlein.  I think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction.  I find that his plots and ideas are inventive.  Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters.  However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring.  Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters.  The "main" characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really bored 
 This book was ok but not near as good as until the twelfth of never. that book really gives you more of an inside look into the life of Dan and Betty Broderick. This book is a quick read if you are looking for a light read on the story and not a lot of details 
 After reading "Men Who Can't Love" (which, by the way, is brilliant!), I was excited to pick up another piece by these authors.  Unfortunately I was more than disappointed.  I should have seen a red flag when I saw the title, so I have no one to blame but myself.  Any woman who decides to "like herself" just so that a man can like her is sadly mistaken (you like yourself for yourself, not anybody else!).  Generalizations such as "a balding man is a better catch than a hottie" are... simply put, ignorant.  Theory that a lengthy first phone conversation indicates problems in the relationship going forward is ridiculous.  Half way through the book, I came to conclusion that it was written for teenagers - a couple of valid points surrounded by a whole lot of common sense rambling.  Women who want to improve their self-esteem should look elsewhere.  And finally, who in the world thinks about babies on the first date?? 
 The conclusions about regret about sex and being abstinent may be shared by some, but certainly not all senior girls. This book concludes abstinence is the way to go, but since 70% of seniors of both sexes have intercourse, this is not likely. Why not recommend other sex acts, and intercourse once out of high school? 
 I had the unfortunate pleasure of having a student ask me to read this book. I was hoping for a modern, updated, yet relevant book that was less flighty and more realistic, yet set for beginners. I was disappointed! Not only is this NOT a book I would recommend for anyone just starting their path, but there are things said in this book that are pure bunk, and in some cases, outright lies. Where on earth did the authors get their information, I wonder 
 I guess if you wanted diagram jokes like an english teacher this is a good book to learn from but, don't expect to get any laughs. This book is a difficult read and I flipped through half the book just to get to something I could enjoy reading. Maybe all those five star ratings are his family members and friends. Comedy is about being fun, having fun and the ability to make people laugh. This book was about none of these. $18.95 up in smoke. I normally would not even take the time to write a review but, maybe it will save somebody else some money. I read "Stand Up Comedy Virgins" by Paul Stoecklin and it was a fun read to learn from. Try (...) for what I consider to be the best Standup education 
 This book of short vampire stories is BAD, BAD, and BAD. The books feels like it was put together in a matter of hours all in pursuit of the mighty dollar. The stories are meaningless, contrived, and a waste of the paper they were printed on. The ONLY REDEEMABLE story in the whole bunch was Angela Knight's Galahad. If she's smart, she'll turn that into a full story to add to her collection of Mageverse. Galahad's story was quite good. We actually read a plot that developed quickly and had a show-down between good and evil. It also explained how another of the three "unholy" grails was destroyed. I'm glad I bought the book simply for that particular story. Galahad deserves FIVE STARS but the book as a whole should simply be left out in the yard for the sun to destroy 
 Had to give it one star BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING LOWER. This printer was the answer to my printing dreams. For about three months, with LIGHT home use. Only fault at that time is it is LOUD. It will wake the dead. Which is OK, since the DEAD don't have to print things that often, this is the perfect printer for them... Other than noise, a faulty "load paper" error kept coming up. Then, the paper load went bad. It is very unreliable, and ink cartridges run out VERY QUICKLY and cost about 10 bucks a pop, Tonight, I'm trashing it. Buying ANOTHER printer tonight! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH 
 Though I am a huge U2 fan, I was disappointed by this book.  It is clear that it is written from a very ambiguous 'post-modern' Christian viewpoint, and this is echoed on every page of the book.  The author's agenda of reframing Christianity in the 'po-mo' world is so obvious and incessant that it ruined all the other aspects of the book.  To end in a cliche way, "I still haven't found what I am looking for" 
 SystemC is my bread and butter and I bought this book with great hopes to understand both the language and the underlying concepts of the language, unfortunately the book provides neither. I think it is a grossly overpriced useless book 
 This book is so predictable and boring that I couldn't read past Vicky's first trip to America to meet Amber.  I didn't even get to the swap.  And, that was already more than halfway through the book!  I couldn't find myself liking either of the main characters at all.  Vicky over-romanticized everything so much it made you sick, and Amber was living such an exaggerated, spoiled life, it was surreal.    This book was so overwritten and dragged on horribly!  Save yourself time and read a book with some substance.  Leave this one in the store 
 The book covers a lot of material but, the book's index is far from complete.    Although the book proports to describe both DB2 and other databases, facts such as the important difference between Numeric and Decimal types in DB2 are omitted. 
 All sane people agree that The Jam was huge on so many levels. I don't care what anyone else says, The Style Council was Weller's creative apex (most people don't appreciate truly good food either). Wildwood is perhaps the best of Weller's solo material but c'mon, it's a shell of his former brilliance. So much of it is generic and forgettable. I saw him live in LA this summer and it was fine, but the creative well of new material is dry 
 This movie is very difficult to watch after awhile. Its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all. I didn't laugh through any of the movie. I love dark comedies like election, heathers, to die for, etc but this just didn't work for me. I hated it so much I returned it (lied and said it was a gift). Don't even rent it horrendous 
 With the DiNovo Cordless Media Bluetooth Desktop, Logitech has produced a product with a sleek appearance.   The product looks sharp and the mouse has a nice hand-feel.  The mouse has a rechargeable battery and comes with a recharging cradle, so the disappointment of finding a dead battery in your cordless mouse has been relegated to "the old days."  When the product works, there is a noticeable lag between keyboard entry or mouse movement and a response on the screen.  Surprisingly, the lag time seems to be greater for this bluetooth device than my older non-bluetooth cordless desktop, but it is not so long as to make the product unusable.  However, this product has two fatal flaws.  First, as other reviewers have found, my experience with the DiNovo is that it crashes constantly.  Secondly, Logitech is no help whatsoever with this product.  A keyboard and mouse that work less than 50% of the time is simply not acceptable for my needs.  Bottom line is this product didn't even help my clutter problem on my desk, because my corded keyboard and corded mouse have to sit right next to the computer, for rapid access whenever this product decides to stop working.  This product is troublesome, unreliable and decidedly NOT RECOMMENDED 
 The book (2nd edition) is good but don't get the eBook version. It's very irritating because you are allowed to print 30 pages in a month. Can you believe it? You will find more security restrictions that won't let you read the information pleasently as it should be 
 The editor provides a wide selection of essays on the subject of the potential growth of American labor in the United States without substantiating any real insurgency.  While hindsight is always 20-20, we now see that labor has declined since the publication of this book, perhaps the book's optimism and lack of critical analysis is its major weakness.  The labor movement cannot rely on empty phrases.  The writers are drawn from well known new left academics and labor leaders that optimistically predict a rosy future for a new revitalization of the American labor movement.  Unfortunately, the editor takes for granted the writers' assertions that are unsubstantiated without a critical analysis.  Labor has clearly changed from the cold war era.  However, no nuance is detected here, given that exhortation does not bring about revival nor does it make it true that organized labor has emerged from its past bureaucratic and territorial character.  The book is interesting, but larded with hubris and hopeful expectations.  More helpful would be a prospective assessment of labor's problems.  If readers are interested in what labor intellecuals were thinking in the aftermath of Sweeney's rise to power, this book provides interesting commentary.  To understand how a new labor movement is constructed, the editor and authors must understand how capital remakes labor. 
 You know I'm not into a book when I'm still trudging through it weeks later. It's been 3 weeks and I'm still barely through to the middle of "Lying on the Couch"; I've been taking up other reading material regularly to entertain me in the meantime: Agatha (always entertaining!) and lately, even the commercial inserts from the Washington Post.     Simply said: this book is pretentious, boring, and trite. The author is some sort of actual psychiatrist, so there is a lot of good information for psych-wanna-bes, about the history of psychiatry, the current practices and psychiatric community (ie, how doctors get along with patients, how doctors get along with doctors, etc). That's all great and all and maybe the issues brought up are quite important (ie: transference, abuse, emotional instability, the importance of integrity in the profession of psychiatry, etc. This book tries to take on EVERYTHING! in such a way that the story is disconnected and poor in development of any sort). Most significantly this novel lacks the important elements of a NOVEL:     - good character development (it's fragmented and I can't tell anything about the characters -- there's too many of them and they're all pretty much the same)    - plot (wtf is this story ABOUT? as a STORY? And, if it's just meant to be a commentary, it's certainly not a mediocre one by any means -- take up Reviving Ophelia or I never Promised You a Rose Garden as good commentaries on the psychiatric community.     - effective writing (it reads like a technical manual; this makes sense considering the author is a psychiatrist, and not a writer; it''s certainly NOT POORLY written, but it's not poetic, it lacks style, and fails to captivate)     "Lying on the Couch" lacks climax, characters, and style. I am sad I wasted my time on this book -- unlike other books I have rated poorly based on their literary merit (but which still proved to be slightly entertaining), this book provided me with no new information, and had little to no entertainment value.  
 Alterman tries to deny the obvious left-wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments. For one, he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities. In actuality, at one time, minorities were in fact seldom shown on TV, and then almost always in negative, stereotyped roles (e. g., black maids, Asian coolies). But those times have changed. Not so with the liberal bias. In fact, I sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child, long before I knew what a liberal even was. I saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in Vietnam, while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the Communists. At that time, I wondered why. Now I know.   Alterman tries vainly to ridicule the expose of liberal media bias by stating that there would have to be some sort of conspiracy in order for there to be a bias. In actuality, since most journalists are liberals, no conspiracy of any kind is necessary for a liberal bias to exist. Liberals simply do what comes naturally to them. As it stands, when a new set of Democratic phraseology arises, it almost simultaneously is spoken also by members of the mainstream media. This proves that there is some degree of organized collusion between the media and the Democratic party.   Every election cycle, it is the same. Every charge against a Republican is publicized, no matter how trivial. Democrats are coddled-unless their conduct is so egregious that it cannot possibly be ignored. Whenever Jesse Jackson opens his mouth, especially against Republicans, he gets profuse, uncritical coverage, no matter how racially inflammatory and baseless his accusations are. Conservative blacks get almost no coverage.   Alterman tells us that "when it bleeds, it leads". Nice try, but this does not absolve the media of its left-wing bias. There is a double standard against violence. Violence against homosexuals is reported, while violence by homosexuals is not. Right wing violence (e. g., abortion clinic bombings) is demonized, while left wing violence is not. The persecution of Christians worldwide has received almost zero coverage in the mainstream media, because it does not fit their agenda of who a victim is. One can go on and on.   
 This is the ONLY Heinlein work I don't like and have read only once, and I've read everything he wrote that I could get my hands on for more than thirty years (since I was a teenager). I've literally worn out multiple softcover copies of several of his novels, and starting to do the same in hardcover, especially "I Will Fear No Evil" and "Time Enough for Love." I'm sorry to say, however, Heinlein completely lost me with "Job"- it's not a 'comedy,' it's a travesty 
 The pleasure of Plato is as much from his literary as from his philosophical acumen. The choice of the public-domain Jowett translation is unhappy for bringing out the literary merit of the original. This Victorian prose, while usually competent as translation, does not ring true to the original and certainly does nothing for the late 20th century American ear. One wonders why the set is so expensive when the translation was had for nothing. And why doesn't Amazon print the contents of these cassettes in their bibliographical information. Does one have to buy the set to find out exactly what its contents are&gt 
 This book is actually only eighty or so pages long with average type face. The rest of the book is just the reference page. The price of the book may be expensive to some people and Im just giving a warning beforehand that if you can check this book out at a local bookstore and look through it before purchasing it online to save some cash then do so because its a pain when you order something via the internet and then when you get it, it turns out that it isnt what you were expecting, or you felt that it wasnt worth the money you've spent on it.   Anyway, the book is a sociological examination of basically "knowing something but not publicly acknowledging what you know but rather keeping it to yourself". Topics like see no evil, the emperors invisible cloths, dont rock the boat, bite your tongue, etc. This book is a collection of all these things people come across. From a price to content ratio, I give the book 1 star. But if you have money to burn and your interested in a the topic then whatever. Frankly because the book is just a collection of ideas that most people know already, a average person can probably skim the book in 15 or so minutes and come away with all the ideas the book has to offer. 
 I was appalled by the poor editing of this book. The author is from the neighborhood where the story is set..rural North Carolina.  The basic plot is fine, being about a black man in 1947 being accused of attempted rape by a white lady because he didn't get off the sidewalk when she passed by.  This is supposed to be based on a true event where said black man is arrested, hauled out of jail by the Klan to be lynched, but escapes to the swamps and then to the North.     However the 12-year-old main character interejects her own stream of consciousness into the first person present tense story.  These are the problems I had:  She says when her mother gets mad at her, Mother hits her with a plastic spoon.   She says that if she isn't good, she doesn't get to go to grandmother's house to watch RV.  She says Grandmother gets a phone and it's YELLOW, and that the phone number is 919-555-1919.   I remember the 50's pretty well and this story takes place before that.  No one had a TV in 1947, much less a poor black family who had electricity but still had an outhouse in the back.  No one had plastic spoons...they would have been wooden or maybe metal.  Phones didn't come in color until the end of the 50's and then they cost more each month.  And it was the 60's when prefixes came into play.  Before that, it would have been KE 8-1919 or TR 7-5616.   So, the author is interjecting her own memories into this story, and the editor was too young to know the difference.  This is too bad, because, while the children reading this may not notice any one of these anachronisms, having done the research on the time and place would have lent a lot of authenticity.   
 I liked this book at first, it had an interesting group of characters, a solid voice and good potential for conflict. Unfortunately, it took a terrible turn after the first one hundred pages and I ended up hating it.   At it's worst it's teeming with stereotypes and ridiculous dialogue. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes. The gay husband is ridiculous. The white deaf old lady and her black housekeeper who is her best friend? Ridiculous. You've seen it all before and, trust me, you probably didn't like it the first time.   It didn't feel like the author really understood her characters because they were constantly disregarding themselves. Frannie says in one breath that she hates Arthur and wouldn't call him until her fingers rotted and in the next breath is urging Anna to sleep with him. It made the characters seem inauthentic.  What conflict there was in the beginning falls into boring retelling. It should be a drinking game how many time Anna tells her gay ex-husband that she loves him and vice versa. It was just played out. Boring. Overdone in all the wrong places, underdone in all the rest. Very disappointing 
 My son is a bonified Yankee fan for years.  I ordered this book for him.  Upon receiving it, I found it only to be a PICTURE BOOK, with hardly any writing involved.  To make matters worse, it was expensive, especially for what I bought! I'm not even going to give it to him--I'm too ashamed!  If I saw this in a book store and had the opportunity to look through it, I would have never bought--and I'm sure that he would not have either 
 How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here late 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 After reading Night Pleasures, this book Dark Side of the Moon was a big dissapointment. Sherrilyn Kenyon was trying to go in too many directions, and create all these other characters I did not care to know about. She lost her focal point. It became too much of a boring soap opera. Save your money 
 The Scientific Method applied to this book:  1) Form a hypothesis:  Great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment:  Interview 80,000 managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw conclusions: Write this Book.  With the exception of the "12 questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  They make several insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes."  However, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  Did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  Did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount.  The entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.    It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  However, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  If Buckingham and Coffman didn't claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind," I would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.   
 the stones in the earrings were not at all like pictured.  they look very chea 
 I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance 
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 I've enjoyed Melody Carlson's adult novels.  They tend to have realistic characters and give a far more complex, nuanced view of faith and the world than a lot of Christian fiction.  This novel disappointed me a great deal.  The characters are one-dimensional and the plot could not be more simplistic.  Basically, it boils down to this: don't have sex, because God's greatest concern with teenage girls is the state of their hymen (their actual one, or maybe, like Beanie, their spiritual hymen) rather than of their heart.  Perhaps the most insulting, disgusting part of the book is the final page where the fictional character in the book tries to urge readers to sign a chastity pledge.  Can you imagine how much better this world would be if young Christians were encouraged to pledge themselves to feed the hungry, comfort the afflicted, and visit the imprisoned, rather than to not have sex?  How wonderful it could be if their energy and passion were turned outward toward helping the "least of these"--the poor, the sick, the outcast, the people Jesus served--rather than inward toward perserving their "sexual purity"?  Unfortunately, that is not what's happening, and books like this are a part of the problem 
 I thought the first three books by Slywotsky and co. were really good. But this one is really awful. The content -- digital business design -- can be summarized in one page. They just try to keep stretching the material to complete a book -- for the sole purpose of selling. The same point keeps being repeated again, again, and gain. Check the bibliography and read the sources. They are much better! Read the Profit Zone, Value Migration and Profit Patterns. They are much more relevant today though many principles are extremely difficult to apply in today's very unpredictable environment 
 Too many fonts, Bold, Highlighted, Red black, !#@!#!^% marks to read what the point is. There is information in the book but you have to work hard to extract it. Too disjointed. "Paly"  ("my Pal said this, my friend said that ") and condescending in style for me 
 This book was painfully bad.  If you are tempted to buy it, I strongly suggest reading an excerpt from it, or flipping through a few pages at the library or a bookstore.  It's pretentious prose, with thin characters and a plot with very little to recommend it.  Interested in the Hoover Dam?  He gets to it about two hundred pages in.  If gratuitous violence is your thing, you might be able to skim this novel for the parts about Lew Beck and enjoy the bits where he stomps on legless beggers, chops off fingers, or stabs people in the guts with broken bottles.  I wouldn't have minded the violence so much had the justification for it not been so very weak.  Nothing we see of Lew's childhood really illuminates his sadistic nature to my satisfaction. He just doesn't add up, which is frustrating because he's the only potentially interesting thing in novel.  
 Merton's work has shaped much of twentieth century American sociology.   His work in the areas of anomie and deviance are especially useful.  His  work on the sociology of science is not.  In taking a purely institutional  approach, he misses much of what occurs in the actual practice of science.   He wholesale buys the ideology of science.  In doing so, he ignores  practices and universalizes the contemporary understanding of what science  "is" across space and time. More than that, however, he treats  the content of scientific knoweldge as though it is beyond sociological  understanding.  For those interested in the historical development of the  sociology of science, this is probably a necessary read.  For others with  an interest in the topic, it is probably best overlooked 
 No spoilers included, but this book has a major gimmick in it that's popular now and thus totally overused. The characters are all neurotic. The mystery is not compelling. I liked the other McDermids I read a lot better. I think the author was only partially attentive, or was distracted by something horrible and boring, while writing this tedious slab of overwrought verbiage 
 A book on AppleScript, written in 2004, that completely ignores topics "data sources" and "data representations" can hardly call itself a bible.  The problem with such books, that write from real-life experience, is just that. They miss the real-life experiences of the rest of us. This book asks use to shun the label that "it is just another book on AppleScript," but that is all it is. Even 800-plus pages of oversized print cannot justify the $60 price tag 
 Barbara Branden is a former protege of Ayn Rand.  She is also (as the book amply demonstrates) a pretentious mediocrity who appears to be able to offer the world nothing substantive, save a vitriolic, snotty "tell-all" style blast against her former mentor and supposed "friend".        Barbara should have known that a book like this would be exactly the sort of thing Anti-Rand/Anti-Objectivism/Anti-Libertarian types would love -- a "juicy tell-all" purporting to demonstrate that one of the greatest public champions of socio-economic freedom was really just a shrewish, slutty nutcase.       Branden takes exquisite, almost tragically obvious care to paint herself as the wholly-innocent victim of the machinations of Nathaniel Branden (her husband at the time), and the supposedly megalomaniacal villian, Rand.  Her "sympathetic" portrayal of Rand's husband Frank O'Connor manages to show, instead, a pathetic, drunken schmuck, completely browbeaten and psychologically over-powered by his domineering shrew of a wife.      As with NB's retelling of events in "Judgment day", the Brandens portay themselves as the archtypal "innocent, impressionable teenagers destroyed by the vile, capitalistic evil-ness of Ayn Rand".  The truth is doubtless somewhat less flattering in their regard.       It's very ironic this book is taken at all seriously -- given that at least half of it is almost word-for-word reprint of a biographical sketch of Rand that Ms. Branden had published in the hard-to-find book "Who is Ayn Rand?" in 1968, shortly before the break.    No details of Rand's philosophy are given -- not even in summary form -- with the exception of several long-winded and preachy passages misquoting Rand's ideas, and then denouncing them as "dangerous".       To top it all off, after spending 200-plus pages painting Rand as a deceitful, power-mad poseur, Branden  devotes the end of the book to detailing the tremendous impact Rand's advocacy of socio-political freedom and "rational self-interest" have had on the culture at large.       All in all, this book is an obnoxious attempt by a former "friend" to urinate on a dead woman's grave.     I gave it 1 star, but it deserves far less. 
 The chare for shipping and handling of this small item was RIDICULOUS! I would have been better off buying at a Retail Store. 
 Contrary to popular belief today, Kennedy was a cold warrior. There is no evidence at all that he was (in his second term, if he even got one) going to end the cold war, or pull out of Vietnam. Michael Lind in his book 'Vietnam: The Necessary War' addresses this issue, and points out that the record clearly shows otherwise. Several of the people who claim that Kennedy told them he was going to pull out of Vietnam revealed this information in the late 60's after the war had become traumatic for the country. Robert McNamara (one of the original architects of the Vietnam War), who has speculated for years that Kennedy would have withdrawn from Vietnam, admits that Kennedy never told him he was going to pull out. In an interview with Walter Cronkite a few months before he was assassinated Kennedy said (about Vietnam): "I think it would be a mistake to withdraw." Oliver Stone (cleverly), only shows bits and pieces of the interview at the beginning of JFK. Editing the interview to make it look like Kennedy was going to withdraw. In fact, the day he was assassinated Kennedy gave a speech endorsing our involvement in Vietnam. The claim that Kennedy was going to pull out of Vietnam is speculation at best. Go to : http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/stjohn.htm  This post details many of the myths surrounding JFK's policy stances, and shows that (by today's standards) Kennedy (most likely) would have been a moderate Republican. There was no motive (as Prouty claims) to kill Kennedy.   Also go to: http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/prouty.htm For some more of Prouty's crackpot opinions.  Kennedy was a cold warrior: he was conspicuously absent (as a representative from Massachusetts) when the House of Representatives voted to censure Joseph McCarthy (he even praised McCarthy on several occasions). He ran against Nixon in 1960 on the missile gap (i.e. we were behind the Soviets in the number of ICBM's). He said in his inaugural address: "......Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty." Doesn't sound to me like he was going to "bug out" of Vietnam.  Also, check out: http://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100vietnam.html This further debunks the idea that JFK was going to withdraw from Vietnam 
 After reading the reviews here I thought this would be a great, quick and to the point workout, but that is definitely not the case.  Typically I do the video after already having done cardio so was very irritated to find a long cardio workout before the ab exercises began. Also she spends too much time giving instructions for each exercise, I found myself wishing she would just hurry up the whole time. I also bought the 8 minute video series and maybe that is why this one is so disappointing. I recommend buying 8 minute ab if you are in a hurry and don't want to deal with an annoying instructor 
 This book tends to jump off topic (most aren't explained well). For example, they talk about one thing but the exercises are a bit different than the chapter's topic. Most of the information isn't fully explained. If you are in a class where the instructor assigns the exercise questions for homework, you are screwed. You may not know what to do unless you seek outside help (study guide, tutor etc.) or read beyond the chapter 
 When I first got this charger and started using it I thought it was great.  It did what it was supposed to do.  Why the one star then?  After about two weeks it just stopped working.  It didn't fall or anything.  It died about two weeks after I got it.  I can't really complain though, after all it cost me 5 bucks 
 THE Beat Poet fails to deliver once again. i seriously don't know where this man's fame comes from. it isn't his poetry (with the exception of Howl and a few other poems). there really isn't much to say about ginsberg's work other than it is bad. maybe if he had spent a little time in revision he could have done better. you're best off with his selected or collected poems 
 THE MOVIE WAS THE ONE OF THE BEST I'VE SEEN BUT I REALLY DISLIKE THE SOUNDTRACK. IF IT WAS TECHNO I'D LIKE IT OTHERWISE.. 
 I should have known that decorating "Martha-style" would not be my style.  Her passion in finding the "old" at bargain prices and making it "work" for her is not what I call decorating.  She loves to re-furbish, re-store and re-model ... I don't.  However, my expectations were really dashed after completion of the book and realized there was no valid reason for her publisher to classify it as a decorating book.  If you like to read about Martha's homes, her anecdotes and her convoluted names of Martha-labled paint colors, you will enjoy it ... maybe.  I've seen and heard it all before.  
 I was hoping for a good read from this author but I will not be reading this latest from Ms Miller.  I am offended by the storyline.  Molestation of a teenager ?  Disgusting.   No thank you. 
 I have been a homemaker for almost 20 years and I have a lot of experience peeling vegetables...I am fast and have rarely cut myself.  However, I bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago I cut myself so severly with it, I thought about going to the hospital.  This peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others I have used and so it some how gives me an "out of control" feeling with each thrust.  It is also extra sharp.   I can't recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 Avoid this review book.  I am a teacher of Calculus, and I am going to teach AP Calculus next year.  Unlike most students who need to review, I already know the material 100%.  I was SHOCKED by the amount of errors and misprints that are in this book.  If you are a student who doesn't know Calculus that well, you are going to think that YOU are the one making errors, but it is the book that is wrong.  I contacted the publisher, and they have yet to give me a decent response.  I feel this book should be pulled from the shelves.  They should title it "1 Step to a 1", and the one step is to buy this book 
 This book is not at all definitive. DON'T TELL MAMA from Viking or FROM THE MARGIN from Purdue U Press are better represenations of the top Italian American authors. Authors like Daniela Gioseffi, Ben Morreale, Gioia Timpanelli or Maria Mazziotti belong here more than some who are represented. And, Tonelli, a jerk about the Mafia stereotype and a fan of the horrible defamatory Sopranos ought to be tarred and feathered and ousted from his own community for representing the over glut of Mafia stories perpetuated by a myth that refuses to recognize the most important fact about Italian American culture; There is no more percentage of organized crime among Italian Americans than any other ethnic group. less. than .01 % of Italian Americans are involved in organized crime and there is no big international Mafia cartel of Italians involved in crime. That was a myth perpetuated by certain powers to make a scape goat for syndicated crime. The S & L scandal of white collar crime on Wall St. and the Enron, Anderson debacle are still the greatest crimes of theivery committed in the history of the world. Hollywood and television have deliberately tried to scapegoat Italians to keep the eye off the real international criminals, and Tonelli should know better than to represent this theme at all. He is a fool for falling for this social engineering and it mars his book horribly, along with the fact that he leaves some of the best writers of all out. Other books on this subject have done a better job, and how can the reviewer from BOOK LIST get away with such nonsense, by saying the culture that produced Michaelangelo, which is the mainland Italian culture, did not produce a Shakespeare? Where has that reader been that he hasn't heard of Dante, the predated, rival of Shakespeare and the great world writer of Italian literature and culture--a different matter than Italian American immigrant culture. Tonelli and his misguided reveiwers show their ignorance. though Tonelli does well to include Mario Puzo's THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM mistitled in the first media review above. It is Puzo's best and truest book --much better than The Godfather, according to Puzo and all his literary critics, too. So read it instead while we send Tonelli back to the drawing boards to do a better job of representing his culture.  He's an upstart who really doesn't know how to edit a good book on his subject. And his professional reviewers at top make  factual mistakes and don't really know the subject well enough to write a true reveiw 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 If you have a choice between "old school" industrial/electronic, and this album... GO WITH THE FORMER!  Made the mistake of purchasing this over Abscess' "in your mind", and it was a complete waste...    There are about 4 full good songs on this album, and most of the music is good, but it tends to go bad with the lyrics and vocals.  
 It is movies like this that make me wonder if the writers/directors/producers of these Lifetime movies think about what they are implying before they just fling it up on the screen. Here we have "Odd Girl Out" the story of a high school girl who a popular clique of mean girls turn against and make her life a living hell by calling her fat and easy. And with that basic concept the filmmakers decide to call for fascism all because of their ridiculous slippery slope theory. In the world they live in, to pick on a fellow student leads directly to said student attempting suicide. Further more, their idea of a happy ending is when the principal steps in and outlaws teasing (so much for free speech). Plus, all this is on top of the fact that the victim in question, Vanessa (Alexa Vega), is weak, needy, and straight up duuuuum. The only reason the torture in allowed to endure for the entire film is because she keeps begging for it. Of course the general idea is that she just needs the approval of her peers so much that there is no limit to the amount of times she will let them crush her. Throughout the film the aggressors keep sending her links to a "Hating Vanessa" website. Vanessa, dim bulb that she is, not only takes part in her own abuse by opening them, also acts genuinely shocked by what she finds and bursts out into tears. Late in the film one character makes the fairly obvious observation of "She is so pathetic." This comes after Vanessa has cut off her hair, showed up to a nonexistent party, skipped school to avoid the harassment, and ODed on sleeping pills all while pining to be best friends with the popular girls in school. . .so it goes without saying that I agree with the statement.  The filmmaking itself was textbook Lifetime schlock. They take an issue they don't like and attack it with a stone cold seriousness. It is kind of like a Public Service Announcement only 180 times longer and minus the camp value. I would argue that their fear of anything light does hurt the point they are trying to make. For instance, the girls doing the bullying were painted as spawns of Satan without any appealing qualities. Why would Vanessa want to hangout with these humorless droids. In "thirteen" Nikki Reed's character was at least somewhat cool. It also follows the exact same formula of every other film just like it. Girl has cool friends, cool friends turn against girl, we're supposed to feel bad that girl doesn't get to have cool friends any more. I was a victim of bullying in school (who wasn't) and I think that I am a stronger person now because of it. Our public school system now only peddles uniformity not education, so all these kids can hope to really learn is people skills. How to deal with bullies, office politics, etc. After all, suffering makes us who we are. And for these irresponsible filmmakers to serve up the idea of limiting free speech just to prevent hurt feelings to an audience not known for their free thinking skills is borderline evil **1/4 
 After I broke up with my boyfriend (whom I lived with for almost 2 years,) I was devastated. I read this book, among many others, hoping to find some comfort or insight into the process of breaking up and grieving (with also a little humor!)   Instead, this book insulted me with its immaturity. In the first chapter, the author writes under the headline "Sassy Battle Plan" to "secure embarassing photos of him to use in the future."  I mean, if you only saw a guy once or twice and are just feeling a bit annoyed or if you still find high-schoolish "schemes" funny, than maybe this is the book for you.   But if you are looking for any kind of useful advice about grieving and moving on, this is not the book to buy. I would recommend "The Girl's Guide to Surviving a Breakup" instead... 
 This book was not at all what I expected from Brands, who was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his biography of Benjamin Franklin, First American.  In trying to make an academic biography accessible to the reading public, Brands' writing suffers greatly and becomes far too colloquial.  At one point, when discussing Indian-White relations, he goes so far as to call the whites "Palefaces."  It was a chore to get through, and while it heightened my knowledge of Jackson, nothing was particularly memorable except what I already knew or, perhaps, the actions I disagreed with (his invasion of Florida or his use of martial law after the Battle of New Orleans).  Particularly when discussing Jackson's historically far reaching actions, such as kicking the Cherokees out of Georgia, or his battle with Biddle and eventual destruction of the Bank of the United States, Brands does a deplorable job of explaining what happened.  Elements of background, and why Jackson did whatever it was he did exactly, as the reader will be confused on that point, are conspicuously missing.  I have read similarly poor reviews of another biography by Brands, TR: The Last Romantic, and if First American is at all similar in style, I know why he didn't win that Pulitzer 
 Despite the some edition problems and the presence of lagoons in the script, the story retains its interest. A disturbed woman in his early twenties, who has suffered sexual abuse of his own father and maltreats of his husband finds casually, a man in the middle of the road who eventually will help to dig in her life and face her demons.          
 There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw. If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!   
 The colors and animation are beautiful, but farr too fast and busy to meditate or find calming.  My co-workers said that it looks like something you would trip off of after a "Doobie"!  I did not care for this DVD at all 
 It's beyond my comprehension how this book made #2 on the NYT list of the best novels of the last 25 years.  While it's well-written (in a structural, grammatical sense), it's devoid of any semblance of a plot or story line.  There were so many extraneous, disconnected sections that it made me wonder whether Mr. Delillo was somehow able to publish this book without the scrutiny of an editor.  My only satisfaction was in persevering to the end of this ponderous tome 
 I purchased this item per other recommendations and that of Stereophile magazine, thinking that this would be useful for broadcasting iTunes and internet radio programming to other parts of my home.  First, reception was terrible even with the reciever placed only a few feet away from the Transmitter. Second, I tried the tweak (turning up the volume pot)suggested in other ratings.  This didn't help matters from a reception standpoint, in addition, the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer.  Third, the volume pot itself is of very poor construction.    In short, it doesn't work, you won't be happy--even if you attempt to "fix" it yourself-- don't buy this product 
 I read Judas Virus by David Best and it was a better book than this one.  Marti Segerson suffers the loss of her sister to a deranged killer and eighteen years later, Marti is now a psychiatrist who gets hired to work at the same mental assylum where Vernon Odessa, the killer, is institutionalized.  Her motive for going to medical school and becoming a shrink is to exact revenge on Odessa.  What a stupid plot to begin with and the execution is just as bad.  Once hired by Gibson State, Marti immediately launches into her plan and is so obvious about what she is up to, it ruins any mystery or suspense the author may have hoped to have present.  The characters in this book are transparent and cartoonish.  There may have been a way to make the plot and storyline work, but Mr. Best missed the boat.  While not a total waste of time, there is much to be desired in this corny story 
 Can You Ride PRINCE ANYMORE? these songs SOund Like Prince Outtakes and for the most par forgettable.Long Time Coming was my cut back in 86 but it hasn't aged well.Love You Down helped Influence Keith Sweat's style.but  they were All On Prince on this Disc.this is More of a Prince Tribute Album  than a Ready For The World Album 
 I searched George Duke because he was on the piano for Jean Luc Ponty's Live at Donte's Hollywood session in 1969. What an awesome bop stylist! But what did I find? Schmaltzy pop. Go back in time for this guy's best stuff 
 Talal Asad describes his book as an attempt to give an anthropological reading of the meaning and history of the 'secular', especially as it relates to modern Western thinking. What he does in practice, however, is muse on the various interpretations people in present and past have given to the term, make some random observations about religious practices, and delve into subjects only tangentially related to secularism (like human rights) or not at all (like the 'meaning of pain').  The book misses any greater 'storyline' or reasoning, making each chapter seem a separate essay, and not one very clearly connected to the one before at that. Now this would not be such a problem if the chapters themselves were insightful enough to cause the reader to view secularism or the importance of it in a new light. But unfortunately, this is not the case either. I don't know whether it's the anthropological way of analysing things or whether he is just too modest: but either way, he absolutely avoids making any judgement or even a conclusion, instead preferring to spend endless paragraphs pondering the genealogy of words and concepts. Every time it seems matters might get interesting, every time Asad seems to make the connection to current events or political theory, he seems to rebuff his own interest in the subject; invariably any mentioning of a moral judgement or a political analysis will be followed by "but I'm not interested in whether this is true or not, but only in showing that people have looked at it in this way".   It may be that I myself are simply too uninterested in cultural anthropology to find that exciting, but either way the whole book failed at even holding my passive interest at any point. The subject might have been a very useful and interesting analysis, and clearly Asad is intelligent enough to make one. But more's the pity that he apparently feels such an analysis is beyond the pale, making the book pointless and contentless 
 Title is very mis-leading..grants only apply if you live in certain states. If you need money why would you spend money for a book that does apply to you...waste of money. 
 Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price 
 This book is a classic example of why PBS should have its taxpayer life support plug pulled when they employ a leftist to give us his "unbiased" view of the world on "News Hour."  His fellow leftist and plagiarist, Goodwin, I guess is the "balance" for his views.  This book is so much nonsense that I don't know where to start in pointing out its complete abandonment from any semblance of journalistic honesty.  But if you are a Kool-Aid leftist, you will love this book. If you have more than a fifth-grade education, you will wonder why you wasted your two dollars to buy it. 
 I have practiced Thai Chi and Qi Gong for 12 years and I am very familiar with the movement of energy (chi) within the body. Mantak Chia tried to present on several pages philosophy and practices which take at least 4 MONTHS to master under the guidance of an experienced instructor. Anyone who tries to convince you that you can master such techniques in less than an hour definitely lies you!   The author knows how dangerous is to deal with energy without knowing in great details how to control and direct it. That's why if you are also interested in such exoteric practices I strongly recommend you to find an instructor. In this way you will avoid several potentially dangerous problems for your health, which are listed on 2 pages in the book. This is serious and your health and well-being are your responsibility!   I know how to circulate the energy in my body but I couldn't enjoy even once "multiple orgasms" in this way. Actually, it is not that much connected with circulation of energy but with your PC muscle and squeezing it right before an ejaculation. I hope that someone will have better luck than me 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 After reading Skinny Legs and All, and loving every word, I bought this book on tape.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with it and stopped listening after the first CD.  How many times do we need to hear about an extra large scrotum?  It must be repeated a hundred times, and it just wasn't amusing.  The reader, Barrett Whitener, tries to do the best he can, but his poorly contrived Japanese accent (which sounds more like a German accent), just doesn't cut it.  I'm sure if I gave it another 3 or 4 hours of listening, I might get hooked, but who has that kind of time to gamble?? 
 I didn't feel like a dummy until I tried to use this guide. My husband and I are good at following maps and directions and this guide has neither. Some of the maps are incorrect as are the directions..you can't get there following the directions, believe me we tried. Makes us wonder if anyone actually went to the places in the book or just gave directions off of a map. Also if the guide has anyone that actually tries to follow the directions before the printing to see if us 'dummies' can actually follow them 
 I found this novel aesthetically pleasing, well written and interestingly structured, as well as witty in places, but hardly hilarious as others here have suggested. Regarding the book seeming to be written by a female (with all the presumptions of enlightenment that that carries with it - in this text and in literati generally) due its satirical reworkings of phallocentric myths and legends, I would say that the first 'novel' in history by Cervantes did just that, so phallused author's have a decent tradition in that area; having said that, this comment made the course material of my literature course at university, so you can see how pervasive it is. I don't blame the book for its strident and parochial feminist/misandrist and postcolonial themes - there is almost a complete cultural saturation of it. The book works in very well with current literary theory and should be used by all like-minded people as a text to place new 'Portias' and 'Shylocks' in different racial/cultural groups - same sort of hatreds with different wrappings. It's a shame, because King's talents as a writer are very great, despite the ideolatry. 
 I have never come across such blatant hostility towards Christianity  - and in a children's book to boot!  The research is inaccurate and the writing poor.  For example, the author writes about Prince Henry, "He was religious enough...." and then continues on to, yet again, put Christians in a tiny, mindless box.  What does it mean to be "religious enough"?  Don't make the same mistake I did by buying this book 
 Just to be nice im going to give it 2 stars but the only song i really liked off the album was Show Stopper 
 Th French Diet is an enjoyable read and does contain a few molecules of truth. Unfortunately, the French Diet is misleading in that it does not tell the whole story of why the French people have lower rates of heart disease, and are less overweight and obese than Americans. The book is "politically correct" in that the author does not explain that, for the most part, the French reject the lipid hypothesis, which is the belief that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease. Montignac over-emphasizes the role of olive oil in the French diet. Although the French do consume (and produce) large quantities of olive oil, they also consume large quantities of butter, cream, full-fat yogurt, raw-milk cheese, and duck fat. These foods are all high in saturated fat, contradicting the authors claim that the French consume primarily monounsaturated fats. The author also neglects to mention the ugly fact that the French smoke more than Americans and the potential impact this has on caloric intake.  
 This book is the 3rd in a series of "Hinges of History" by the author Thonmas Cahill. For a book about Jesus, the writing style is somewhat cavalier; not unfunny, mind you, but in the context of the discussions, out of place. If the style is somewhat disconcerting, the contents are downright disturbing. This is not a scholarly book. Indeed, it is full of errors and oversights, and on occasion, bad taste. For example...  "Since scholars can no longer consult it [the Aramaic version of Matthew], they have given to this putative source the name "Q"... (p. 75)." Nonsense. The Q document is not the lost version of Matthew.  "Its origins [the Gospel of Matthew]     ...may well lie with such an eyewitness (p. 75)." That's right. Mark and Matthew both wrote their Gospels. And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.  "Gehenna...pyres were kept burning for this purpose [burning children]. (p. 80)." In fact, Gehenna was a garbage dump and the burning fires were used to dispose of the waste, which included dead people.  "She [Mary] was..no more than fourteen or so... (p. 95)." The fact is no one has any idea how old she was, except that she was a "young woman" and that most Jewish woman in the 1st century BC married at the age of 12.  "...kataluma which means a room occupied by human being. (p. 99)." Yes, but it also can mean a "cave" and there is a wealth of theory and literature supporting the idea that Jesus was born in a cave.  Though this book is not without its merits, you have to wonder what its purpose is. While it is well written, there are much better written books, and while it purports to provide some facts, it hardly ranks even as a weak scholarly text. It provides nothing new, and its rewriting of the old is so full of mistakes that it doesn't warrant reading 
 Like many folks who were born too late to catch televison's greatest shows when they first aired, but old enough to remember the pre-DVD era, I had previously only been familiar with the Twilight Zone through the magic of reruns and holiday marathons, and was thus unable to discern one season from another.   It's one of the greatest, most inventive shows of all time. I don't think many people would argue that. But someone's gotta say it - with a few notable exceptions, Season 3 is a real stinker.   First, there are an abundance of the 'silly' episodes - Twilight Zone fans will know the ones I'm talking about. You can usually tell from the soundtrack. Lighthearted, goofy episodes such as Season 3's "The Fugitive," "Once Upon a Time" (which gets an E for effort for featuring the brilliant Buster Keaton way past his prime), and "Showdown with Rance McGrew" are all pleasant enough, but not haunted with the same kind of masterful irony that the show is rightfully celebrated for.  Still, these whimsical diversions are absolute blockbusters compared to the myriad of dull, lifeless episodes here. If you can't figure out the 'twists' to episodes like "The Mirror," "the Jungle," "Quality of Mercy," "The Passersby," "One More Pallbearer," "The Little People," "Four O Clock" and "Young Man's Fancy" within the first three minutes, maybe the OC is more your speed. Even worse are the dunderheaded, offensively preachy episodes like "Deaths Head Revisited" and "Still Valley." No wonder you never see these in syndication - they stink. Then there are the flat out awful epsiodes, like "Little Girl Lost," which almost certainly inspired the movie Poltergeist, but is still laughably awful anyway.   There are some classics here - I'd count "It's A Good Life" and "To Serve Man" as some of the series's best - but they are in short supply, and chances are, if you're reading this, you're probably already quite familiar with these episodes.   File under: creatively bankrupt.     
 A much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story.  The end was a disappointment and the middle laborious 
 This is the third book that I've ever read by Donald Goines and now I'm confused about whether I like him as an author or not. This book was really hard for me to get into after Prince got out of jail.  Then when the Cougars came in, I was all over it.  Then when Ruby got all Queen Bee, I was bored again.  It was just one big roller coaster of emotions. I'm still going to read another one, because I didn't like his first one, thought the second one was great...so I figure there's a pattern there too 
 Never in my life have I heard a bigger mess than this album.  If I could have given a negative amount of stars I would have but you have to give at least 1 (too many as far as I am concerned).  Bad lyrics, bad beats, just plain bad.  I have had puking sessions that sounded better than this.  I can't wait to get this in to the used cd store.  I just hope they don't already have too many copies to take mine.  I still have lost the 30 minutes I wasted going through this disc to find something redeeming 
 This book reads like a very lazy translation from Chinese by someone who has not grasped the subtleties of the English language.  Insufficient and unclear details of the various exercises. Disappointing 
 I don't want to flame this device, but for me it doesn't work well at all.  It is a very tight fit for the ipod, it makes it hard to get in and out. Once in, it is almost impossible to use the ipod, the cover doesn't line up well and often causes you to do the wrong action. Using the dial is almost impossible.  The hole at the bottom for the speaker wire is not fitted correctly so it causes the wire to become disconnected easily.    In short don't buy this product. 
 Book is MS website on paper, i would have saved money photo copying ms website then buying this book 
 I am a young,public librarian and am open to just about anything. I  order most anything for our collection.  I ordered this book thinking my patrons would really enjoy a good humor book.  I was appalled by the illustrations and will not put this on my shelf!  Please be careful and make sure this is really what you want 
 The author only gives credit to Reagan for restoring America's pride.  He also presents the same myth about "mortgaging our future" with the national debt.  Hey historians, if we've mortgaged our future, why is  the economy so strong today?  If you make 50,000 with 5,000 in debt, are  you better off making 500,000 with 25,000 in debt 
 This is a film that literally sees little wrong with child molesting.  And no, I'm not even slightly exaggerating.  It is also bizarre that I am the sole reviewer to point this out.  Janey is only a 13 year old teenager.  She is indeed rather mature for her age.  Nonetheless, Janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her.  Such an adult male (or female) is clearly breaking the law.  Janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined.  The father is being played for a fool.  This dysfunctional family seems doomed.  Janey's younger brother needs her love and protection.  Is she capable of handling this responsibility?  Will matters finally get out of control?  "Rain" is morally bankrupt.  The story line takes place in New Zealand. Perhaps the people associated with the American TV program "To Catch a Predator" and "Perverted Justice" should visit this country.    David Thomson Flares into Darknes 
 I'm an espresso/cappucino only drinker, and have owned a variety of machines over the past 20 years. I've had this one for less than a week and it's going back to the store for refund. After having read all of the reviews, here is exactly what is correct and what to expect (p.s. if you're not a cappucino conniseur, please don't bother writing a review):  Pros:  1 - built like an absolute tank. Beautiful style and construction (this does not mean excellent engineering... just means not 'flimsy'). The thing weighs like 40 pounds). 100% durable.  2 - short wait time for water to get hot. Like this really matters compared to a boiler-type machine (this is thermoblock). A boiler takes what, 7 minutes and this one takes 4? Are you that much in a rush for a cup? Takes 20 minutes at Starbucks.  Cons:  1 - I have a $1,100 Pavoni, the best boiler/manual pump machines in the world. You can't come close with the Breville. At best with fine ground espresso I can get slightly rich coffee while the machine pumps for 5 minutes.  2 - The filters stink. The double-wall on them is only there because the machine does not produce enough pressure/temperature. The filters leave a soupy mess and not a dry puck (a puck is indicative of a boiler system). Makes you want to drill holes in the bottom of the filters (as is, there's only a single pinhole that gets clogged).  3 - What steam? When you first switch to steam mode, it spits out a nice 2-3 second stream of water. And whatever you call the air pithing out you can put your hand up to for a bit without scalding. You're better off making foam using your lungs and a straw, then nuking it in a microwave. It hardly produces any foam.  4 - The hot plate on top is not a hot plate. It's a luke-warm plate. My heating pad for my back is warmer.  Overall, if you're an inexperieced cappucino maker who thinks Dunkin' Donuts hung the moon, get this machine. Otherwise it will end up being returned or being a workshop anvil 
 	I am a sixth grader. The Prophet of Yonwood is the third Book of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau. This book is about a girl named Nickie who visits a town named Yonwood. Someone in her family recently dies and her family inherits the house. The country is about to go into war and everybody is scared. Nickie is an 11 year old. She loves the house. She wants to get away from the city and move to Yonwood. She has three goals: 1. Keep Greenhaven, the name of the house, 2. Fall in Love, and 3. Help the world. Nickie starts to tattle on people thinking that she is doing something good but things turn bad. Yonwood isn't as good as Nickie had imagined. 	My favorite part in the book was when the army of dogs return to the town. All the people were happy that they got their dogs back and so was I. 	If you like love stories and a bit of scary parts, you would like this part. I didn't. 	This book is one of a series of three. The two other books are The City of Ember and The City of Sparks. Now you can read the books in a different order starting with The Prophet of Yonwood and continue the story or you can start with the first book, The City of Ember. The Prophet of Yonwood explains what happened in the first book but if you don't want anything given away, you should start with the first book, The City of Ember. Maybe Jeanne DuPrau should write some more of this series. I would read them.  
 Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does "Dream of Mirrors" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with "Thin Line" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original "Iron Maiden" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named "Too old, too tired!" & quit defiling the great name of "IRON MAIDEN" 
 The author makes strong statements without proving them. His arguments are easily refutable, his "data" yields itself better to different and much more humanistic interpretations.  Don't waste you time and money, unless you are a female chauvinist trying to boost your self-confidence by any means 
 Orson Welles was a master of film. But not this film. While I appreciate the message he is trying to convey, his "cleverness" is off the deep end.   This film is like a big ego-trip for Welles.  He's so proud of how clever he is.  But the film is a mess, like paranoid, disjointed ramblings.   In his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style. Clever is most clever when it is not obvious.   In this film he beats you over the head with the "subtext" and thinks he's cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a jumbled-up the story line.   I'm sorry I wasted my time to watch it.  I would have turned it off, but given my high respect for Welles, I continued, expecting a revelation or twist.   Alas, no, it was just a stupid movie 
 I've been to seminars by Inmon, Kimball and Imhoff, as well as read many of their books. Kimball on the one hand, is generally clear and concise on the subject and obviously understands not only DW design and implementation concepts, but how they relate to various businesses and how the business really uses the data. He's also a fairly humble man in person.  Both Inmon and Imhoff on the other hand are rather self-aggrandizing (Inmon once waltzed into one of his keynote speeches dressed like a boxer to the theme from Rocky!), and both Inmon and Imhoff seem to have based their careers around bashing Kimball. In their desperation to present an alternative to Kimball's methodology and carve out their own niche, they've presented mostly incoherent, illogical and unusable ideas sometimes laced with anti-Kimball baggage. I get the feeling Inmon is kind of like James Martin was back in the 80's, churning out countless cookie-cutter style books of dubious quality.  I've designed a number of dimensional data warehouses and data marts that actually work years later using the Kimball approach, but honestly, every book I've read by Inmon and/or Imhoff has left me wondering who in the world actually uses their approach (if you can call it that) to build real-world data warehouses.  If you want to have a complete library and money is no object, by all means, read everyone's ideas on data warehousing and compare and contrast for yourself (I did - I must own fifty books on the subject - but I rely on only about 5-6 books in my day to day work as a DW architect - the rest are just taking up shelf space and reminding me how nice it is to be able to read reviews at places like Amazon before you buy). If money is an object and/or you are just starting out in the field and trying to learn the basics of DW design, do yourself a big favor and get the three excellent Kimball books (The Data Warehouse Toolkit, The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit and The Data Warehouse ETL Toolkit). The Adamson/Venerable book: Data Warehouse Design Solutions is a very useful adjunct for additional examples of real-world dimensional designs 
 this is by far the worst moive I've seen. I LOVE the first secret garden. No one can do a sequel to a moive as good as the origanl. It's a classic. But this sequel is terriable. It controdicts the first moive. It takes the magic away. If you liked the origanl, first moive don't watch this, it will take the magic out of the first moive 
 I think this book was TERRIBLE.  It was boring.  It was a little exciting in a few parts but listen to this.  A boy finds s bear abused, wants to protect it, buys the bear, everyone thinks he's dangerous and is sent to live on an island.  YAWN!  On top of all of that, theres a lot of dying.  What a WONDERFUL BOOK TO GET! It was a school book that everyone read together.  Torture! I highly reccomend you DON'T read this book 
 In his "History of Warfare," John Keegan does not match the mastery that Victor Hanson displays in "Carnage and Culture." Keegan does not convincingly demonstrate that military superiority mirrors larger social, economical, political and cultural practices, which have little relevance to the art and science of warfare.  Keegan is not convincing when he attempts to prove Carl von Clausewitz wrong that war is not the continuation of politics by other means.  Although Keegan's analysis is sometimes interesting, it is mainly anecdotic and bogged down in detail that fails to capture the target audience.     
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 Being the horror fan that I am....I was quickly drawn to the cover of this book...after I began reading the book....I was scared too death....scared of the story that is....This storyline has been done and I was not even interested in finishing this book, but just to prove myself right I did finish the book only to be completely satisfied that I WAS right and It ended just like every other story like this....Dont even bother and read a real story from a real author like...Neil Gaiman, Dean koontz, etc.  Please pass on by this title.  Later readers!!! 
 Absolutely one of the worst books of all time.  It took at minimum sixty pages to realize the heifer was missing and then it was downhill from there.  I had such high hopes for this book, but it is not worth your time, so don't bother.  I was mentally ticking off all bayous convenient to NOLA so at least half of the characters could be dumped.    I will give the author another chance, but if her main character is as snotty in the rest of the books, forget it.  That goes for the rest of the characters.     
 This was a hugely disappointing film. I did not see it on stage nor do I want to if it is ever resurrected. It trivializes illness, death, God, heaven, range of human emotion and love in all forms. I have grown up in a post-AIDS world and can see so many problems far worse than AIDS.I am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits. While America focuses on such banal subject matter, larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality 
 What the hell is this crapola? The real Misfits were not about lame as* bullsh*t! Like everyone else says, what you usually hear without Danzig has lost it's edge. They lost their edge. What's the point of making music and calling yourself the Misfits when you're really not changing anything? Punk is about change. Change is usually edgy, this is honestly far from that. The Misfits changed music - they had their own sound, they were original, and nobody else had that sound. I'm saying this about alot of other bands. We're not Danzig heads, we're not kissing as*. The Misfits truly lost their edge. We're not expecting every band to always sound the same - but at least create newer and edgier music because nowadays every band sounds the same. It's all up to the original bands to influence everybody, and when you're making music that doesn't influence anyone, what's your point - money? 
 What more can I say than the above?  It is flimsy, doesn't stay in adjustment, rattles around when you move, and looks cheap to boot.  Don't waste your money, this thing is junk. It would be more appropriately priced at $5.00. 
 I am just sitting here reading this book, studying for a huge exam tomorrow morning, and I am just getting so incredibly frustrated with this book and decided that I should let it out on here. Oh my God, there is a mistake on like every friggin page... and to make matters worse, all the mistakes are right smack-dab in the middle of an example problem. So there you are, trying to learn how to work certain problems, and all of a sudden, there's something that just doesnt seem to make any sense. And the whole time you're thinking that you're stupid and you just cant figure out the correct way to do the problem, until a wasted-hour later, you finally realize... "oh, its just ANOTHER stupid mistake these idiots made, and i thought i was retarded." Grrrr, this is killin me.  I cannot freakin believe that they could actually charge $140.00 for a book no one even bothered to proofread. okay, so point of the story is... this book sucks, dont buy it if you can get around it, i'd recommend. 
 I believe Mr. Jenkins must have been paid by the exclamation point, so liberal is he with their use.  While his story should be interesting to the wanderers among us, his telling of it is so hamfisted that I just couldn't bear to continue.  Jenkins needs a harsher editor or better yet, a ghost-writer.  This book reads like a high-school senior's lengthy "personal narrative" for a college admissions essay.  But perhaps I'm being too generous. 
 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
 come on jerry.. i am probably your biggest fan and even when i bitch about everything, i am not an iota bitter about your billion dollars but this book is just a print out from a few web pages pinned together 
 There is not anything in this book that is especially helpfull. It is also a thin book. If it was typset instead of handwritten it would be too short to even call a book - more of a pamphlet. I'm unsure why all the good reviews. I would think that a book called "Depression as an Opportunity for Spiritual Growth" would have provided more understanding of this opportunity and how to take advantage of the opportunity. 
 I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed by a "celebrity event."  I used to say, "Heck, I'd watch William Shatner read the phone book," and now I'm sure that would have been a better use of time (his AND mine.)  Full five stars to Leonard Nimoy for not participating in this crude, cruel, and contemptible exercise.  There were a couple of very funny moments, as when one of the pack of "comedians" did a spoof on having to have a speech coach ...  for years  ...   and years ...  to correct ,,, his tendency  ... to speak as Shatner did and still probably does in Boston Legal.  My advice:  go watch old Star Trek, old TJ Hooker, new Boston Legal -- anything but this nasty bit of trash. Can only hope he got paid well for participating. 
 listening to this you will not be able to stay awake more than five minutes. it should come with a warning label advising not to drive a car or lift heavy things. pop this in while cruising i-95 in joisey and you'll be plugging up that left lane with bruce inspired slowness for miles. and do not lift anything heavy if you value your toes. yet another snoozefest about depression, oppresion and poverty from rocks poorest billionaire. zzzzzzzz 
 This piece of filth was written by a self-loathing male and is bought by misandric, self-centered imbeciles. It's nothing but a grocery list of men's faults and an insinuation that women, in contrast, are perfect. Even violence against men is joked about: suggestions of women shooting men and even severing their private parts.  If there were a similar book about WOMEN being awful, NOW would have sent death threats to the publishing house. Ridiculing men for about a hundred pages is no different.  This piece of sexist garbage is for the woman who says how much she hates men -- and then wonders aloud why no one will go out with her. Who in his right mind would 
 This book used to be a must the first time it has been published but after ten years it is getting old and the topic is now better covered by some others authors. The arch/garch section is really weak and this book by its sole is not enough to implement advanced models.  The authors also forgot to include practical implementation of the models with Splus or Matlab or whatever language, which is now almost a standard in many financial engineering related books. 
 This movie is being described and sold as a comedy.  It is not one.  It has several funny lines, but the movie is more of a romantic drama.  If you are looking for a comedy I do not recommend this at all 
 Some how my previous review text got a little glitched up.  But suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut.  The manufacture of these knives is well below the quality I expected ....  It's the first time I;ve been TOTALLY disappointed ....  We're returning the knives because they are not worth the money.  Really, they look great in the picutre, but they are very poor quality.  Why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars 
 I agree with everything Anne M. Koch had to say about this book in her earlier review of it, and I'd apply it to Dodman's other books, too. I add these thoughts as well:  Once you've read two of Dodman's cases, you know the formula: "This was the presenting case--this is what I pessimistically taught the owners to do with their pet--and THIS is the drug I prescribed!" His books are stultifying once you've learned the key behavioral factors he identifies (which are useful in and of themselves).  Does Dodman care at all about these animals, beyond their usefulness as subjects for his drug experimentation and potential appearance in the next repetitive volume he grinds out? His persona is reptilian and ambitious once you get past the stilted expressions of his caring about the creatures he so readily medicates out of their gourds.   Even more bothersome to me is his failure to draw any ethical line when it comes to dogs suffering radical predation/aggression. Were Dodman a bit less thrilled with his own pharmaceutical heroics, he might realize there's a time to say, "Either find another home for this dog or put him down, or I can't be responsible if he devours your baby or maims your friends." No, Dr. Dodman: when such a dog is 90% better on drugs, I'm not risking that 10% around my loved ones, thank you!  I think that his volumes might have a limited usefulness to practicing veterinarians, if they can get past their author's false-ringing tone, and if you know little to nothing about dogs and cats, you'll pick up a few key bits of information--over and over again.  I'm in search of better authors on the subject, and I plan to read the books recommended by Koch in her review-she seems more knowledgable and human than the author at point here is 
 My husband and I just bought this toy for my daughter today. She loved her cousin's 'similar' toy (different brand), but we thought this product was cuter, although more expensive. Well after 20 minutes of play, we decided that it needed to go back for several reasons: 1. The wheels are very cheaply made and do not turn (her cousin's cart turned like a real cart). 2. The basket is way too small. 3. The basket comes off too easily. 4. The cardboard boxes are obviously silly and wouldn't last a minute if we had given them to her, but the cuteness of the other food items outweighed this negative point for us.  Due to numbers 1 and 3 above, my daughter became easily frustrated with the cart not turning. But being a good sport, she moved around to the other side trying to turn it that way, but then of course the basket (which almost falls off anyway), gives way and she fell flat on her face. Shame on us for choosing "cute" over sturdy! Beware - this product may be unsafe. We're taking it back today and exchanging it for the same one her cousin had at 1/3 of the price -  we already know it will turn, the basket is large, and it won't fall apart!  
 At the outset it worked very well. To the few months the pencil failure. Now single use mouse. But sometimes it works very badly. He is very annoying. I do not recommend to acquire this product. Cheap it leaves expensive. He is better to pay a little but to obtain a good article more 
 Someone's trying to kill Soap star Mary Lisa Beverly, and how I wish they'd succeeded. This book doesn't do either the mystery or romanance genres justice, and thread throughout is a lame shooting report from the set of the soap whose title forms the title of the book. Does anybody care that Mary Lisa's character in the soap meets her long-believed dead father? What does this have to do with the death plot? And what's a small town cop from Oregon doing stepping into an investigation in California? The book explains Mary Lisa's father and a rejected lover both asked him to, but Jack Wolf's got his own murder to sleuth, so what's he doing in Oregon, other than making eyes at our heroine. Much of the book centers on flirting between the Oregon sheriff and Mary Lisa, stuff that has little to do with the plot and indeed detracts from it, and the book is in serious need of an editor. At one place, Mary Lisa refers to the "Sheik of Aran." Argh!  This is one to skip. Generally a good writer, Catherine Coulter must have pulled this one out of the rejected pile. It should be thrown back 
 Cute describes these books in the 10-mintues-a-day series.  Pleasant, a little fun, a little insipid.  But, really, not so bad just to get a taste of the language before you decide to move on to deeper study.  Actually--in contrast to more than one other reviewer--I found the word-substitution presentation to be quite helpful in anchoring the meaning of the word into my memory.  This is not an untried method, being also used in the EasyLearn Language audio programs, and other texts.  Those word stickers don't stay on too long, though.  Be prepared to lose a lot of them 
 I have no doubt that Hoff makes wonderful presentations, but he's written the book as though he's making a presentation. The techniques of effective writing are very different from those of effective speaking. Hoff takes pages and pages to make even the simplest point, something that could have been communicated in three sentences perfectly well. He can't simply just come out and state a something and be content with the fact that he's just shared something extremely useful. He comes off as trying to entertain more than inform. If you're making a presentation to high school students, maybe that's a good idea. But after 50 pages in a book, it starts to feel incredibly condescending. If you want a book that assumes you're reasonably intelligent, don't buy this one 
 The book is 10% about Jefferson and 90% about the author's far-left political agenda.  I also lost trust in him after reading his criticism of American voters' low turn outs in comparison to Austalia, while failing to mention that in Australia, voting is compulsory.  It makes me wonder how many other self-serving "facts" he used.(? 
 I never received the product despite desperately trying to correct your error in persisting to consider my two-year's old address current.  And because you refuse to have any vital contact with your customers but merely treat them as numbers I've decided never to do business with your Brave New World monolith again.  Thanks for nothing.  The money I lost due to your policy of disconnectedness from your buyers was well worth the result 
 For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age, it actually had potential even in the very beginning. Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed, leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake. We tried tightening it to her as much as possible, and she still scooted down it. After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether. Maybe our baby was just too squiggly, but honestly I just found it dangerous. I think it is a great idea, but the product needs some work. 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 Great idea for a story - but just an "ok" book that could have been so much better 
 A book of total lost leads, great starts to intrigue, interesting ideas and insights, teasing insinuations, and no meat to be found.   A very disappointing book 
 If you just want an expensive, cute little stuffed animal, by all means buy away.  If you are looking for a nice place on the web for your kids to play, consider that your kids may walk away very frustrated.  There is no way to contact Webkinz (that I can find) for the following issues:  1) Your child can use up a half hour of their alloted computer time just trying to log on to Webkinz.      2) There are many error massages.  Most do not make sense.  Webkinz technical support offers no support.  It basically just blames any problem you are having on your ISP or that your Flash Player is not working (even though it worked yesterday and it will work again tomorrow).  3) It sometimes logs your child out right in the middle of a game.  My children have simply stopped bothering with Webkinz and have lost interest in their stuffed Webkinz toys.   
 I was expecting a book which would explain how to handle specific requests from the film directors.  A book which would contain the "tricks of the trade" drawing solutions for the cameramen to understand ... it was an enourmous disapointment to me to find out that the book contained chapter after chapter talking about perspective and how to draw.  The title is misleading and the drawings are rather dull.  I would only recommend it to students with limited drawing knowledge and desire to storyboard.  For me it was a waste of money 
 I hate these new taller books.  Supposedly they are easier to read....actually they are just more money for the publishers.  The reason I buy paperbacks is because they are less expensive.  Then the publishers all got together and decided to shaft the paperback customer by offering some releases only in the taller size for 2 dollars more.  I read 3 books a week, so I can't afford to waste money for a larger book with the same story.  Does it add anything to the book?  No, just more cost.   I refuse to buy this book on principle.  Maybe if my library has the hardcover I will borrow it from them, but I refuse to put more money in the publishers' coffers when they aren't offering this in the normal paperback size.  If it was really for the reader's benefit that they offer the larger size, they would offer both sizes to better serve the consumer. I have seen only the taller book in every store I have visited, there is no regular paperback of this story.  
 I would have to say that my first impression of this book was, "It's more like a 'Nancy Drew' story, just with a lot of sex." I honestly liked "Q" better than this, because it focused on a murder investigation, instead of some Byzantine financial crime that takes pages to explain and that many authors seem to be fond of anymore.   On the plus side, I'm glad that Kinsey has a new love interest, and am interested to see where that goes. On the minus side, while the senior citizens' love triangle is amusing, it adds nothing to a slow story that I had to force myself to finish. And another thing, didn't Henry's brother William (I think that's his name) give up the hypochondiacal behavior several books back?  Up through "G", these books were excellent murder mysteries. Then, starting with "H," the stories slowed down, and it seemed like the crimes were leaning more towards money laundering/pyramid schemes, than towards the formula that made this a good series.  I'd have to say that this story is for "hardcore" Kinsey fans only. It starts slow and stays that way.  Here's hoping that "S" will be better 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 I have never read one of Johansen's books and after reading this one, I'm not likely to read another.  I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means, but I just couldn't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing.  Exclamations such as "dear heaven" and "lord" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book, which doesn't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma, however).  As another reviewer said, the big mystery of why Daisy wouldn't leave Geneva wasn't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him.  Character development was lacking and I just didn't care that much about them.  I would have liked to hear more about Cynthia and her antics.  I did finish the book because I was curious to know what happened, but I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Sorry, but this was not my cup of tea 
 Many parents search for keys to make their children successful.  It is unwise to think a book will do the trick, as many textbooks go unread.  I was sent to this book by a co-worker who had many problems with both his children and his step-children.  He confirmed that it was the be-all-end-all.  All his children were encouraged to read it.  5 months later, he was a grandfather for the 3rd time by his 17 year old daughter.  There is extensive evidence that parents are the single most important infuence on a young persons' life, yet many adults are in denial about this and choose to blame society in general or the kids themselves.    Many (not all) difficulties can be dealt with by communication and "getting real" with their kids instead of denial.  Some families will be bettered by this book.  I think it would best be read by both child and parent with open discussion about the issues it presents.  
 This book would never have made it to press had it not been for the fact that India Hicks is the granddaughter of Lord Louis Mountbatten and 2nd cousin to Prince Charles.  Can we talk?  The book is pure drivel.  All of the information contained in this airy-fairy, pseudo-aristocratic, jet-setty, new-agey book has been written about for years.  Such pearls of wisdom as: Get enough sleep. Drink lots of water. Please, spare me.  While this could have been a classy book, naked photos of India Hicks, made it lose my vote. I guess I'm an old "prude", but if you are connected to the Royal family, keep your clothes on. 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 This book is so embarrassingly bad that it's beyond comprehension how the Book Review editor of the New York Times could give it a good review 
 Horrible. They're young. They're old. It's the past. It's the future. Nothing is as it seems. Nothing makes sense. It's just a bunch of garbbled trash. Poor Grant Morrison had to be under the influence of some illegal drug to actually think this mess made any sense. Stay off the dope, man. It messes up your mind. I had to force myself to finish this. It was painful, but I did it. Horrible. Awful. Please, don't waste your money. I'll tell you all you need to know... at the end they disband the JLA. Why they do is not important, because in the very next issue (JLA: Strength in Numbers) they re-group. Skip this book and go straight to "Strength in Numbers", which is far superior than any of the previously published JLA books (Rock of Ages, being the worse) 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 I read this book and yes it is a page turner, and I also watched the movie.  This prompted me to do some research into this case and I've come to the conclusion that this woman was wrongfully convicted of a crime she did not commit.  I think this author fantasized a great many details in her book.  If you do just a little looking into this case you will probably come to my same conclusion.  This is not an isolated case, this happens time and again on many levels of our legal system.  And the sad thing is, she's still in prison.  The author of this book has made a lot of money off this case and it is not even an accurate portrayal of events and the blatant miscarriage of justice.  Shame on everyone involved 
 I have serious misgivings about the facts presented in this book.  The original French text was written in the 20's.  I was given this book as I am working on a masterwork on the cultural history of Olives and Olive oil.  In this respect she often jumps to the wrong conculsion, and makes broad judgements that have been discounted by anthropology since the 1960's. For instance she lists oil stores in ancient Babylonia as being olive oil.  We know from further scholership that this would have been sesame oil, and that olive oil was a fuel and not a consumptive in that culture at the time.  This causes me to question the entire book.  This may be an interesting read, but at least with respect to Olives and Olive oil, there is much better out there 
 Although I myself confess I am no great fan of Heinlein's, I found it hard to believe this was written by the author of "Stranger in a Strange Land" which is a masterly work. The idea behind "The Number of the  Beast" is appealing: a vast number of alternative universes, endless possibilities for exploring mysteries and opportunities for a real sense of wonder. Unfortunately this is all wasted as heinlein trawls seemingly without purpose through an interminable series of unfunny jokes and mundane inanities. For example he invents a universe just like ours except with no letter J. He indulges his predeliction for creating middle aged women referred to as "Auntie" and adopts a writing  style which actually manages to parody his own already flawed and overly jaunty mannerisms. The satire is lost in a tale that is quite simply, utterly lifeless. In short , "The Number of the Beast" is a disaster and caused me to avoid Heinlein for years until I read "Stranger in a Strange Land." Even though I don't really like his works as a whole, even I was able to recognise the extent to which he has fallen below his own standard with this trash 
 My mother bought this for me for Christmas. She used the "available new and used" section to get it a little cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45. As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the Hans Wehr edition 
 I realize that I'm supposed to think "Empire" is brilliant, because it's Gore Vidal, but it is a major bore.  Nothing actually happens; its just 400+ pages of dialogue.  A well-written conventional history of the period would be more enjoyable and more informative.  This is a total snooze-fest 
 This book was a HUGE disappointment for me because I have used the Amazon Recommendations wizard for a long time and this book was the #1 recommendation based on my preferences. How could this book be likened to ANYTHING on my list? The similarities come to a dead stop other than being on the topic of 'child abuse'.   I'm sorry but after reading books like "A Child Called It" and "Happy Like Murderers" wading through this book leaves much to be desired.   I challenge ANY author (Gordon Burns, Dave Pelzer or dare I say... even James Frey!)to go back to the beginning, take their time and do the research and interviews that this story truly deserves... and then write a book that will pay a real and deserving tribute to the lives of all the children destroyed by that monster 
 Obviously Amazon thinks that it's customers can read but not do math! This is the most inane offer yet!! 
 Way way too much science at the expense of what could have been a great story about the vanishing cranes.  I read a lot of excellent literature but this book taxed my brain and not in a good way.  I was sick of all the characters by books end. There was not one redeeming quality in any of them. I simply cannot imagine how this book could win any awards 
 I waited ages to get this Fulci classic and now I wished I did not. It is probably Fulci's most confusing work to date and lacks all known production standards considering this is film #33 from him. I can buy GIALLO being a bit spaced out and highly far-fetched, but this one is just plain bad from start to finish, it is only really remembered for the infamous woman chain whipping sequence (chain whipping also appeared in "The Beyond"; Fulci loved cashing in on all this stuff), "Don't Torture a Duckling" is completely void of substance, mystery or crime and instead is replaced by everything that is camp about film making, from the obvious papermashy heads to the "shall I stand here and act now" type blemish on everyone's face, considering this is Fulci's 33rd film or thereabouts, it really looks like his first and it would be another 8 years before he made horror, I was expecting a somewhat smart GIALLO and got drawn out rubbish instead. Like I said - Watch "The Bird with the Crystal Plummage" GIALLO instead. It was made by Argento two years before this and is where you should be at instead. I would recommend that Argento 'primative slasher' over Fulci's cash crop schlock "Don't Torture a Duckling" any day of the week 
  Apparently, this is a film that many women, who have read the book, can make enjoyable.   Characters, including Anne & the Captain, display wooden acting. Poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in "Pride & Prejudice" 1996 & 2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality.   Both Anne & the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation, and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne's & the Captain's constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness to be responses of: shyness, thought, distance, hopefulness, approval, or alarm.   You understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story's ending.  This film has pretty scenery; such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often very unique and well done. There is beautiful singing in one scene, and even better, wonderful singing over the closing credits.   Good period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women labor to imagine this film better than it is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they continued their fanciful, wishful, thoughts into rating this film. A reviewer, who liked the film, says she had read the book, and she cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film. A poor script for those who have not read the book. Awful directing made awful acting.   I would like to see this good story re-made by a better Director.   Well-made romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree" 
 I remember liking this book as a child and I thought I could get this book for my daughter.  The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that "climatic ending" where the apples all topple - Not there! I wouldn't even recognize the wording in the board book as Dr. Suess's 
 This book was on a very interseting topic. The author took time in studying this topic. It was about the impending world oil shortage. That is the time when we, the world, will run out of oil. It tells you about Hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. They then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. Then they talk about where oil is. They also talk about drilling for oil. They say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. Then they talk about the size of oil fields. They also reexamine Hubbert's analysis later on in the book. Rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. They talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. They also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. Hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody. The author was ver knowledgable and I could tell he knew what he was talking about.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage. I say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring. When you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring. I gave it a low rating because I have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book 
 I don't know what this book was supposed to be, but reading about how someone argues with his wife using Bruce Springsteen's lyrics is a waste of paper. 
 The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product 
 Director:  Jamie Blanks Cast:  Denise Richards, David Broeanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Cauffiel, Katherine Heigl, Hedy Burress, Fulvio Cecere. Running Time:  96 minutes Rated R for strong horror violence, some sexuality and language.  "Valentine", the over-slasherized version of the excellent Tom Savage suspense novel, starts with a pre-teen valentine disco set in 1988. A bespectacled young boy heads on the dance floor looking for a young female to share a dance with. First he approaches Shelly (later played by Katherine Heigl) who embarrassingly rebuffs him. His charm doesn't seem to work with Lilly (Jessica Cauffer), Paige (Denise Richards) or Kate (Marley Shelton) either; they all send him packing quite arrogantly. His luck changes when Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw) actually acknowledges him and the twosome leave hand in hand. They are later caught kissing under a bench by a gang of bullies. In order to save her own self from persecution, Dorothy accuses the youngsters of attacking her and so the gang decides to take their own revenge. They cover him in red gooey stuff ("Carrie" anyone?), strip him, and chase him onto the dance floor where they proceed to beat him up.  Fast forward ten years and the girls are now women; no one is sure what happened to Jeremy (the bullied brat from earlier) as he disappeared after that dance. It's close to Valentine's Day (of course) and they each receive a card signed with a poetic threat to their lives. They soon realize to take them seriously when Shelly is found with her throat sliced. Before long a mysterious masked madman stalks each of them leaving Kate and her boyfriend Adam (David Boreanaz) to work out that she's next on the psycho's list.  The acting is standard horror fare. Denise Richards once again shows us her amazing and wide-range acting talents: Those two large things attached to the front side of her body that we like to call "breasts." David Boreanaz gives a fair performance, but definitely shouldn't give up his day job on the WB's "Angel." Newcomer Marley Shelton can't do much with her underwritten role, and she comes off as extremely annoying and whiny for the most part. The rest of the acting is close to pitiful. Another problem with Valentine is that the characters are all so self indulgent and morally extracted that it's almost impossibility for them to win over the audience. In the beginning they're shown as mockers to any child that's unfortunate enough to be less pretty than their egotistical selves and actually possess a brain. This discrimination continues throughout the movie as they brush off the men who are trying to woo them out on a date, simply because they're not up to their high standards. How can anyone want such pompously arrogant characters to survive? In a typical slasher movie, the `final girl' is usually the shy reclusive type that the audience feels sympathetic towards, like Laurie Strode. These characters have no such power, leading you to believe that the world would be a better place without them anyway.  Director Jamie Banks ("Urban Legend") has proved that he has the potential to become a fair filmmaker; however this is his first feature failure. It's a shame that he couldn't have made more of the talented cast and competent budget, but in the end, Valentine just feels empty. A couple of talented cast members are not really enough to warrant the many obnoxious ones. Cupid certainly missed when he fired the arrow of fortune at this heart.  This one's destined to escape our memories in the not-too-distant future 
 I received my Ph.D. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from one of the best U.S. universities, and for more than thirty years was teaching and researching in the field of solid mechanics.  Before starting the reading of this book, I was in the agreeable mood with the author's that machines can never be human, and that AI will retain (if not forever) for a very long time its name - unreal.  But, now, I am dismayed.  The author unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and physics to support his point of view, making simple topics sound difficult, and making diffcult ones look impossibble.  The inclusion of his strange tilings is strange.  All in all, the book does not make sense. Moreover, his 'Note to the reader' (which is patronizing, arrogant and deceiving), and his Prologue and Epilogue (which are at best cynical) should have warned me not to venture any further.  I cannot help feeling sorry for myself and for several other readers; and most of all, if this is the author's usual way of communicating his ideas, for his students.  Luckily, I did not buy this book; for one person, who could not stand reading through it, dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor 
 The concept of the unit is that you can use your house wiring as the carrier for the signal. The problem with the design is that it cannot overcome the physics of electricity. Netgear does not clearly explain that you cannot push the signal past the homes breaker system in their ads and hence the only way this system works is if your router is on the same circuit as the adapter. New homes break up room/equipment loads into smaller circuits for safety virtually stopping the use of a system like this. My complaint for netgear is that this is not put out there as a significant technical consideration. Although I continued to use their router I had to go wireless to make the system work and wasted money and time getting to the solution 
 Since I am a nurse and doula amongst other titles, I figured I would see what this book is all about and I must say that I was very disappointed in it, including the tv program that was based on this book. This book reminded me of going to a hospital-based childbirth education class, where it only gives you one side of birth- the medicalinized way or no way at all, with intervention after intervention.  It did not describe at all any of the pain management techniques other than medications, nor did it describe or mention homebirth or birth center options, or even doula support.  If you want to know all the current info out there, this book is definately not the one to get. 
 As usual, Robert Duvall's acting was phenomenal - why I purchased the movie - BUT the movie itself was pointless and boring.  My husband and I fell asleep.....when we woke up Robert Duvall's character was dead!  Enough said 
 I can concur.  This cable does not work.  It will put sound out, but no video.  Of course I have set the video to TV out.  That's the first thing I did!  I have tried this cable with two ipods on two TVs.  Nothing 
 this might hold up if you don't put anything but windbreakers on i 
 I have carefully analyzed all the reviews (positive and negative) before deciding to buy this product in order that the right level of expectation may be set.  My need is very simple.  I have almost all hard floors in my house, either tile or hardwood.  So floor keeping is a relatively low maintenance chore.  I know Flip-It serves both as a dry vacuum and wet mop.  Knowing that both dry and wet debris are going into the same place and I want to eliminate the messy task of cleaning out the wet gunk, so I opt to use the cleaner solely as an electric mop.    I like the idea that while it is mopping, the machine can also take care of the small amount of debris that I missed in my "pre-mopped" vacuuming.  It does take some practice to get the machine to do the job right.  Although I don't have the problem of puddles of water as other have experienced, I have other issue such as the cleaning pad kept sliding out.  I find the maneuvering quite exhausting due to the squeegee design.  Also, my finger gets very tired from squeezing the solution release button.  I don't find the cleaning result dramatic perhaps because my floors are normally quite clean.  The machine will not get to the wall edges so it won't eliminate manual laboring.  I'm also not sure if the heating feature does anything to produce a cleaner floor since the water temperature does not felt very warm.  After two days of experimentation, I decided that the machine is going back to the store.  For light mopping, I am going back to my Swiffer Wetjet.  It is cheaper, quiet, lighter, easy to use, and best of all, no cleaning up required. 
 I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. However, in the end, the book's errors just piled too high. It opens well, with the story of Sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world's great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair.  Then, unfortunately, the downward spiral begins. Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way, which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japan's seemingly endless recession have shown). He also frequently takes good basic management techniques, like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway, and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely "Japanese".  Then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false, such as Japan supposedly having the world's best construction technology. (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world, as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.)  Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of "second-hand goods", instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. Plus, Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world's worst overpackaging.)  Reading between the lines, a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. For example, Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. While this can, of course, sometimes be a serious problem, it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves. Japan's consumers, on the other hand, without an accessible court system, are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives. Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored, because they lack any threat of legal action. In another example, Morita praises the "trust" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations. In reality, this "trust" is a death pact, as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies, instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs.  Other than the glimpses into Sony's history and corporate culture, this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of "Japan is going to take over" books that came out in the Eighties. Although, of course, considering all the "Internet companies are going to take over" books that came out in the Nineties, not even this is a uniquely "Japanese" phenomenon.   PS: Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read "Dogs and Demons" by Alex Kerr. 
 This movie is my favorite movie. Ever. I feel terrible giving it two stars. But it gets 2 stars because I am comparing it to the Rhino version, which I also own. I also own the original VHS. I have watched this movie at least once a year since I was 8 except for about 6 years in middle school/HS. I can sit in class and watch it from memory in my head.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION.  If you can't find the Rhino version, this isn't half bad. Its just that that version is much better, and since I have been growing up with older copies, the new one's flaws, minor to the newcomer, are blinding to me. I also am physically unable to watch any of the "Special Edition" Star Wars because of those changes, if that gives a clue to my movie anality.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT.  One complaint is that the VHS had this cool "glitter" effect in a couple of scenes involving energon and Unicron internals. It is present in the VHS, It came out wrong in the Rhino version, and was totally gone in the 20th. Thanks for deleting part of my childhood.  In comparison to the Rhino version:   The remaster is terrible. Mine seems to flicker and have strange artifacts. The colors are totally off. Hot Rod is basically magenta/pink instead of red and his orange is not orange like an orange, it is orange like a cheaply made basketball.  Widescreen is fake. It is a cut fullscreen. I wish you weren't such a liar, Sony.  Cover art: D-. No detail. Looks like whoever does the new show drew it in an afternoon or two. The matrix looks like a honeydew. It would have got an F but Prime is on there.  Very few of the extras were worth it. I bought this for the remaster, hoping for some clean up and a restoration of the glitter effect, and they weren't there 
 With the great business that has been flourishing to serve curiosity for Islam (read: hate for Islam) after 9/11 - this author joins the gold rush. Not only that he couldn't confirm with any evidence of document or other to Al-ahram newspaper that he has been affiliate of Alazhar universitie and earned a degree in Islamic studies there. But the book has many fallacies that can never be the outcomes of a person who studied Islam. I aticipate that the book will follow the destiny  of Norma khouri's book "Forbidden Love, A Harrowing True Story of Love and Revenge in Jordan ". The ethnic aspirations of the author are clear in his tone when speaking about the injustices that are done to his people - the Copts 
 Item worked for one year, three weeks.  Then had widely varing temperature readings, or indications that the oven had reached over maximum temperature (500+ degrees) when oven was set for 325 degrees.  
 I am doing my own hair for my wedding.  This book has a wedding section so I thought it would work.  It did not.  Unless you like the kind of hairstyles that are impossible to maintain and that you only see on a runway model, do not buy this book.  The majority of the styles are odd and not for every day life.  If you are the kind of woman who doesn't believe in spending more than 25 minutes on your hair, Do Not buy this book.  These styles take at least an hour to complete and are very hard to do at all.  There is one good thing about this book.  It does give good advise on coloring and conditioning.  So, if that is what you are looking for, do buy it.  This book led me to believe I was purchasing a hairstyle book.  In reality it is only good for hair treatment, because of the unrealistic quality of the styles that they offer 
 I wanted to find out about modern plumbing (like PEX)and what kind of tools, code changes, etc. that are necessary for installing PEX plumbing.  Not in this book.  That information must have fallen through the cracks (no plumber joke intended).  Author is stuck in the past.  Needs to be updated, revised, or recycled.  Kind of a bummer.  Now I have a book that I can't use.  Sweating copper...come on now.  The rest of us have made it to the 21st century 
  Since 'Gold' is nothing but an inferior rehash duplicate of 'The Very Best Of Marvin Gaye' CD set, I'll repeat most of my previous review here. While the music on this latest compilation is great, it's missing A VERY ESSENTIAL MARVIN CLASSIC....'After The Dance'!! This 2 CD set (nice packaging though!!) is a MAJOR FAILURE without 'After The Dance', and THERE IS enough room for it's inclusion (I remastered the set myself to include 'After The Dance' & more!!).   Also, instead of too many 'filler songs' from the so-so 'Here My Dear' CD, they could've (& should've!) included masterpieces like 'Save The Children', 'Flying High In The Friendly Sky', and Marvin's awesome 'Till Tomorrow' from his Midnight Love CD (1983). The rare track 'Where Are We Going ?' is nice, BUT by releasing this incomplete collection, Motown missed the boat AGAIN!   I advise everyone to remaster this set (with the proper software) & do Marvin some justice, since Motown continues to miss the mark!!! In the end, you'll have a CD set to REALLY be proud of!   GRADE for 'Gold' (a.k.a.'The Very Best Of Marvin Gaye')  Cover Art/Packaging...2 Stars!!  Tracklisting gets...1 Stars!!  OVERALL GRADE...1.5-2.0 STARS! 
 Sorry, Rod, you're still not sexy. And if I had the choice, you wouldn't get any stars from me.  Is he trying to kill music as we know it??  I have listened to a lot of music, and a lot of bad music, but this is by far the worst album that I have ever heard--although I have not heard Rod Stewart Kills Classics Album 1 and 2. It's hard to imagine how he got true musicians like Stevie Wonder and Dolly Parton who have not sold out to participate in the massacre of innocent songs.  Please don't buy this album. It will suck out your soul and you will have to pay nearly $20. 'Easy' listening is a conspiracy to kill all aural audacity and intelligence we have as humans. Instead of listening to recycled festering turds by desperate washed up rock stars that think a back-up band is a synthesizer, pick up something interesting that you haven't heard.  Top-ten suggestions for the anti-this-album:  1. Animal Collective, Feels 2. Aretha Franklin, Gospel Recordings 3. Junior Kimbrough, Most Things Haven't Worked Out 4. Don Byron, Ivey-Divey 5. Nico, Chelsea Girl 6. Lucinda Williams, Car Wheels On a Gravel Road 7. John Cale, 1919 8. John Coltrane, Love Supreme 9. Van Morrison, Astral Weeks  and if you absolutely have to listen to the songs on Rod the Bod's classics albums, an EXCELLENT vocal/instrumental album (which is incredibly soothing but still brilliant) is...  10. John Coltrane & Johnny Hartmann, John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman 
 I purchased two of these and was very disappointed. I could tell no difference. I have 2 dogs and 2 cats and was hoping for a little help keeping the indoor air "fresh." No such luck 
 To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the "songs with lyrics" in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called "Send Me On My Way" by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album "When I Woke". Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song 
 From the start, Trotsky always thought that revolution in any one country could only succeed if it received the active support of revolutions in other countries. But similarly, these other revolutions would also need to receive help from others: the Russian revolution could not survive without a revolution in Germany, but neither could a German revolution survive without a Russian. This mutual dependence meant that no country could ever start a revolution: it would have to wait on the success of another.  So to provoke these indispensable other revolutions, Trotsky was quite prepared to invade other countries. For example, in 1919 he wrote, "A cavalry corps of 30-40,000 horsemen must be formed to invade India." Similarly, at Brest-Litovsk in February 1918, Trotsky made the Soviet revolution's very survival depend on the putative German revolution, risking total defeat by the German army on the throw of a revolution in Germany. He said, "We declare we end the war but do not sign a peace. They will be unable to make an offensive against us. If they attack us, our position will be no worse than now ..." This phrase-mongering did not frighten the German generals, who saw only that Trotsky was refusing to sign the offered peace. They then attacked, as he said they could not do, and seized millions of square miles of Soviet territory, making the Soviet position far worse than before. In the 1930s, the Opposition leagued with Hitler. Churchill wrote, "The German government was in touch with important Russian personalities through the Soviet embassy in Prague. The plot aimed at overthrowing Stalin and introducing into Russia a new pro-German regime. Soviet Russia carried out a merciless but doubtless useful purge of political and economic circles. The Soviet army was purged of pro-German elements." Goebels admitted, "Stalin got rid of all the opposition circles in the Red Army and thus succeeded in making sure there were no more defeatist groups in the Army." The Opposition fought against the programmes of industrialisation and collectivisation that made possible all the Soviet Union's heroic achievements. For instance, in April 1930, Trotsky's Bulletin of the Opposition said, "Put a stop to `mass collectivisation'. ... Put a stop to the hurdle race of industrialisation. ... Abandon the `ideals' of self-contained economy. Draw up a new variant of a plan providing for the widest possible intercourse with the world market." In 1938, Trotsky called for the collective farms to be closed down, and for Soviet enterprises to be handed over to foreign powers.  He consistently called on the Soviet people to overthrow the Soviet government when Hitler attacked. He called for a `revolutionary uprising', an `insurrection' against the Soviet government, when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. He wrote, "the impetus to the Soviet workers' revolutionary upsurge will probably be given by events outside the country." "The first social shock, external or internal, may throw the atomized Soviet Society into civil war." He asked, "Can we expect that the Soviet Union will come out of the coming great war without defeat? To this frankly posed question, we will answer as frankly: If the war should remain only a war, the defeat of the Soviet Union would be inevitable. In a technical, economic and military sense, imperialism is incomparably more strong. If it is not paralysed by revolution in the West, imperialism will sweep away the present regime." "The defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable in case the new war shall not provoke a new revolution. ... If we theoretically admit war without revolution, then the defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable." He wrote, "It would be childish to think that the Stalin bureaucracy can be removed by means of a Party or Soviet Congress. Normal, constitutional means are no longer available for the removal of the ruling clique. ... They can be compelled to hand over power to the Proletarian vanguard only by FORCE." "Inside the Party, Stalin has put himself above all criticism and the State. It is impossible to displace him except by assassination. Every oppositionist becomes ipso facto a terrorist." Trotsky lied to the `Dewey Commission' when he told them that that he had not been organising an underground in the Soviet Union. The leader of Trotsky's Fourth International, Ernest Mandel, openly applauded Boris Yeltsin, the key figure in the counter-revolution that finally restored capitalism in the Soviet Union. He wrote, "The reformer Yeltsin represents the tendency which wants to reduce the gigantic state apparatus. Consequently he follows in Trotsky's footsteps." The Socialist Workers Party backed the US-organised and funded terrorists, which spawned bin Laden, against the people of Afghanistan. "Mujehadin victory will encourage the opponents of Russian rule everywhere in the USSR and Eastern Europe." 
 This was my first Kay Arthur book.  I am comparing it to the impact Philip Yancey's and Max Lucado's books had on me.  I even listened 2-3 times through to make sure I wasn't missing something.  I gained no deeper  perspective of covenant with God, nor was I able to glean anything from the  tapes to make 'practical application' in my life.   Most disturbing was her  reference to Jesus Christ going to hell after the crucifixion.  This is  just not true.  Christ did not 'descend to Hell' to pay any 'debt' we owed.   It was all finished on the cross, thusly He proclaimed, "Father, into  thy hands I commit my spirit!".  Also, the gospel of John records  Jesus as saying, "It is finished".   I cannot recommend this  book 
 Here I thought I had the perfect book for my upcoming journey from Boca Raton to Sarasota via I-75.  It arrives today and I search the pages for I-75 in Florida.  What a downer! I can't understand why the author did not complete his work for the entire distance of I-75, instead of ending it at the Florida-Georgia border. Perhaps he ran out of gas. No matter - Tomorrow I'm returing this book to Amazon 
 This book was hard for me to read.  I actually didn't end up finishing it because I thought it wasn't that well written.  
 If you're looking for fictionalized fluff of how "Rubber"--Mr. Eugenist himself's biographers who write deliberately inspired falsehoods to promote the Bush cause; then here's the book for you!  George and his Skull & Bones cronies -- including daddy Prescott, grandpa Walker, the Harriman's, et al. -- fed this self-alleged war hero from the not always so covert Eastern Establishment's-based silver spoon from an early age. GW is no war hero! He illegally entered the War at too young an age. Then, flailed in the cockpit when multiple eyewitnesses saw "Poppy" George Bush bail on two crewmates sending them to their deaths. Or maybe not? With each election he had set up that he won he'd change his bio and rhetoric to suit the constituents.   Fact many times over tells how father Prescott cashed in on the banking he did to supply the Nazi-killers and the only reason he wasn't nabbed for war crimes like one of his associates was due to one of his other cronies getting the post to pick & choose who got prosecuted.  The story goes on but its not to be found in drivel such as Flight of the Avenger, "Plucky Lad" , "The Family" or any authorized bio of this evil family.   Much of the downright evil can be backed up with diligent research, if you care to look it up in reputable media of the times.  One such book that has much respected documentation is Tarpley's unauthorized biography of this flight [as in abandoning his mates] of an avenger.  Registered Republican 
 Unfortunately TTD went off the deep end on this album.  Consequently he put off many fans from buying the brilliant next album "Symphony or Damn" and the superb follow up "Vibrator". If you loved the first album, give this one a miss and get the two I just mentioned.  Come on TTD hurry up and release a new album 
 In a hurry one evening I grabbed the nearest hairdryer off the store shelf.  Wish I had read some of these reviews beforehand.  This blowdryer has awkward designed buttons that are very hard to turn up or down.  I gripped silently about this aggravation but can no longer remain quiet for the aggravation turned scary when blowdryer stopped working a few minutes into blowdrying daughter's hair.  I waited until dryer cooled and tried again.  I could hear a humming and then the darn thing sparked, a horrible stench filled our nostrils, and then rolling black smoke started coming out of the back.  I wasn't long hucking the thing on the front lawn.  This dryer lasted only about 4-5 months.  A true disappointment in a product that should be built to withstand the job promised 
 i've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD, the sound from my system did seem to be a little better (the CD's were not skipping as much).  but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably, although not as bad as before.  ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk CD changer 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 Oasis sound more and more like a Beatles tribute band who never heard anything past 1967. For people who like their music unchallanging, easy to digest, and predictable. "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" is a Big Mac 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 What a waste of money.  Waste of space. Waste of time.  I'm a fan of both Nick and Jess but you'd be ashamed to own this. Not worth a dime. 
 The three-primary theory that Wilcox maligns in the introduction has been discredited for a hundred years.  But the system he expouses has been around even longer.  Much of the theory in the book is simply wrong.  http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/book3.html#wilcox 
 Dean Cain stars as the marshall of  an underwater mining facility. He arrests some maniac Russian  who later gets out of prison and comes back to get Cain. There's another plot about people on the facility committing suicide but none of it really matters. If the plot sounds thin to base an entire movie on, you're right. There was no reason for this movie to be made, it's basically an ultra low budget rip off of Outland. Since it will cost the you the same at your video store, rent Outland 
 I did not enjoy reading about middle-aged men in the midst of a crisis.  That is what most of the stories are about.  I did not connect or relate to any of the characters.  I was happy that the stories were short because I could not stand an entire novel of such depressing and predictable content.  Yes, this book was well written, however, if that is a large portion of justifying this book as excellent then I would advise exploring other kinds of books;there are plenty of books that are both interesting and well written.  I would mostly recommend this book for men and even then, middle-aged men.  I think this is a better audience for the author's style of writing 
 This book is a disappointment.  It is of some interest to Raider fans, but it doesn't really have much in the way of special information.  However, the first chapter is fantastic.  I'm sure the author's editor told the author to take that chapter out of chronological order and make it the first chapter because it's a great story 
 This book appears to have been thrown together without anyone trying the recipes to see if the results are actually edible, or if all the ingredients we were asked to gather were used. It is frustrating to be told  to mix "all ingredients," then two sentences later be told to put  in another of the ingredients.  This is one example of many. The directions  are sketchy or downright inaccurate. There are so many obvious typos, that  I wonder how many of the ingredients and amounts are accurate or are also  typos. I dislike this book so much that I will not even give it away. What  a waste of money. This book may be good on the "lore" side, but  it is not a cookbook.  I am still looking for a good cookbook tailored to  home storage.  This isn't it 
 This is the second Accu-Gauge tire pressure gauge I have purchased.  The first had very good accuracy and lasted about 3 years.  This one, when compared to three other digital gauges, always shows about 3-4 lbs. less pressure.  
 Just want to say.... we cannot just be "friends" with God, but we have to be obedient, and permissive to what He wants to do in our lives. We can't tell Him what to do, or be "cool" with Him. We have to let him take control of our lives and lead us, He's God.   From the view of Neale Walsch, it seems that we can just "be friends" with God, and that He loves us and will never punish us and that everything will be rosy between Him and us. Well, we are human, we make mistakes and we DO SIN. Sin separates us from God.  And because God sent Jesus His son to die for ALL of our sins and to bring us back to a closeness with God the Father, we can go to Jesus and say we are sorry and ask Him to forgive us and to come into our lives and help us to be better.  But we have to submit to God. We can't do things ourselves the way we want.  THAT'S really the truth people. We can have true PEACE if we do it that way, I assure you. We will continue to make mistakes, but we always have to come before God and tell Him we are sorry we sinned. He will ALWAYS forgive us if we do that. But if we don't, that's when we are in danger of the consequences, whatever that may be. 
 William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation is perhaps the most boring and vexatious book I have ever read.  The plain style employed by Bradford is, undoubtably, because of his Puritan backgroud, but that is still no excuse for the tedious and often archaic redition of events.  I should think that a high-school text book would give a more lively presentation of life in the "New Jerusalem", as Bradford calls it.  The antidiluvian vocabulary and monotonous recording of events made this a very difficult book to get through.  I would not recommend it to my peer 
 This book has inspired me. I figure that if it can become ubiquitous in airports and make the author some money, why can't I write something similar and soak some up? It is probably the worst written book I have ever read. I bought it in an airport, trusting it would be the typical counter-terrorism/spy junk novel that, though pretty banal, would be nonetheless enjoyable.   Although I have managed to suffer through most of its pages (this morning, about 85-90% the way through I through it in the recycling bin, I just cannot take anymore of it), the storyline is not just unbelievable, but simply silly. The dialogue between characters is unreal--surely most of them need to be medicated or at least slapped back into their senses. One moment somebody will be courteous and another they will snap at little, if any provocation. I don't want to spoil it, but something the president asks to pass with congress was comical and I nearly put the book down as soon as I read it.   I think that Brown's writing is about the quality of a well educated and precocious 14 year old, but certainly not a weathered writer. This was the first Dale Brown book I ever wrote and it goes without saying it will be the last. It's a travesty that I had to pay for this tripe.  Let me put it in perspective: I read Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, a book that was ported in theme into a video game on the XBox and it was a far better book 
 It's not what I was expecting. No good for beginers 
 This is the first review I have written in probably a few years.  Normally, I don't feel strongly enough about any product, good or bad, to bother entering a review.  With this new version of Quicken, I have something that I feel strongly enough to write about.  I have been using Quicken for close to 20 years.  I have built all of my finances around it.  For the past 6 years, Quicken has been going steadily downhill.  This latest version, I hope, represents rock bottom.  I don't see how the product could possibly get any worse.  Words cannot describe how bad this product is.  No functionality has been added in the previous 6 years.  What has happened is that the screen has become more cluttered with more links to Quicken's "financial partners", and more redundant links to other, old, program features, and more white space.  In return, the user has to page through tab after tab after tab to view the same information that previously fit on only 1 screen.  Further, each screen refresh now takes seconds, whereas in older versions a screen refresh was instantaneous.  Entering a simple transaction may require this bloated sofware to generate 2, 3, even 4 complete screen refreshes, each one taking maybe 1 to 2 seconds.  That means, once you hit the "enter" key to complete a transaction, you can be waiting as long as 8 seconds before you can move on to entering the next transaction.  As little as 3 years ago the same step required less than a second.  Obviously, time required will vary with your computer - but it is bad enough that Quicken now requires you to "downgrade" your Quicken software every few years - it is also necessary for you to replace your entire computer system at the same time just so you can realize the same performance level as you had in the previous version.  All of this with NO additional features or functionality.  There is a new kid on the block that I am switching to.  It is called "Moneydance".  It can import data from Quicken, it is fast, compact, and runs on any platform, Windows, Linix, Unix, Mac, even OS/2.  It is easier to use than Quicken and the support is great.  It is available for download - a functional evaluation version is free and the full version is only $30.  You can actually speak to a person to get help w/out having to pay.  Since I have been using Quicken for years, it will take a while to test Mondeydance out to make sure it works properly.  I am running the 2 side-by-side for a while to make sure the numbers agree.  So far, things are going well.  Then I plan to dump Quicken forever.  The well has run dry at Quicken; everyone who made the product great has apparently left the company.  Obviously the people at Quicken are free to make their product as bloated and as cumbersome as they want.  But they should not be allowed to force people to downgrade.  Yet, that is what they are doing.  I am absolutely positively through with Quicken, and I am not coming back 
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
 I can't remember the last time I failed to finish reading a novel.  I abandoned this one with 100 pages to go.  With another implausible plot twist, I've had enough.    Maybe I've been spoiled by the quality of character driven fiction from George Pelecanos, James Lee Burke, Robert B parker, James Sallis, Scott Phillips, and Robert Crais but I suspect that this is not just a failure to connect with the characters and more to do with poor writing.  I've read quite a number of Deaver's novels and enjoyed the complex plots and the exploration of psychologically/psyciatrically devient chbaracters, but this is just over the top.  When I came to the chapter that excplained how the magician faked his death while in custody, that was enough.    I have another fifty novels lined up waiting to be read and I'll be damned if I'm going to waste any more time on this poor one.  For that matter, after six or so Lincoln Rhyme novels, I can't say that I really know or care anything about Lincoln or Saches 
 Fox's commentary paints Hildegard as a rather mushy New Age spiritualist.  (Which she was NOT!) The book's only redeeming quality is it's large, full-color reproductions of her illuminated manuscripts 
 Do not, I repeat, DO NOT read this book, as it is totally biased and the author is not an expert on the Middle East as she proclaims. She is not even fluent in any of the common Middle Eastern languages, thus has to rely on either translations or translators, which too are subject to biasness. There is nothing scholarly about this book 
 This item is garbage; I purchased it about a month ago and already dumped it in the trash. Sure it looks and sounds good but take it from me, it's not worth the frustratio 
 This follow up to the brilliant 1983 classic "A Christmas Story" is a pretty disappointing affair. The movie does not hold the same magical quality and nostalgia as the holiday movie. Kiernan Culkin and Charles Grodin taking over for Peter Billingsley and Darren McGavin, were no match for the pitch perfect performances of the latter two. Mary Steenburgen takes over Melinda Dillon's role as Mom. The film deals with Ralphie's young childhood in the 40's. Kind of bland and boring. If your a "Christmas Story" fanatic like me, you will be disappointed as well. It's not a bad movie at all, it's just not what one would of hoped it would've been following the previous classic 
 Terrible, absolutely terrible! "Dancing With Dragons" is more like a Dungeons & Dragons manuel with magickal references to the King Arthur move "Excalibur".  All you need to do is add some cultural references, info on elements and various eclectic Wicca rituals and Voila you have a fluffy book with little substance and relation to occult studies or magical workings.  Oh my goodness I think I will write a poofty Wicca book! I think I could absolutely do it!... Seriously though students and seekers and those experienced in magickal systems, paganisim, wicca or what ever my advice is: Run away just run away...unless of course you desire a good chuckle.... 
 About a year ago I submitted a review of this much-discussed volume, and promised to enlarge upon the subject after giving the regimen and medicaments a fair chance. Several kind souls have expressed their  appreciation for the original review, and asked for any new information I  might have about my person.  In the interest of science, and ridding myself  of the joys of arthritis, I have consumed cubic miles of chondroitin and  glucosamine sulfates; I have grazed upon greens; I have eschewed almost  every eatable, drinkable and smokable damned or even tut-tutted by the  authors - for a while, anyway. I still have arthritis. It does not have me.  If any improvement came about through this Spartan experience it could only  be detected by the most powerful instruments in the known universe. I shall  not, in future, invest in any more of the pills; I have just celebrated my  freedom with a beefsteak, which we discussed over a capital Hermitage, and  topped off with about an acre of gooseberry pie. As I write this, I am  savouring a good cigar. I speak only for myself in this regard, for I note  other reviews and comments diametrically opposed. Well, everyone to their  own taste, as the old woman said when she kissed the cow. Probably I, a  skeptic from the cradle, lack the faith necessary to derive benefits;  perhaps my metabolism is not in tune with the free radicals, or whatever  they are, that do the work.  Pity, as I said before, that a true scientific  test was not conducted by the authors. As presented, 'The Arthritis Cure'  and its offspring give off a decided odour of snake-oil. Anecdotes are  entertaining. Data are convincing 
 Possibility of an Island  Michel Houellebecq set a high conceptual standard with his book, The Elementary Particles, nearly 10 years ago.  Without entering the Science Fiction genre, he was able to do what the Best Science Fiction writers have been trying to do for three generations: Out-do Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World."  The Elementary Particles is a philosophical Tour de Force. If you have not read it, do!  The power of Houellebecq's vision is amazing. But, this venture into Science Fiction style writing is weak. The Possibility of an Island can not be saved by Houellebecq's profound human insight or social foresight. His sarcastic pop culture allusions read thinly like Salmon Rushdie references. The lack of conceptual grasp of technological context demonstrated in the sections of the book placed in future time are a distraction at best and damning at worst.  I chose not finish this book. 
 OK, i'll be first to admit that it's handy to have the book around while i'm playing.  having said that, prima really should've done their homework before putting out this "new and revised" edition.  Or at least put out free addendums on the net somewhere!  If you buy the book, remember that websites like the herald exist that are far more up to date and accurate than this book could ever be.  Spell line info especially.  DO NOT rely on this book for planning your character spec!! 
 They call this a review? you pay 7.95 for the vocabulary words from Cognition the TEXTBOOK! THIS IS MISSED LABELED! IT SHOULD READ CRAM 101 COGNITION REVIEW NOT COGNITION BY MAITLIN. 
 I expected a lot from this CD, but was really disappointed.  Midon feels a bit one-dimensional and I'd agree that there isn't much to "hook" a listener.   A few good songs, and a good listen or two, but not much to bring you back.  
 Butterfly Stories is pretentious and overwritten creating a writing style that presents the reader with prose that is obscure for obscurity's sake.  This was a most annoying and unfulfilling reading experience.  Similar to some of Vollman's other work - this novel is primarily about a man developing unhealthy attachments to prostitutes with Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia as background.  Unfortunately the writing style is so overblown it gets in the way of good story telling. 
 This book blends all of the tediousness of a middle-management PowerPoint presentation with the slipshod history of Oswald Spengler. Too long. No synthesis. And chock-a-block with sexy corporate jargon 
 Dr. Tributsch presents a dense compilation of a huge number of anecdotes of animal misbehavior before earthquakes.  He then presents a discussion, nearly as comprehensive, of the ways cracking rock might produce physical changes in the ground and air to incite the animals.  The layman learns a lot about how animals behave and what bothers them.  The stories come from around the world, and from prehistory up to the present.  Dr. Tributsch is clearly compassionate, and frustrated that few other scientists take his work seriously.  Unfortunately, the theory that pervasive cracking precedes most large earthquakes bit the dust in the early 1980s.  Worse, many of the dramatic precursory phenomena described in ancient literature have revealed no analogs since scientific instruments have been producing vastly more accurate recording of events around the time of recent earthquakes, casting doubt on the veracity of such legends.  So this book is not promising for learning new earthquake science (also, it is now 24 years out of date), and it is too serious for a light read.  Although his theories have not yet exhausted their most ardent adherents, this book is difficult to recommend to anyone outside of the history of science on the wrong track 
 I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, "The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events.  I suggest that readers of "Ahab's Wife" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read.  Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex  is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves.  I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts.  In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish 
 Odder Than Ever is the worst book I ever read. It is a bunch of really really really stupid short stories. One is about a guy who thinks he is gay, another is about a mean father who leaves and never comes back untill his sun find him ruleing an odd world. If you have nightmares after reading scary stories dont read this book. One story is about a kid that gets sucked under his bed into another world and has to be a slave that delivers nightmares in the middle of the night forever. Dont read this book 
 I am an avid reader and I am not sure what to make of the other individuals' assessments of this novel.  I gave it 2 stars because the writing wasn't horible, but I did not see any development in the characters or any compelling reason to become engaged in the story.    Written almost entirely from Lorna's perspective (with the exception of about 5 pages), readers are unable to see any internal dimensions to the other characters.  Even when written from Lorna's perspective, there are no clear dimensions to her character either.  There were attempts to provide depth to personalities, but, in my opinion, ultimately failed.  Instead, I found myself unable to really care what happened to the members of the story. Most people want characters who maintain a level of complexity, whose stories evoke some sort of emotional response.  These characters provided none of these things.  If you want to read a romantic suspense with no romance or suspense in it, then this is a perfect choice.  Even knowing this, I wouldn't get my hopes up. Try a Nora Roberts, Suzanne Brockmann or a Tami Hoag for characters with depth and a story that compells you to not put the book down.  This book just wasn't it 
 ...but not funny. I don't even know how Cheech and Chong fans could like this movie, because this movie is really different from "Up in Smoke" or their other movies. In "Up in Smoke" there was at least some direction to the movie, but in this movie most of it is composed of lame comedy gimmicks that were entirely not funny unless you are high off your ass or have an I.Q. less than 20. They don't even smoke in this movie! The closest thing they do to drugs is eat some marijuana leaves... how stupid do they think we are? Stay away from this one 
 Jean should have stayed dead.  If you read the original stories after she became Phoenix there were many things that she still did as Jean Grey that meant a great deal.  Her and Wolverine had an odd relationship together as he grew to love her and she grew closer to Scott (Cyclops).  She formed a psionic rapport with Scott where they could keep in constant touch and share their love for one another.  They had adventures and the newer team members (at the time) became closer to Jean and fought side by side with her.  She sacrificed herself in issue #137 of the Uncanny X-Men and the readers really felt an emotional loss.  She had been someone we and the new X-Men came to know and care about.  The whole Phoenix Rising storyline and Jean coming back just cheated everyone of that investment in her character.  It wasn't really her that we were caring for and blah blah blah.  That's a bunch of crap because some of those stories from issue #101 (1st Phoenix) to issue #137 (death of Phoenix) were the best in Marvel history.  Jean, the person, was a big part of those stories and saying that it was not really her is just the biggest farce that a comic series has ever pulled.  I know that a lot of characters die and then come back but her death was so well done and played out and led to many other things (Scott leaving, team remorse, etc...) that bringing her back just really left me feeling cheated.  Basically it means Wolverine didn't really love Jean, but some clone or piece of her or whatever.  That's just dumb.  This all leads up to the Inferno storyline that was dismal.  A very weak conclusion to Mr. Sinister/Jean Grey/Madelyne Pryor storyline.  It was a poor poor poor (have i mentioned poor?) decision to raise Jean from the dead.  We had all moved on and had our memories of her and the glory days of the X-Men title.  The decline of the X-Men as a title is a whole other story.  The book stayed good for a few more years after (prob up to the early #200s), and had splashes of brillance here and there (Jim Lee art), but after Claremont and Byrne parted ways there was definitely a decline in the title culminating in the horrible Inferno storyline and the eventual splitting into 2 teams (another bad idea). So are Captain America's original sidekick Bucky and Spidey's old flame Gwen Stacy coming back too? Jean Grey coming back to life was/is a BAD IDEA!! A bunch of baloney! I still call myself an X-Men fan, but I am a fan of the large box full of back-issues I have.  All you younger fans out there (I'm 27) need to read up on the old school and see how great this series used to be 
 I will join in with the others that this book is highly dangerous, misleading,unscientific and just plain awful. I cringe when I see it on a counselor's bookshelf.This book has almost certainly done more harm than good.Please seek professional help before turning to this book 
 Tony Brown's paranoid fantasy about world orders make this an almost impossible book to read.  Not backed up with any facts but the authors claims jump from topics a diverse as the implied assassination of Princes Diana to a general Freemasonary plot to rule the world to the world banking system.  Often these topics are covered in a few pages with Mr. Brown liberally jumping from one topic to another.  His only references are other conspiracy books as bizarre as his own.  Schitzophrenic paranoid fantasies quoting other paranoid fantasies and masking itself as some sort of intelligent thesis.  What nonsense!  But hence the crux.  Since it is a "conspiracy" (a word Mr. Brown uses liberally), it can never be proven or disproven, hence it's validity.  Based on that version of logic one could never disprove the existance of Santa Claus either 
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 Honestly, I like Tony Brown. I enjoyed his PBS show. I listen to him on the radio when I can (WLS in Chicago). But, his books are not nearly as good as I know they can be!  This book deals with his "Mama", a woman who took him in when he was a baby and his mother was neglecting him. She was not a blood relative, just a woman who saw a baby starving to death due to neglect. He lived with her until her death when he was 12. This book is an attempt on his part to honor her and the simple wisdom she taught him. The Seven Core Values are:  1. Reality: The Value of Being Yourself. 2. Knowledge: The Value of understanding your purpose 3. Race: The Value of honoring your humanity (In this case, the only race his Mama was worried about was worried about was the human race) 4. History: The value of investing in the future 5. Truth: the value of being true to yourself 6. Patience: the value of "Keeping the faith" 7. Love: the value of living joyfully.  As in his other book, Brown repeats himself a lot. He quotes a passage from Hamlet 3 times (part of the "to thine ownself be true" speech) as part of his multiple descriptions of his high school English teacher. He lifts two pages from his other book concerning a story about a YMCA opening in his hometown. He says the same thing, over and over, repitiously, a lot. He repeats himself. Yes, indeed, he seems to say something and then say it again. Repititive, he is.  Like his last book ('Black Lies, White Lies), this book is in serious need of an editor. He seems to have written the chapters seperately, without regard to what he had previously written. I like the sentiments and ideas expressed, but, man, it was sometimes tiring to read them.  
 I guess I missed the point. I can see how this film could be considered a horror "classic". I'm sure the violence was ground breaking in 1972... in fact, one of the comments in the "making of" on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres. I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes. If I was craving some good 1970's horror, I'd rather watch "I Spit on Your Grave" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"

 De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make "extralegal" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on.  It's a very important point but de Soto oversells, arguing with exaggerated (and oft-repeated) ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor.   He occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work. For example, he has helped businesses in Peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal, and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes: a useful bit of empirical information, but those gems appear all too occasionally.  Before reading this entire book, I recommend going to the website of de Soto's foundation (the Institute for Liberty and Democracy at www.ild.org.pe) and reading the main point there (in one tenth the words) 
 I ordered the first three books in the series in one go. I enjoyed the first one - it was exciting and different - but then something strange happened, a transformation as colossal as that of man into wolf or wolf into Dire Wolf: the interest wore off! Just like that... POOF it was gone! I just got so SICK of reading about the guys' big, thick c**ks and the women's sensitive c**ts and what not!! FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!! After about the millionth time, the shock factor wore off and I found myself yearning for the euphemisms that used to leave something to the imagination. I just got so sick of her crudeness and believe me, I've never been what one would consider a prude! It just got too repetitive. There just doesn't seem to be much in the romance department. Instead the hero and heroine go at it like rabbits (or wolves - insert applicable wild animal here), decide that they're made for each other and after various porn movie scenarios, (with a few vampires strewn in here and there for added effect), they get married and that's the end of that!  Her stories, in my opinion, would benefit a lot more if she wasn't so determined to have them  shafted (forgive the expression) to the porn section of any respectable bookstore 
 Let me start by saying that the book is very informative.  She's obviously done her research and the details prove it.  Unfortunatly, it seems as though her job at PLAYBOY didn't instantly qualify her to write a nonfiction book about hell.  The book is rambling at best.  It's like when you talk to a civil war historian or something and they cannot keep their thoughts on course.  "And then Jackson moved to outflank the union lines.... funny thing about Jackson..."  She does this often.  Now you may say to yourself: "self, 2 stars seems a little low for just that one flaw"; to which i would respond that it is really, REALLY annoying to read.  If incoherent writing and frequent tangents dont bother you, bump that rating on up to 5 stars. 
 The author uses only English-language sources, ignoring the many important primary documents that have not been translated from Spanish (and Nahuatl) into English. More seriously, he ignores most of the scholarly literature on Motecuhzoma, Cortes and the conquest of the Aztecs. This lead to a big mistake that undermines much of his discussion of Motecuhzoma: Recent scholarship shows that the notion that Motecuhzoma and other Aztecs believed Cortes to be the returning god Quetzalcoatl was a post-conquest fabrication. This changes our understanding of the Aztec emperor and his interaction with Cortes.  The recent scholarship is summarized in: Townsend, Camilla (2003) Burying the White Gods: New Perspectives on the Conquest of Mexico. American Historical Review 108:659-687. For the full argument see: Gillespie, Susan D.  (1989)  The Aztec Kings: The Construction of Rulership in Mexica History. University of Arizona Press, Tucson 
 Hello, I wanted to say that I read this book after I read The Signs, by Canyon Adams.  I have to tell you all that Canyon Adams did a much better job at detailing the identity of Israel and helping the reader understand how it has become the United States and Europe.  If you have money to burn, buy this book.  If  you have money enough for only one book on this topic, buy that book by Canyon Adams because it says more and will actually help you see the whole picture onca and for all 
 I personally did not like this book.  I am pretty new to Access but I am young so I pick these programs up pretty fast.  My work involved some advanced query work for data scrubbing.  The book goes over every single function but does not go into depth about it.  When it described a object (IE: list boxes), i really needed to know how Access stores the data and how i can access it, but the book was no help.  I got a feel for the program's functions but could not use this book as a reference when i was coding.  I wanted to use this book like i used Excel 2003 Bible, with the detail that I could refer too.  Maybe I was looking for too much 
 Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums 
 As far as Cheap Trick cd's go this one is no where near the best, but I would say it is no where near the worst as well.  Underneath all the bad sounding 80's synths, is the heart of a pretty solid cd.  The songs themselves are not bad.  I know it sounds like a broken record (no pun intended), but I can think of no other band that suffered from lousy studio production more than Cheap Trick.  If you were to take away the overbearing 80'e synths, and other stupid 80's sounds, and just strip the cd down to its essentials, what you would have hear is a pretty cool power pop record.  It's Only Love I would say is one of the best song's from their 80's era (and it is the only song on here that escaped the synths and other useless sound effects and what-not).  Name of the Game, has the same drum sound as their version of Terry Reid's Speak Now, from their first album.  It is a song about how repetitive love is over time.  The people are different, but it is all the same, and it never really changes.    Having seen live concert video's from this era, you see how well these songs sound if it was just the band playing and no gimmicky production.  I heard a live version of It's Only Love, and when they hit the chrous close your eyes and you hear Nirvana.  It is what it is.  It is proof that if the band had the proper people on their label in place they never would have sank into the nether regions of the 80's.   Cheap Trick went back in the studio a few years ago with record producer Steve Albini, and re-recorded thier 2nd album In Color.  I think they should leave In Color alone, and Redo this album, only with Tom Petersson's 12 string bass giving it that much needed low end.  Some people might scoff, go ahead scoff.  I suggest if you can play guitar, learn these songs, play these songs, and then you tell me they are bad songs.  I would agree bad production, yep it sure is, but there is nothing on here as insipid as Wild Wild Women or Rock All Night.  Nothing against Jon Brant, good bass player, nice guy, but he brought nothing to the band musically.  I would really like to hear how this would have sounded with Petersson playing his 12 string monster on this.  What this album really lacks is a low end.  I think all post Tom Petersson cd's lacked that low end sound that he brought to the table.  That and he could write songs as well, which made his contribution to the band more vital then just being a mere "hired hand."  Re-record this straight-up raw live in the studio and I promise you the musically illiterate will sit down and shut up.  Oh, and their worst CD...Busted 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 As most of the Revolution Studios movies, "The Wedding Planner" is not a conventional one. You won't find the classic leading lady with the classic leading guy in the classic romantic-and-predictable-as-usual story. And this stereotype-melting effort is probably what catches our attention. To see couples or situations you normally don't see due to social stereotypes and conventionalisms it is certainly a rather interesting exercise. Having said that, "The Wedding Planner" is also really fun movie to watch. Most characters are great (except perhaps Lopez' italian admirer who is plainly lame). And my other serious complaint is: what's with Matthew McConaughey's hair in this movie? It looks so dry and frizzy and so artifically colored! I think they could have afforded to give the leading guy a more stylish look. On the other hand, passing J. Lo as a italian gal is not very believable (I mean). But on the up and up, J. Lo's wardrobe and hairstyling are remarkably beautiful in this movie giving her a tidy, neat and classy look very distant from her usual flamboyant bombshell persona. Overall a nice entertaining light and funny romantic movie to watch. 
 I ordered this CD on May 19 and I have not yet received it.Please advise as to what to do about this. I know I have been charged and I would like to think this doesn't happen very often.  You might know, the first time I order CD's off the net and one of the 3 doesn't arrive 
 Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found the recording of these  so-called adventures irritatingly tedious and trite.  The author never  quite manages to find a pulse in any of her subjects 
 Sorry, but this movie BLEW!  The premise was there, but the delivery just sucked.  I can only take the suspension of belief so far.  We are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf (whom he's been w/for at least a year) about his last, one before that, and gf before that.  At least two of them have his home phone number: they've never called? She's never seen the caller ID?  She's never answered the phone? Give me a break!  THen she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms. She meets up with Joyce (the most recent) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes, and starts believing that the bf should really be with her.  Joyce is none the wiser, but if you ask me, Joyce had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the model, calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone, keeps that stupid boomerang IN A FRAME, etc.    This chick, Stacy (Brittany M) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going. Holly Hunter's character is precisely why I have more male friends than female. Stacy just met this woman and she's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie. I never expected the 'big climax,' but I did ask myself several times "will this Barb (HH) chick back the **** off?!"    On to the climax:it was actually a surprise, but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for Stacy...after she humiliated all those people. I never got the impression that the bf (Derrick) was cheating on her, yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different.  The ONLY reason he pissed me off was because he didn't read STacy the riot act in the end.  This movie tries to wax philosophical, and you just end up hating all of the characters...except for the dog.    A very passible movie.  I wouldn't even bother. 
 Richard is a funny guy. He never can overcome his SCIENTISM and naturalistic reductionism. I wish I could talk to him to help him out (if I were doctor). He needs (1) therapy and (2) to THINK a little more... Dawkins like to use straw-man arguments and does NOT know anything about Christian Theology. I'm truly Sorry for him when he embarases himself with poor representation of something he know nothing about (when talks about religious matters, or even science).  I have also read his article "Science is not a religion" (which is not very good article), and apparently FOR HIM science is a religion...  Usually religious experience involve (a) awareness of the Transcendent and (b) total commitment to It. Dawkins' Transcendant is "THE GREAT SCIENTISM". :D and of course he is commited to it. Not the science, but scientism... Otherwise why would he go around with his naturalistic dogmatism?  
 It is a wonder why I needed another 480P version of this movie.  When you purchase 'blueray' you may think at least 780P but not with this one.  I guess I should have been more careful but with all the hype I assumed the movie would be in a higher def 
 This book is utterly awful. It is filled with fear mongering of the very worst kind. Reading this book made me feel terrible about even thinking about having a second child. The thesis appears to be that having another child will ruin your first born's life. I was weeping by the end of the book and felt utterly terrible. 
 I purchased this book looking for information on specific methods of financing my pre-startup with little of my own money.  I read the book in it's entirety and here is what it is:  A wonderful personal story of winning and losing in business.  It shows that creativity can be used to overcome lack of cash, but gives few useful ideas.  Like I said, it's just a nice story, not a business resource 
 On occasion, in the past, I have learned a couple of good tips from Steve's pbs programs for safe travel, but I have found his travel guides to be as shallow as his tv programs when it comes to learning about a place. If you simply want to visit a country so you can say "I was there and here are the snap shots to prove it" then Steve is your guide...but if you are interested in learning as much as possible from a guidebook before you go and while you are traveling and really experiencing a place, I much prefer the Rough Guides or the Eyewitness guides. The Rough Guides are particularly good at giving "real inside advice" and good history lesson 
 Dr. David Beck is a pediatrician who is still grievibg the loss of his wife Elizabeth, 8 years ago. Elizabeth was supposedly murdered when was kidnapped all that time ago. All this time later as David still searches for clues as to what really happened-appears a message on his computer, It is a warning which reads "Tell No One." Tell no one what though? This writer keeps giving warnings to David, and the next thing he sees is Elizabeth's picture waving at him looking as though she is still alive and well-and maybe she is. But in the process, David is getting framed for strings of murders, as someone is against him, and wants revenge. And this person will stop at nothing to get David, And not only that, but he just knows that Elizabeth is still alive after receiving clues to meet her at a resort.   I thought the book had too many twists and turns at once, and in places was disjointed as well. However, it kept me interested until the end 
 People were talking about this movie as if it were the next Silence Of The Lambs.  There are several reasons why this is not so.  1. The Dumbest Cop In The World:  This character never calls for backup, and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues.  At the end, he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight.  He'd never survive on the Sopranos. 2. It's sooooooo 1998.  This movie assumes you know nothing about the internet.   3. It tries to be cool by combining BDSM, body modification, and rituals, but in the end it just makes all these things look bad. 4. It's inconsistent.  The Dee Snider character "retires" all his piercings for a few years, and then suddenly they're all back in the next scene.   5. It's unrealistic.  Where the heck did Snider get that second dungeon from in just a day? 6. I won't even get into the gaping plot holes.  The acting, pretty bad.  The dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood:  Grumpy.  Amy Smart is totally wasted in this movie.  Snider's pretty good though.  Actually he's really good.  Really, bottom line:  You have only two reasons to buy this movie. 1. You are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a Twisted Sister tour bus through them with room to spare. 2. You're a Snider fan and you must own this.  If you belong to one of those two groups, go for it.  For Sister fans, they'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song Captain Howdy/Street Justice.    You've been warned!  
 What type of biographer gets the birthdate of his subject wrong? Roger Morris's angle on the Clintons was pretty obvious in the opening pages. The tale we were in for was one of compromised values, and unvarnished ambition  without any real ideals. I find the Clintons interesting, even fascinating.  I am not an apologist or even a fan;  I've read books that have both  praised and pilloried them. And certainly, every biographer is entitled to  their own point of view. But I lose all respect when I come across errors,  especially ones so obvious as that which appeared on page 109.  Morris  states that in January 1947 Dorothy Rodham gave birth to a good natured  baby girl. Anyone who has followed the Clintons -- least of all a  biographer who spent over 3 years studying his subjects -- knows that  Hillary Rodham Clinton was born on October 26th, 1947.   That's where I put  the book down, feeling a bit had.  After all, any biographer who could be  so carelessly cavalier with such a basic fact would have no problem bending  impressions, quotes, etc to make his case. Inexcusable. Speaks volumes  about the author, and about the sorry state of publishing right now.   ellenpward@aol.co 
 This program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts. It is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic. The word bubble sdo not rotate, so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to.  It looks really great on the cover of the CD, and that's what sold me. It was a disapointing christmas 
 A wasted effort from one on the most perceptive minds alive. He dropped his past standards on this book.  Only the gems of wisdom about human nature gives it value.  An unknown author would have had this book rejected, or at least criticized.  I agree with the following observations taken from other reviewers:  "The story was all over the place and the ending far from satisfying."  "The first hundred or so pages move at a glacial pace, and the author's disjointed manner of storytelling soon becomes confusing and annoying."  "Far too much of the book took place in flashback... vacillating from vague self-pity to vague longing to vague regret and back... Of the three pivotal characters, two are presented almost entirely in flashback."  "Too dense and slow moving... even though the language is always wondrous."  "...novel seems dark and pointless."  "numbing dive into the depths of one man's self-absorption left me gasping for air."  If you are new to Le Carre, read his earlier works first or you may never read them after this work 
 When i got the gun i took it outside to shoot it and it went about 2 or 3 yards. It is still a good gun for 00.01!!!! 
 This book is drivel. The author teaches you to approach men, chase after them, research their lives and backrounds, etc. I thought it would be an interesting book, but she actually fills the pages with advice like: give  hints to let him know you'd marry him if asked, men don't like white shoes  after labor day, and she even has recipes and word lists!  The fact that  she herself has not managed to snare a millionaire and her mother is  divorced because her own father was cheating tells you just how effective  her advice is in getting a rich husband and happy marriage. If you must  read it, get it at the library, but don't pay for it. I wish I hadn't 
 Don't waste your money. I tried it with my 18 month old and it made him cry instead of go to sleep 
 The best of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book stories took place in the man village because that's where Mowgli meets a superstitious old hunter named Buldeo.   Buldeo claims that the tiger Shere Khan is supernatural,  the ghost of a wicked old money lender.  When Mowgli says that Shere Khan is only a very disagreeable tiger Buldeo threatens to spank our young hero.    When Buldeo learns that Mowgli has a vendetta with the tiger and a black panther as his personal body guard the old man tells the other villagers that Mowgli is a demon child who is able to turn himself from a boy to a wolf, and back to a boy at will.  This is great story telling.  But where is Buldeo?  He isn't in the movie at all!  It's like leaving the Wicked Witch out of the movie version of "The Wizard of Oz".  On a side note, in the Kipling stories the black panther Bagheera has a secret so shameful he can tell no one but Mowgli.   Bagheera was born in a zoo, chained and keep in a cage for the amusement of men.  But rather than blame Mowgli for the cruelty he suffered in captivity Bagheera sees the boy as a kindred spirit.  They were both separated from their own kind at an early age.  Once we have that bit of information the relationship between the boy and the panther makes sense.   We are able to understand Bagheera's total devotion to the Mowgli.  But the movie never explains that.  I realize that the movie shouldn't follow the book completely.   But since the book was so much richer the movie seemed like a let down 
 There are two particular problems here: First, music this minimalist needs lyrics that are incisive or clever or at least interesting in some way. These lyrics are consistently banal and in many cases inane. Second, McCartney's singing voice appears to be tired or ravaged by age or overuse. His lowest pitches (and none are THAT low) sound strained, and his higher pitches, which are mostly taken falsetto, sound thin and weak. His intonation is generally faulty; he is often painfully out of tune. Oddly enough, his singing seems to deteriorate as the record wears on, almost as if it had been recorded sequentially in one session, as I doubt it was.   There are chord relations in the first three songs (although only briefly in the first) that I never expected to find in a McCartney song. Possibly someone finally pointed out to McCartney that John Lennon's and George Harrison's Beatles songs were generally much more harmonically adventurous than his and he is seeking belatedly to even the score or possibly he is letting himself be influenced by David Bowie or by people who were themselves influenced by David Bowie. The opening of each stanza of "This Never Happened Before" ("I'm very sure/this never happened to me before") derives directly from Burt Bacharach, and McCartney unfortunately lacks the compositional technique to develop Bacharach's motive--or else he's too lazy to try. "A Certain Softness" is more or less reminiscent of Thomas Dolby's reading of "I Scare Myself" or perhaps of Brian Ferry going thirties-Latin. An otherwise pleasant-enough melody is destroyed by singing so out of tune on the critical last line of each verse that it is nearly impossible to tell what pitches were intended. "Follow Me" surrounds with filler some bits taken from George Harrison songs.  The best things about this record are Joby Talbot's tasteful, unobtrusive string arrangements and the remarkable clarity with which it has been recorded. There ought to be a law against letting McCartney touch a fipple flute, however. He murders the instrument on "English Tea" just as he once murdered it on "Fool on the Hill". The liner notes tend to be very specific--fussy, let's say--about instruments played, and although I think a "A Fine Line" one of the better songs, I'm a little saddened to learn the piano that McCartney is beating up here--banging out chords on--is an expensive, refined, and delicate Bosendorfer. Speaking of beatings, the booklet-back lengthy paragraph admonishing us not to make copies of this record (which I notice below is being blithly ignored) includes this sentence: "By [sic] carrying out any of these actions it [sic] has the same effect as stealing music." I don't know who is responsible for mangling the English language in this way, but I shouldn't be surprised to discover it to be the author of the lyrics on this disc; I find a stylistic consistency 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 The reason many of us fail to succeed is that we buy into common sense.  This book does just that by reinforcing bad practices.  It suggests that one should save and invest wisely.  There is little way in which a person could achieve significant wealth by this method though perhaps a good retirement.  The most successful people do not follow this method.  I am pretty well off myself and I can say I did not follow this method and had I, I would not be doing so well.  Unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth (not that I know of).  Compare the wealth of Richard Branson versus Donald Trump - two very different approaches without few similarities.  My mother followed this approach and ended with just a small savings.  The story sounds appealing until you realize that it is fiction - there was no such man and that should speak for itself.  
 As a shaman myself I was appalled when I began reading this book only to discover that entheogens--THE VERY SOLE FOUNDATION FOR SHAMANISM ITSELF--are not mentioned once--not once.  Somehow this book is 600 pages of information about shamanism while not informing the reader of its actual basis.  What a blunder that this is supposed to be a definitive textbook on this religion and some poor people have read this book and considered themselves learned in shamanism.  It needs to be taken off the shelf 
 Up until I moved on to other authors, I had read pretty much everything Mercedes Lackey had written. My opinion is perhaps a bit biased now, since I'm no longer interested in her writing (and cringe somewhat when I read it); however, even back when I really loved what she wrote, this book never worked for me.  I'll try to avoid repeating what others have said, so except for the first point this will just focus in on some of what stood out to me. First of all (this one has been mentioned, but I wanted to underline it), I'm not sure how accurate it was as far as Native American beliefs and practices. If someone who is a Native American from the specific people group the main character hailed from would like to comment on this, I would be most interested (let's not get any more "Education of Little Tree" type books out there, shall we?).  Next, one of the things that annoyed me was the treatment of sex. Now, this is certainly at least partly based on my feelings towards sex in general as being something meant for marriage only. However, I got annoyed with the way that Jennifer's grandfather felt that sex would solve all of her personal problems (okay, maybe not ALL of them, but still). From my real life observation, if someone is stressed and dealing with all sorts of personal issues, sex isn't going to be anything more than (to paraphrase someone close to me) a bandaid covering up the splinter so you don't have to actually take the splinter out (i.e., a "solution" that lets you avoid the real problem). You might feel better for a little while, but it's not going to fix things. And considering the way things were between her and her former lover, I wasn't convinced that sex would help. Rather, I thought it would confuse things. They had reasons for breaking up, reasons that I didn't feel were fully dealt with. Jumping back into bed with each other wouldn't solve her problems, it would make them that much more painful a few [months, years, or however long it took] down the road when they had to break up again because they hadn't fully figured out whether they should be together or not. This is one of my main issues with Lackey's books; she uses sex far too lightly, without generally looking at some of the consequences that come in real life.  Finally, here's my biggest issue with this book (which also ultimately became one of my issues with Lackey's writing in general). In this book she seemingly bends over backwards to be openminded and fair towards people of all races, genders, religions, etc. She in fact states this several times in case the reader didn't get the point; everyone should be accepted, have equal rights, etc. So if this is her belief, why is it that EVERY SINGLE WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) male is an abusive, heavyhanded, racist, sexist, etc. jerk? (and I'm not 100% sure on this, but I seem to remember that every WASP female was abused, timid, and frightened, although generally wanting to be good) I know that WASP males have caused a lot of damage in the world; however, they aren't the only ones, and there are plenty of them that are great guys (and honestly, at this point in time, pretty much the only people groups out there, at least in any large numbers, are those who at one point in time in history conquered [and frequently did horrific things to] other people groups. WASPs just happened to be the most recent, and most successful worldwide, at doing this). This annoyed me so much that I couldn't appreciate much of the rest of the book.  So there you have it. Some aspects of the book were alright, but unfortunately they couldn't outweigh these negative issues for me 
 i had a good experience with 80s purple last year, so when i needed prop glasses i knew where to look. i got my order, the glasses were scratched and the frames were damaged. i called and they said they would send me a replacement right away, i was quite pleased. it has been over 3 weeks and i have not received them, i have called and emailed them several times with no response. not even picking up the phone. i plan on contesting the charges on my card and will not be shopping here any mor 
 The DSM IV-TR is a great book to promote diseases that fit the armaments of medications that the pharmaceutical companies would like physicians to use.  The problem with the whole DSM serie is that it is mostly subjective and based on speculation. The DSM is not based on hard empirical evidence but on a consensual system by few well-connected psychiatrists on the payroll of the pharmaceutical companies working only as "consultants" to avoid conflict of interest, which would allow them to continue to receive the loot. These same psychiatrists also happen to belong to the American Psychiatric Association and/or work as hired guns/consultants for the APA, which also happens to receive yearly funding or gifts (disguised as continuing education) from the pharmaceutical companies $500,000 worth.  The whole process is deceitful and shameful!!!  Please check the Washington Post article on 04-20-06 titled:  "Experts Defining Mental Disorders Are Linked to Drug Firms." It will validate what I have been exposing for a long time. Also attached below the absrtract from the study:  "Financial Ties between DSM-IV Panel Members and the Pharmaceutical Industry Lisa Cosgrovea, Sheldon Krimskyb, Manisha Vijayaraghavana, Lisa Schneidera  aUniversity of Massachusetts, Boston, Mass., and bTufts University, Medford, Mass., USA Address of Corresponding Author Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics 2006;75:154-160 (DOI: 10.1159/10.1159/000091772)     Key Words *	Conflicts of interest  *	Ethics  *	Financial interests  *	Psychopharmacologics Abstract Background: Increasing attention has been given to the transparency of potential conflicts of interest in clinical medicine and biomedical sciences, particularly in journal publishing and science advisory panels. The authors examined the degree and type of financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry of panel members responsible for revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM). Methods: By using multimodal screening techniques the authors investigated the financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry of 170 panel members who contributed to the diagnostic criteria produced for the DSM-IV and the DSM-IV-TR. Results: Of the 170 DSM panel members 95 (56%) had one or more financial associations with companies in the pharmaceutical industry. One hundred percent of the members of the panels on 'Mood Disorders' and 'Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders' had financial ties to drug companies. The leading categories of financial interest held by panel members were research funding (42%), consultancies (22%) and speakers bureau (16%). Conclusions: Our inquiry into the relationships between DSM panel members and the pharmaceutical industry demonstrates that there are strong financial ties between the industry and those who are responsible for developing and modifying the diagnostic criteria for mental illness. The connections are especially strong in those diagnostic areas where drugs are the first line of treatment for mental disorders. Full disclosure by DSM panel members of their financial relationships with for-profit entities that manufacture drugs used in the treatment of mental illness is recommended."    
 As can be judged by the positive reviews given to this book, Shahak had played into the hands of anti-Semites and pseudo-scholars alike - if it wasn't his intent for writing this book in the first place.  Amongst a great number of other instances of intentionally concealed anti-Semitic attacks masquerading as an instance of objective analysis are:   *Claiming that Maimonides was an anti-black racist.  Shahak deliberately fails to mention the fact that NOT holding racist views of the black race was a very rare occurance in the 12th century Europe and Asia amongst ALL ranks of society.  *Claiming that Jews permit adult sexual relations with minors.  This is a very popular slander amongst anti-Semites used against Jews; needless to say, this is a completely false allegation that has no grounds in the Talmud.  Actually, the Talmud discusses whether the victim of such activity, which is expressly FORBIDDEN by Judaism, should be considered virgin at the time of their marriage.  *Claiming that the Talmud treats gentiles abusively and providing passages from Talmud as evidence.  Shahak, like all other anti-Semites in disguise, fails to mention that such laws were originated by gentiles, and officialy vindicated by European law, AGAINST the Jews living in Europe, who then adopted similar laws to vindicate themselves.  Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.  Apparently, Europeans used Christianity's teachings to live an ascetic life as an excuse to cover up their jealousy of Jewish success and endlessly persecute them.  I could go on exposing Shahak for who he really is, but I simply don't need to, as I expect and hope that these three examples will suffice to convince any potential reader of this book that its content is neither objective nor productive to expanding your view of the Jewish faith as it really is. 
 Although this book gives the reader much useful information on GSM, the style is poor and and needs editing by Artech House.  when I first read the book I got out my marker pen and delated large sections of useless text.   The explanation of Channel Coding and Signalling, 5.14.4, started by saying  'The passengers (user data) in an airplane may have all paid full fare, the  plane may be safe, and the accomodations exceptional, but nobody is going  anywhere without the a pilot and crew (signalling data).  The book is still  in my bookshelf as it is a handy reference manual on GSM, but I am sure  there are better books on GSM out there 
 I ordered 2 wristlets - a brown and a leopard print. I was sent TWO brown wristlets, the return process was difficult, and when I returned the product I DID NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR THE CORRECT PRODUCT!! 
  This is a nice item to add to a collection of D&D trinkets, but in NO WAY is good. It is lacking in story and acting. A lot of the scenes were pleasant, but I was never "compelled" by the story.  I would only recommend this to a hard core collector or a funny break from your current game.. 
 The book is only 90 pages.  The price marked right on the book is $2.99 yet Amazon charges $4.99.  Absolutely not worth the money 
 Mr. Eagleton does little more than repeat stereotypes. Overall verdict: dull 
 I've been doing business in China for more than 10 years.  I believe most readers would benefit from reading some other books ("China, Inc." and "Chinese Business Etiquette", old and revised, but still a great basic resource, and the HBR's "On Doing Business in China").  As I drag myself painfully through "China Streetsmart", I can't help to wonder if Mr. Chan decided to spin a piece of quickly put together stories hoping his last name would sell the book. 
 I actually only read this book because my daughter came home from school claiming that her teacher told her Jesus was the reason that we have candy canes. Apparently, to my extreme dismay, the public school system thought it would be a good idea to read this story a group of first and second graders. No disclaimer was read to them or anything, and my daughter was convinced that this story was definite fact because her teacher said so,  and I had to sit down with her and explain that this story did not have any real connection to fact and show her information that showed exactly where the candy cane came from, and prove that it did not have a religious background at all. I plan to speak with my daughter's teachers and find out why such religious propoganda is being read to my child in an educational environment, but I wanted to make sure that I also posted a review online. Sure the story seems cute, but a very young girl, alone with a stranger, distributing candy in the name of religion, is just not my idea of what I want my daughter to hear about. I would prefer if this type of sharing was kept to people's homes and not distributed in my daughter's school. As we are not Christian, it is hard enough to try to teach my daughter about our own traditions without adding the confusion of a teacher telling her otherwise. THIS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL CLAS 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 I have this dispenser in an area where it only gets used once a day.  It takes 3 activations even at the max setting to get enough soap to wash your hands.  If you let it sit without using it for a couple days, it takes 1-2 activations before any soap at all comes out.  Performance degrades further as amount of soap in dispenser decreases.  Soap in it is Dial antibacterial.   A mechanical dispenser would work better than this 
 I hated this book so much. I though Meredith was completely weak for marrying another man that she did not love just because she was too scared to make it on her ownn. And I thought it was unfair her to let another man raise Cy's child. I actually felt bad for Cy not Meredith. This is the first Palmer book that the heroine came back to the heroe after sleeping with another man 
 Wolin is interpreting Heidegger to show how his philosophy can be used by or sympathetic to the Nazi movement.  He is by no means simply analizing Hiedegger's thought.  This is an interesting critical approach to Heidegger's thought, because he does have tendencies that can be interpreted as dictatorial and nationalistic.  However Heidegger also has tendencies of pluralism and ultra-democracy.  To be critical of his tendencies towards dictatorship and nationalism is a valuable project, especially since he seems to lean in these direction as opposition to technocracy, globalization, specialization.  This, and may of the Americans who write on this, is not a productive approach to the problem.  His critique seems to mask an attack on Heidegger's thought as well as all those who have come after him in the continental tradition.  It is not truly critique, it is witch hunting.  The tone betrays his overall dislike and attack on European late modernists and post-modernism.  Derrida criticizes Wolin saying that it appears that he has never read most of Heidegger's works.  The meaning of this comment is not that Wolin has never read Heidegger, but that he read him in order to interpret Heidegger as a Nazi and then dismiss him and all of his successors.  For Derrida reading is either to think the thoughts as the writer thought them or to interpret the writing in a productive way- both are deep reading practices.  Wolin does neither as he deal with Heidegger 
 If you are looking for an account of the complex chain of events, discoveries and philosophies leading to the emergence of the modern scientific worldview, this is the wrong book. It is heavily influenced by post-modernist views, whereas science is seen as a "discourse" no more or less valid than "alternative" modes of knowledge. Since this is plainly incorrect, the book fits the facts to the Procustean bed of "theory" to support its thesis. For instance, never is the book is the development of Calculus mentioned, clearly an essential step in the development of classical mechanics and the foundation of most modern scientific theories. The same may be said for countless other developments which are cavalierly ignored. There was a scientific revolution and its effects are all around us, including the medium on which this review is written 
 This book offers nothing in the way of practical information.  It may be inspirational to some, but it should not be advertised as a yoga book if it hardly deals with the subject.  A more appropriate title you ask? A Book of  Boring Pictures And Useless Sayings or How to Waste $25 
 First, I want to say that this is another book that tells you how to eat healthy.  Many of us who are overweight know how to eat healthy - we just don't do it.  We are addicted to our ice cream, sodas, sugar, etc.  Forget buying this book if you & your family like beef, pork, lamb, veal, etc.  On this "way of eating" you are allowed chicken, turkey & fish.  (Most of the people in my family are not fish eaters, including me, and especially talapia, which is the fish that is recommended in the recipe section of the book.  Talapia tastes like dirt to me.)  Therefore, if I were to follow the instructions, I'd be serving only chicken & turkey.  Dr. Katz's research seems sound, and I agree that the food industry has succeeded in "addicting" us to sugar and over-processed foods.  I intend to try some of the recipes (they look pretty good) and I also intend to cut the junk food out of my diet.  I've already cut out white bread.  Dr. Katz says that our appetites are lulled by flavor consistency.  So his theory is that if you eat the same flavor during the day, your brain will turn off the hunger and you will be satiated.  So, the first day you incorporate raisins & currants into your meals, the next day, apples, the next, pineapple, and so on.  I really would have tried it, but my family likes other things besides chicken & turkey!! 
 Very disturbing book--on several counts. The flash backs in her other books orovided insight into the characters--how Beatrix had almost reached the point of no return, how Ian became a vampire, and why the poor guy needed counseling. All the flashbacks in this book provided was the fact that Stephan is a "bottom" without enough preservation to have a stopping point. I liked Ann, and I liked Stephan--in spite of the fact that he's an idiot. I wish Squires had spent more time on why someone who has lived for over 2000 years is too self-destructive to realize the so-called good guys are doing a head game on him.  Ann figured it out and she's been in an isolated area for 25 years. I also wanted more on Stephan's past--she dropped just enough hints to be annoying. On the whole, I thought two potentially good characters were wasted on nasty, destructive rape scenes 
 Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version.  (For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM) 
 OK, so the title track is a great song, cannons and all, and Inject the Venom and Put the Finger on You are both decent rockers. The rest, however, is the sign of a once-good band now simply sticking to the formula that brought them success. Consider the following: Virtually every song on For Those about to Rock We Salute You is a midtempo heavy rocker about sex. Virtually every song on Back in Black was a midtempo heavy rocker about sex. Same with Highway to Hell, and Powerage, and Let There Be Rock, and... well, pretty much every AC/DC album. But while those albums were great, this one sucks. Just look at some of the cliched song titles: Let's Get It Up, Evil Walks, Spellbound.. 
 I have really enjoyed the other Llewellyn series books that I have read thus far.  Unfortunately, I can not include this one in that group.  I was really disappointed.  The writer spent the first half of the book constantly repeating what he'd written in the sentence, paragraph, or page just before.  He also spent way to much time going into discussions that would better be suited to an historical(only)study on the subject.  Very little of this book actually dealt with the Beltane/May Day holy day.  The writer also spent a lot of time writing about the 'supposed' sacrifices, evils, etc. done by ancient pagans - something that took me by surprise, as Raven is actively involved in the Wiccan Ways 
 I agree with the other reviewers; this book is full of factual errors, typos and grammatical problems, and cheap pseudo-psychoanalysis. Stewart deserves better than this hack, and I'm sorry I bought the book 
 I loved this player until the day I really, really needed to use it for recording, when I discovered that the MODE button no longer worked. This is the button you need to use to switch from mp3 player mode to voice record, line-in record, or FM radio.   The device is now permanently stuck on mp3 player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat, which is not the worst thing in the world, except that I specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. And 14 months after I bought it, too; conveniently post-warranty.  The screws holding the case together are impossible to remove, so there's no way to attempt a DIY solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device-crippling problem. This thing is of no use to me now; a $200 paperweight. I'm never buying another iRiver product again 
 Several times during my reading of this book I said to myself, "This is one weird kid."  As so many other people in these reviews stated, Jonathan Schwartz is a great singer and DJ with a huge knowledge of his subject.  But he comes across to me as thoroughly unlikeable in this book.  A good deal of the book talks about how terrible things have been , yet he never lacked for money.  His dad and stepmom may have been quite odd (or eveil, in his stepmom's case), but he never lacked any material things.  Speaking of odd, didn't they take pictures in the Schwartz house?  None are in this book, I would have liked to see some of his dad.  BTW, didn't Jonathan have one friend in any of the schools he went to?      
 This book was a lot of Christian "fluff" with no substance (Christian or otherwise).  There are no steps.  There is no plan.  Do not waste your time or your money 
 The VP's wife wrote a Pro-War book and reads it at Christmas time to her grandchildren?  Let's see, we celebrate Christmas as being the birth of Jesus, who's father (GOD) by-the-way, sent down the TEN commandments, one of which is THOU shall not kill. . . .and THIS book is about WAR which , if I'm not mistaken is about killing.  So, what's the connection here?  No wonder kids grow up with so many psychological and moral problems today, because the ADULTS are so messed up!  Way to go Lynne 
 the title of this book should include something that reveals that it is based on and promotes evangelical christianity.  So, if this is your point of view, it is a great book for you and has some good practical ideas along with the evangelical focus. If this is not your point of view and you aren't interested in preparing your daughter to argue against evolution, if you aren't interesting in instilling in your daughter the evangelical point of view on social issues, then you would probably be more satisfied with a book that avoids this religious viewpoint 
 I purchased this book after seeing the 5-star reviews.  I was so disappointed after reading it that I checked the reviews again to make sure I'd purchased the correct book.  I shared it with ten of our holiday party guests to invite their feedback before giving it to my children in case I was somehow missing something indeed worthy of praise.  All agreed that this was a disturbing book for children that serves more to add to their existing ideas of what's scary, has no advice on dealing with these fears and offers nothing to promote their self-confidence.  After reading the book without realizing any of us were discussing it, my teen nephew even commented "wow, this is downer."  It's being returned.  There are far better books to purchase 
 I was disapointed when I downloaded it and got 8 pages. As a customer, I expected to have the digital version of the full book and not a summary. I thought that the price difference was due to the absence of paper, printing, handling, shipping, etc. The hardcover version is more than 300 pages; if you take the price per page of the digital version, the hardcover version should cost then ten times more!!! All the examples are referred to that version and nowhere I was said that I was paying 5 dollars for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT.  I honestly believed that I was buying the full book. I will think better before ebuying again... 
 only in very small letters, INSIDE  the book, they say it is "THE ARMCHAIR DETECTIVE 2". Since I allready had that book, now i have two copies of the same book. VERY BAD PRACTICE OF THE PUBLISHERS. DONT BUY IT IF YOU ALLREADY HAVE THE ACD2 
 Atrocious Compilation - it's of some of the worst films the Coens' did (excluding The Big Lebowksi) and does not include their most famous films.  What were they thinking?  It's like if they released a Spielberg Compilation but only included Catch Me If You Can, AI, Minority Report, and War of the Worlds.  WTF!!!!  Plus you can buy each DVD separately and come UNDER the asking price of the entire set.  The BIg Lebowski and The Man Who Wasn't There are about 10 bucks new in most stores.  Blood Simple and Int. Cruelty (which is the most UNCoen film ever) are closer to 5 in many places I've seen.  So don't fall into the "compilation trap" because you are not getting a "bulk" discount.  Just buy the films you want separately.  Most Coen DVDs are very reasonable price wise.    Any Coen compilation without Fargo, Barton Fink, and Raising Arizona is worthless.   And again, you're better off spending $40 on those DVDs individually.  
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 I never actually received "When Strangers Meet".  What I actually received was "Beyond the Horizon" which I already own. I then needed to return "Beyond the Horizon".  Someday I hope to actually own "When Strangers Meet".  But I'll probably buy it at a CD store so I can actually see what I am purchasing 
 This is possibly the worst textbook I have ever read.  The chapters and discussion of the topics are very long-winded and difficult to understand.  You learn by example but this text has almost no examples in it and those  that it does have seem to only confuse you more 
 I was really hoping to find some great information and insight into unschooling with this book.  What I found was one woman's narrow-minded opinions about parenting.  The foundation for her strong opinions appears to be a traumatic childhood, a few 1970's books on unschooling, and the experience of raising her only child.    She is extreme and harsh in her judgments.  Nothing stated in this book is backed by any sort of data.  If you actually look up her daughter online, you will find a woman who is unsure about her radical upbringing.  The daughter does not view the experience with the same nostalgia and romance as her mother.  Needless to say, I think this book was a disaster.  If you are looking for a very extreme viewpoint on unschooling presented as one woman's memoir, than this is the book for you.  If you are looking for some genuine insight and information on unschooling, I would look elsewhere. 
 I initially only wanted to order "compact disc",by "public image limited" but amazon had a deal if I also orderd "flowers of romance", by the same band so I thought why not, I orderd both c.d.s' but I only recieved "flowers of romance",and not the "compact disc".I paid for both and only recieved the one 
 First of all, consider the question that Lewis is trying to ask. What went wrong with the 'Middle East' and their 'failure' to modernize? And now think about how big this book is, about 150 pages. The 'Middle East' is a huge area extending from Morocco to Iran and he attempts to explain their 'failure' to modernize by reviewing the last years of the Ottoman Empire. That is just plain lazy work on the part of a historian who is supposed to be revered in his field.   Another issue is that he constantly refers to the 'Middle East' as 'Islam' as though Islam is homogenous or even centered in the Ottoman Empire. Granted the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was also the Caliph but the Twelver Shi'is don't consider him to be legitimate anyway. To consider Islam to have some kind of collective thought process when encountering the 'West' is reprehensible. Consider now the fact that the majority of Muslims don't even live in the Middle East or the Ottoman Empire. How can Lewis truthfully use the term 'Islam' in his book to refer to the entity that 'went wrong' when the area he's speaking about doesn't even constitute the majority of Muslims in the world!?   This book is a quick read for people who aren't in the field to think that they're informed about what is going on in the scary area known as the 'Middle East'. The worst part is that the only people who would know that this is full of holes and lacking greatly in background and professionalism are the people who wouldn't normally read it anyway. This is a dangerous book because the name Bernard Lewis is synonymous with Expert in Middle East affairs. This was a lazy, half hearted attempt to cash in on people's ignorance and only perpetuates the wrong ideas in people's minds. Bad Lewis, very very bad. Any 'liberal historian' who suggests this book should be beaten with this book, unfortunately for us the book is very thin so it will take a while to bring him down with it.  If you want better sources, look to John Esposito, Albert Hourani and Nikki Keddie. All of them have published widely and lack the obvious political biases of Bernard Lewis. Check them out. 
 Great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it's free - but not worth your money to own. I bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here. Oh, once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine, but not consistently. The home section isn't that inspirational either. Go for it if it's free, but if it's not, don't buy it 
 Other than the chapter on the Driods, this book is not worth your time.  Better to read Kip Thorne.  How the author could have taken such interesting subjects and made them some uninteresting is somewhat amazing.   Don't read this 
 This book is little more than a meandering list of obtuse, random literary references on the word "Manliness". I must admit that after the first couple of chapters I could not force myself to press on and read the whole thing. It is as boring as reading a train schedule.  I did skim the book to see if the rest of it follows the same pattern of random references with no interpretation. It does.  I did read the final chapter to see if the book comes to any conclusions. It does not.  The idea for the book is interesting, but the book itself is full of padding and fill 
 I was expecting much more out of this 2 volume set. The books are full of mistakes, especially in formulas. If you plan on purchasing these books, make sure to download and print out the errata as well. It could save many headaches in trying to understand formulas that don't agree with the accompanying explanation. I don't doubt that Glassner is a very intelligent man, but his descriptions are somewhat dense and difficult to decypher sometimes. My recommendation: get an ACM SIGGRAPH membership to get access to many of the papers in this field and get the algorithms straight from the source 
 The code examples in this book simply do not work. You have to rely on other books and looking up things yourself on the internet to get the examples working. If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have bought THIS book!!  Its thourogh in its coverage of DX9, but so are a lot of other books that have code that actually compiles. Don't waste your money. A programming book with programming examples that don't actually work is like a cookbook without any actual recipes. Useless 
 I read through this book in a few hours. I was thinking it was an "okay" book untill I got to the supplement section. I felt like it was a commercial. The author kept mentioning his favorite brands, which was usually one brand in particular. I wasn't surprised to see a magazine-style add in the back of the book for that brand. I have a hard time considering the recommendations credible when they are advertizing a body-building product. I also bought "Scrawny to Brawny" It took me over a week to read and the info is waayyyy better in my opinion!  There was a good section that explained how to properly to the exercises which is the best part of the boo 
 This books contains just about everything you will need to FULLY understand the implentation of tcp/ip on a unix based computer.  But if you are like the 95% of people in the computer world, you are running windows, and this book contains nothing regarding its implementation on a windows system 
 Whoever the Engineer was on this 2ble CD, they must have an IQ of 2020 and the worst hearing ever. The sound on this 2ble album is totally abysmal. I bought this because of all the tracks what I didn't count on was the awful sound. Be smart, by the latest version of their one CD Greatest Hits album, the sound is fantastic on that. Why these morons didn't use that sound on this album is beyond me. 
 If you were tempted into buying the book by its title, expecting to find detailed information about Nazi policies against the Polish gentile population and its suffering and dying, you will be badly disappointed. Only the first chapter, entitled "The German Occupation of Poland", which makes up a full 39 of the 219 pages of the book's main part, deals with the subject matter of the books title, The Forgotten Holocaust. Although it addresses every realm of Nazi brutality, from the executions of members of the "intelligentsia" over mass expulsions and deportations to the concentration camps, the reader still doesn't know at the end of it how all the horrors described add up to the horrendous death toll of the Polish Gentile population (out of 5,384,000 victims of prisons, death camps, raids, executions, annihilation of ghettoes, epidemics, starvation, excessive work and ill treatment, 2.9 to 3.2 million were Jews and the rest were Gentiles). Such a detailed breakdown is essential information that a book entitled "The Forgotten Holocaust" should absolutely contain. Instead of providing it, Lucas leaves the reader with the single reference in the notes to this chapter (no. 174) that "Most informed estimates place the loss of Polish Christians at 2.8 to 3.1 million and Polish Jews at 2.9 to 3.1 million". He then dedicates five chapters to "The Polish Government and the Origins of the Underground", "The Military Underground in Operation", "Civilian Resistance and Collaboration", "Poles and Jews" and "The Polish Government, the Home Army and the Jews". Chapters five and six have a certain relevance because they do away with the myth that the Poles were mostly collaborators of the Nazis in the killing of the Jews or grinning bystanders. As for the other three: Is this a book about Polish suffering under Nazi occupation, or a book about the organisation, politics and activities of the Polish underground? Chapter seven contains an account of the Warsaw Uprising, the repression of which was the greatest single Nazi atrocity of the war - certainly gripping, but I read a better account of that tragedy in Earl F. Ziemke's "The Soviet Juggernaut" edited by Time-Life Books in 1980.  The book is written in a thoroughly pro-Polish stance, which is certainly justified but becomes irritating at times, to say the least. The statement that angered me most in that respect is found on page 93 in Chapter Three about the operations of the Polish military underground: "Though the Polish resistance killed about 150,000 Germans, this did not come remotely close to the 5,384,000 Polish citizens killed by the Germans during the occupation." I frankly don't know what to make of this sentence. First of all, it is not clear whether the figure for Germans killed by the Polish resistance refers only to military or also to civilian casualties. In the former case, it would be wildly exaggerated, cross off a naught and you got the accurate figure including casualties sustained by German forces during the Warsaw Uprising. In the latter case, we are talking about a lot of innocent people who deserve more than only such a perfunctory notice, even if the number of Polish victims was 36 times higher. But as Lukas doesn't even bother to provide a detailed breakdown of the 5,384,000 Polish Jews and Christians who perished under Nazi occupation, why should he dedicate more than one sentence to German civilians killed by the Polish underground? The apologetic tone of the sentence is another irritating factor. When we speak of crimes against innocent people, comparing numbers and setting off one crime against the other is an utterly inappropriate attitude, one that I would expect to find with a pro-Nazi revisionist, but not with someone who is supposed to be a serious scholar.  I must say that I once recommended this book on a Third Reich discussion forum after reading through its first chapter. I would not recommend it again, however, after going through the whole of it. As an old German saying goes, you should not praise the day before the evening.. 
 Stanton L. Jones and Mark A Yarhouse's book Homosexuality: The Use of Scientific Research in the Church's Moral Debate will fail to convince anyone that is not already of the same opinion as the authors. With all good intentions the scientific evidence reviewed is such that supports their own view and lacking in that which is contradictory.   Attacks on Kinsey's research are nothing new, but the continued flaws of those attacks should be pointed out. Treating Kinsey as if he were attempting to look more at prevalence than variance is one way in which the authors attempt to discredit the research. Mentioning that his original background was in entomology rather than human sexuality is another. The problem is that these are not flaws in Kinsey's research, rather they are a scientist focusing on one aspect and presuming that more research will be done on other aspects.  The attack on Kinsey's research for going after a variety of sources becomes more glaring when the sources Yarhouse and Jones approve of have such limitations in number. The authors, themselves, make many of the mistakes for which they criticize others. This book is neither balanced nor fair. It ignores the main thrust of scientific research - for example, I could not find one reference to the Journal of Homosexuality - in favor of side groups that have been discredited - such as members of NARTH.  The book looks good with a multitude of footnotes, but fails to provide such normal resources such as a bibliography, list of sources cited and more. It's an attempt to look profound and achieves banality 
 Kuiper calls himself a reformer but he does a carefully worded job of making the Reformation look like a mistake.  According to him both Romanists and Protestants are linked by the Creeds.  He calls the Latin Vulgate "Jerome's noblest achievement".  Martin Luther attributed much of the errors in the Roman Catholic Church to Jerome and Origen, but Kuiper leaves such "tidbits" of important information out.  If you want to return to Rome and have "historical precedent" from the RC perspective for doing so, this is the book for you 
 This cd was garbage the only song i liked was street lights and that;s just because the chorus was ok. i bought this cd because the source gave it 4 out of 5 mics. it was just garbage. after i bought it i gave it to my brother and he did not like it eithe 
 Is this for real? It sounds like John Tesh or Harry Connick Jr. I just got this CD and it put me to sleep. It should be called Destination down the tube.I'm a diehard Bon Jovi fan from New Jersey and I cannot believe he released this tragedy.I love all the CD's from Bon Jovi but this solo by Jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.And for Richie,Bryan and Tico, please don't let Jon out of your sight again 
 The story started off OK with the first two short chapters.  Then it falls apart.  The template is used but isn't filled out.  The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that.  Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction.  Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid).  There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's.  A very disappointing read 
 There was very little in this book that would be useful for leading anyone to Christ, which is what Godly leadership is all about.  Scripture was used out of context in far too many places.  Never was an emphasis made on encouraging a personal relationship with Christ.  There is no way that a person can SUCCESSFULLY use the concepts that Christ taught without KNOWING Him personally. There was lots of talk about being spiritual, but NONE about knowing the Holy Spirit.  I would highly recommend, instead, James Hunter's "The Servant" 
 I may be in the minority, but I think these books are absolutely horrible. My twin's teacher reads them to the kids at school, and my daughter loves them. She brought one home to read to me, and I was appalled. I think they are tasteless and have no redeeming value to them at all. The grammar is horrible (this is how Junie talks), and although I know it is suppose to be funny,  I just don't get it.  The subject matter is even worse. I think kids are too young to worry about boys, and I do not believe I want my kids reading books that are so mean spirited. With all the wonderful choices in children's literature, why choose this 
 Whis book has been badly influenced by H. Figuroa's Caribbean Psychology percetion of the cyborg image 
 It would have been good if the item was delivered. Too difficult to follow Amazon up, no further purchases to be made 
 I really didn't like this.  The idea for the seer was interesting enough, I suppose, but it wasn't executed well.  And Vesputo... first of all, who the heck names a character Vesputo?  It screams cliche.  Anyways, he was just sort of... semi-evil.  Like he was trying too hard to be manical and ended up looking like a video-game obsessed member of Generation X with the goatee and the shirt that says "I AM THE VILLAN" or some other rot like that.  It just didn't work.  And the whole... 'random assasination of the king' thing wasn't done that well.  I had to read it twice, because I was like "Eh?  What the *heck* just happened here?".  And the romance was something that you'd expect a third grader to write... the handsome prince suddenly shows up after a few hundred pages and it's all "MY LOVE!" and they haven't seen each other for what, a decade or so?  It's kind of ridiculous.  So all in all, it's something like three and a half stars for concept, minus two for execution.  But Amazon doesn't let me do half stars 
 I can't believe this book is still in print.  It reads like a flow of conscientious and is based on faulty research skills.  There are numerous erroneous statements that reveal much about the author but little about the teenagers of Bergenfield.  This book is less about exposing "suburbia's dead end kids" and more about an image of "how things must have been" produced by the ego of the author 
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 This CD is forgettable, except for "Toxic" and "Brave New Girl", but still, a CD with 2 'Ok' songs doesn't make a good CD 
 I had always wanted to read something by Eudora Welty, and this book cured me of that.  What a confusing bunch of characters--one didn't know if they were white or black--young or old.  The one bright spot in the book was her very descriptive language 
 At the end of her TV shows it states  For entertainment only  So is her book for entertainment only???????????  I like Personal Finance for Dummies. Some "Dummies" books are too simple and have to many jokes but Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good.  
 Bernard Hermman's score is magnificent.  This was a major let down for me considering it was directed by Truffaut.  Lacked any real suspense and edge.  Boring camera work for the most part.  Some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster.  The acting was fine...I guess.  It was just a pointless story I felt that really didn't go anywhere.  And what was with that crummy ending 
 Don't believe the claim that you can "just plug it in and it's ready to use." This product is set up for Windows, and the instructions for installing the drive for a Mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the Windows software. It's easy to become hopelessly fouled up.  Don't expect any help from Western Digital. If you can actually get connected to them, and your call isn't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so, you'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive. Their web site help is equally useless 
 After reading the reviews for this book, I couldn't wait for it to arrive so I could read it.  How dissappointing it was!  Although I found small parts of this book to helpful, the majority of it was silly.  The author  talks about NEVER contacting a suicide; what if a family member crossed  from suicide?  He places alot on the ouija board, how he conjured cowboys  who onced lived in his apartment!   There just doesn't seem to be alot of  truth, as well as the fact that alot of it is just plain boring 
 While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and ""SOILER"" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way. 
 I was expecting a lot from this CD: I'd heard a lot of RSJ's music and really liked it so when I went ahead and bought this I just couldn't wait for it to land in my mailbox. Unfortunetely I can't say I was pleased.  The lyrics are great, don't get me wrong but the melodies were just...strange.  On the 2nd track we get some funky techno music, and on the last track a very calm tune, on the 7th track a more ''popish'' one. I guess there just isn't any harmony in it all. Too bad because there are some really good messages in there but they're clouded by attempted post modern music. the 2 stars are for the very pleasant songs ''wait for me'' and ''my hope' 
 Once upon a time, I worshipped this cookbook...then, I moved to San Francisco and became accustomed to the Bay Area cuisine. Mollie Katzen's recipes do not stand up to the refined fresh, wholesome foods that this region of the country has perfected. I am actually quite disappointed in some of my former favorite recipes. They have not withstood the test of time....the flavor combinations are definately off..... 
 I read this book and find it poorly written.  The Author has no real story line, he keeps going off in different directions and never keeping to the story at hand.  He puts too much junk into it.  First rule of any writing - keep it simple and straight to the one and leave the fluff out 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 I was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son, but when I took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper. I have washed it several times but it is still very rough. Also the first time I washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed. It was very cheaply made, but my son does love it, purely because its Thomas I'm sure. I wouldn't buy this again 
 I bought this based on Patricia's review and loved it for the first month, then noticed it making a strange sqeaking noise.  Upon closer inspection I noticed multiple welds breaking (I'm 185 lbs).  Now I'm not so happy with it, no warrenty, Amazon won't take it back.  Good thing I have a friend with a wire welder who can fix it for me 
 Good for the right wing, religious individual or (for those of us who are neither) those looking to expand your horizon. Must have a VERY open mind to read this book if you are not spiritual or are more liberal.  Well written, interesting arguments, just not for me 
 I really did'nt like this book at all. I think that it is a very confusing and lame story. Sorry no hard feelings. I mean there was nothing there to keep me motivated and interested in reading it. You talked alot about Econ throughout the story which I thought was very cool, just for the simple fact this is for my Econ class. Its like your telling life time stories about yourself and others. You sure do have alot of characters throughout the book. Overall I think that the book is okay its just not a book for me 
 I looked at this book when I was just starting out working on IPsec. I had read the RFCs once but felt I needed a good book since the IPsec protocol is pretty complex and the RFCs are not very well written. I did not buy this book but scanned it thoroughly in a bookstore. The book seems to repeat what the IPsec RFCs say without adding more to it. There are very few figures in the book to explain the concepts. I ended up buying "Demystifying the IPsec Puzzle" by Sheila Frankel which is a much better book 
 Ok, let me say one thing first: I have yet to finish the novel.  I don't know that I will.  So can I really write a fair, balanced review? No.  But I couldn't keep reading without saying a few things about the book.  First off, someone should have edited this book.  I've yet to encounter the typos mentioned in other reviews, but the author tends to drone on and on about things I couldn't care less about.  Second, where in the world are these people from?  The actions of the two main characters are so superficial and staged that it made me lose interest almost immediately.  Scott even thinks to himself several times that he doesn't like Ryan, but continues to hang out with him because he's so cute.  Next thing you know, he's playing his flute for him in a completely ridiculous scene that had me groaning out loud.  And the camping trip....I mean, come on.  Let us in on a real story, with believable actions, not where the two characters seem to be merely drifting through a string of set pieces that don't make sense.  Third...ah heck, I'm not even going to get started on the corny dialogue.  Let's just say I hate that I spent money on something and I can't bring myself to get through it.  But sheesh.  I compare this to Common Sons a little, where the characters sometimes behaved and said things that didn't seem real.  The only difference is, with Common Sons, the two main characters were at least interesting enough to care about.  They held that novel together even during its hard to swallow parts.  This one simply falls apart page after page.  
 The problem with Acharya's book is she compares Jesus figure, her main source of knowledge about Jesus is the four Gospels of New testament and the other contents of the NT, to the historical, more accurately mythological, figures. If the author asked any Muslim what you don't accept about Jesus, he/she will answer her that Muslims do not accept concepts like Trinity, Son of God, Jesus is a god, the idea of Jesus death on the cross, the idea of his resurrection, even 25th of December as Jesus birth day (Muslims know clearly that Jesus' birth day  was more likely between July-August not in December!)...  There is no doubt that the Gospels have been affected by the ancient mythologies and many concepts of modern Christianity have been derived from ancient civilizations (Egyptian, Indian, Iranian...etc) however, this does not mean Jesus did not exist or his character had been reconstructed from the ancient history only...Also, this does not mean the Gospels' writers added these concepts; it could be the generations who came after them! Although the gospels had been changed by addition/deletion, but the truth still inside these books and you can easily refute these concepts that had been added to them from ancient civilizations if you read the bible rationally...There is no doubt also that Buddha, Krishna, Mithra, Huros...etc were also good figures, more likely messengers/prophets of God to different nations, in their times and a few decades after their death, people transformed them into gods.  Similarly, the idols that were around Kaaba, in Mecca, were for good people.. A few generations after the death of those people, ancient inhabitants of Mecca, the Arabs, made figures, Taboos/idols, to remind them with those good people...After that, people start to worship them as a link to God as ancient Arabs used to do before Islam.  Similarly with Isis and Otheris and their son Horus...A few generations after their death, they became sacred figures and ancient Egyptians started to worship them and build superstitions about their regular life..The question that the author (and maybe the readers as well) has to think about is what is real about Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Huros instead of trying to prove they all are image of one person. I agree that there are common myths about all of them...but this does not null their existence as normal humans (More likely messengers of God with a common mission and after some time of their death, their life became a myth as aforementioned).  The link between Solar system and these figures is notable since ancient cultures were so interested about astronomy/astrology.  Thus, to mix what people like about the Sun with real Mirtha, Krishna, Buddha, Huros..etc can be explained as an ancient idea propagated to different era and nations and became an inherited myth...In conclusion, there are a lot of myths about Jesus, Buddha, Mithra, Krishna, Huros..etc that nobody can deny and these myths have a common ancient background...but the real identity of those figures can be explained in many different ways.   This book is your best choice if you are interested to know about ancient religions and transformation of good figures into mythological gods.     
 I bought this book hoping to find some new exercises that would help me expand my skills.  But I found most of them too basic for my tastes.  This book might be good for people who are just learning to flex their writing muscle.  But for anyone who has been writing for a few years, don't bother 
 I find it necessary to include the fact that I read this book for class and not from personal interest.  Though I agree with previous comments that the book was well written regarding style and grammar, I found reading this book to be a laborious task.  The author subjects himself to an experience with drugs, vomits, does not wake up for several days, and then continues to subject himself to this...repeatedly.  If anybody wishes to know what it is like to experience various narcotic trips after a white rabbit and is not inclined to read Alice in Wonderland, this is for you.  The book is basically a series of accounts of one man's experiences with wacky weed and magic mushrooms 
    'A Mighty Wind' seems to be 'This is Spinal Tap' done in a folk medium. Unfortunately, the gags and cliches in this film seem to be lifted, as another reviewer stated, from most of Christopher Guest's previous efforts. To put it mildly, halfway through the film I was half-asleep and wishing a dwarf would crush Stonehenge 
 It reminded me of when I got mud in my mouth, while playing diggers in the garden as a child! Sorry but this wasn't for me I'm affaid.  The water just turned black and it tasted 'earthy' 
 I read a book called The Whipping Boy. It  was not very good.  This story is about a prince who has a few problems. He is always gets in to trouble. Since the prince can never get hit, they have a whipping boy to get hit for him. The whipping boy gets hit about three to four times a day. The whipping boy's name is Jemmy. The prince's name is Brat. Jemmy and Prince Brat run away and get into a lot of trouble.  It was vary confusing and hard to keep up with. My mind was drifting around. I would give this book a 1 out of 5 because it was not very good. It was kind of stupid.  The only way you would be able to like this book is if you like stupid books. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It seems like a good book from the cover. The first few chapters are good. But then it gets really boring. After every chapter it got really confusing 
 I ordered this book because of all of the wonderful reviews.  What a true disappointment!  The projects are very basic and the designs are not exciting.  And, some of the photos feature some poor workmanship!  Any experienced beader will find this book to be  a waste.  I returned my copy 
 After giving this album repeated listenings, I'll echo the complaints many have made: there simply aren't enough memorable melodies here and I'd say the lyrics are a bit dodgy as well most of the time. ("You are not my typewriter/But you could be my demon..") The band masks these deficiencies with electronic squawks, blipping synth, toy pianos and cascading white noise that make for a gorgeous soundscape while you're listening. The problem is when the little aluminum disc stops spinning: the songs don't keep replaying in my head as they're supposed to. Sometimes the band has a good melody going but belabors it into dust. (See 7 minute + epic "Reservations")  HIGHLIGHTS: The band's moment with the littlest pretense is easily the best. "Heavy Metal Drummer" wistfully recalls starting out in music. ("I miss the innocence I've known/playing KISS covers/beautiful and stoned") It's probably also blessed with the catchiest melody here and the electronics ladled onto it COMPLEMENT the song rather than compete with it. Outside of that one, lowkey "Jesus, Etc." is a country-tinged charmer that again features one of the better melodies here. Superfluous instrumentation and effects are missing here but they're not MISSED: The song doesn't need them. "I'm the Man that Loves You" employs a bit of jaggedness musically in the form of a willfully cacophonous, feedbacked guitar but it's there to spice up the song. Without it, Wilco would still have a solid effort.   LOWS: It's hard to single out the valleys here, not because the songs are pretty decent but because the flaw with most of them is the same: I just can't recall the melody as soon as the song ends. I'd probably say the worst offender here is "War on War". "Poor Places" is another that never really seems to grab onto me at all.   BOTTOM LINE: In the end, I see this as Wilco's counterpart to R.E.M.'s REVEAL: an album with weak tunes gussied up with fussy and avant-garde sonics to make them sound larger than life. It DOES grow on you a bit with repeat plays but not so much that I think it'll ever become a favourite Wilco release and certainly not one of my "Desert Island" albums. Enough Wilco fans are deriding this that I'd say that it's not even safe to say "Diehard fans only". Best to hear this one before plunking down your duckets...  2 1/2 star 
 THIS KANSAS COLLECTION DIDN'T DO SO GOOD...THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS CARRY ON WAYWARD SON. THAT IS THE ONLY SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD ON THE RADIO 
 Certainly not AC/DC - this is a quick cash-in record. On this soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive, we get three crappy new songs (Title track, instrumentals D.T. and Chase the Ace), as well as a selection of songs that can be found elsewhere: the even-worse Sink the Pink and Shake Your Foundations (Both off of Fly on the Wall) as well as a few older, much-better AC/DC tunes (Ride On, You Shook Me All Night Long, Hells Bells, For Those About to Rock) that are best heard on their original albums (yes, this is worse than For Those About to Rock). And I know that this is supposed to be a pseudo-compilation. In that case, more from the Bon Scott era would be necessary. Avoid. 
 Do not buy.  This may be the worst product I've ever bought.  It has never worked properly.  I've kept fresh batteries in it, but it's still no good.  Within 10 feet of the laptop, I'll click three or four times and nothing happens.  Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end.  It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen.  Awful product.  Believe the bad reviews.  It's worse than they describe.  The only positive thing I can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy.  My cat loves the laser pointer 
 This movie is being promoted in its trailer and on its website as having something to do with the BDSM and consensual Master/slave relationships practiced by some in this community. In fact it is a piece of total BS that is about kidnapping women, selling them, killing them and selling their body parts. The plot makes no sense. All the details about such relationships are wrong. The presentation of "training" and its results are laughable. If you want to watch a couple of naked women running around and being treated like dogs for part of the movie, then it may be worthwhile, but unlike the opinion of some others here, this movie has nothing to do with anything that happens in the real world. And the acting, editing, etc. are not even B movie quality 
 Having read the book many times growing up & seen the CBS series, I was a bit disappointed with the movies. While great for loyal Christy fans who're familiar with the characters & the incredible story, I agree with some other reviewers that 'newbie' fans shouldn't start with the movies. The original CBS series was great!!!  Although Lauren Lee Smith, Diane Ladd & Sam W. are commendable, I think Kellie Martin's Christy, Tyne Daly's Miss Alice & Randall Batinkoff's David were MUCH MORE believable.  At times, the acting came off a bit overly done or not enough & unfortunately, Lauren's Christy struck me as a bit...bland.  The saving grace: 3 cheers though for Stewart Finlay-McClennan's returning performance as Dr. MacNeil!  Hope this helps: I'd try to get the whole series 1st, and then these movies 
 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother isn't Mycroft but the `forgotten' third brother Sigerson (actually the assumed name Holmes used in The Adventure of the Empty House), and there's a lot to forget about this failed attempt to do for the Holmes family what Gene Wilder did for the Frohnkensteens. Without a collaborator on the screenplay and taking the directorial reins himself, as well as the starring role, there's far more unfettered self-indulgence here than wit. There's thankfully a little less pointless hysteria from Wilder than usual, although this is sadly more than compensated for by excessive yelping from Leo McKern and tedious showboating from Dom De Luise (now there's a surprise). Indeed, this may well be the only film in which chronic overactor Aubrey Morris gives the most restrained performance. There's also an excess of messy eating and childish humor to contend with, not to mention the unforgivable waste of Marty Feldman's unique talents in a dull sidekick role. There is one funny sequence in a ballroom and a couple of moments where the ideas are good enough to survive the sledgehammer execution, but when Albert Finney, in a one-shot cameo in the film's Night at the Operatic finale, turns to the camera to ask "Is this rotten or is it all terribly brave?", it's not difficult to come up with an answer.  As with The World's Greatest Lover, Fox's DVD offers a decent 1.85:1 widescreen transfer as well as a fullscreen version, with optional original mono or remastered stereo mixes. Aside from the theatrical trailer and trailers for three other Wilder films (Young Frankenstein, The World's Greatest Lover and Silver Streak) the only extra is an audio commentary by Wilder that is so sparing and uninformative that you'll wonder if you clicked the wrong button on your menu!  
 Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself 
 Regardless of whether or not the video is annoying, the real problem is that the main character, Baby Bear, has a speech impediment and does not pronounce all of the letters correctly.  For a video that is supposed to be teaching the alphabet and rudimentary phonics, this is a major problem.  We watched it once and then promptly put it in the garbage.  Sesame Street should be ashamed of itself 
 What these 2 artists bring to the table are heaping helpings of warmth, humanity, charm, even sweetness -- not to mention wit and originality.  Their trademark parodies of everyday situations, when they work, are nothing short of uproarious.  "Mother and Son" and "Merry Christmas, Doctor" are priceless, timeless routines that play so well 40 years later as to show the brilliant vision underlying this artistic duo's act and ability to push the envelope in their time.  The question in buying this CD is whether the strength of those cuts, plus the generous quantity of cuts, can compensate for the faded vitality of the others imposed by the passing of time 
 This mounting kit will be perfect for you... as long as you have a stud exactly in the right place.  Unlike most kits that include a cross bar to affix to studs on either side of the desired mount location, this kit has two holes in the plate.  You can thus mount it directly to a stud, and nowhere else.  So if you're trying to center it in a precise spot, you better get lucky with the stud finder.  (Or have a masonry wall 
 I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about high performance driving without the cost of going to a school, but roughly half of this book is just advertisement of Bob's driving school in Southern California. For example, on controlling skids, he talks very little about how to get out of a skid and then he begins on how you can learn more if you come to his driving school because the school has such and such equipments. There's even an entire chapter dedicated to how to graduate from his driving school. He also seems to be obssessed with his past glory, which he doesn't mind spending time to talk about. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 Coltman gives his work credibility by freely admitting two important truths: Castro enjoys the warm support of a majority of the Cuban people, and Guevara and Castro were not at daggers drawn, but remained comrades-in-arms to the very end of Guevara's life. But with every political event and turning-point in the revolution that he describes, Coltman systematically distorts or omits the impact of popular mobilization by the Cuban people. He leaves out the milllions who marched in favour of socialism during the Mariel boat lifts in 1980. He says nothing of the hundreds of thousands who poured into voluntary work brigades during the fight against bureaucracy and stagnation in the late 1980s -- under the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party. He insists on seeing the revolution as the work of one talented megalomaniac, leaving out the facts in order to bolster this view. In 1960, for example, the Cuban delegation to the UN in New York was greeted by enthusiastic crowds in Harlem when Malcolm X arranged for the Cubans to stay at Harlem's Hotel Theresa. The delegation had been subject to politically-motivated and racist harrassment in their Manhattan hotel. Coltman portrays the incident as a shameful foray into the realm of prostitutes and shabby digs. Completely missing the point. As does his whole book 
 This book utterly disappointing and uninsightful.  One would expect more from a "scholar" who sat in on the trial.  Unfortunately, as is too often the case, Fletcher fails to measure up 
 My suspicions were confirmed that Sandra Brown has written romance novels in the past.  That was my assumption when I read this book.  The characters were shallow, the surprise ending was predicted, and nothing about this book was believable.  It was fast-paced, and I finished it, but it is one of the least favorite books I've read in a while.  We selected this book at my book club, and nobody seemed to enjoy it very much.  Overall, it was just ridiculous 
 A poor documentary. An attempt to make porn acceptable and very unsexy at that. A repulsive movie.   Watch instead the recent made for TV series entitled Rome.  The series Rome is accurate and entertaining and without a doubt the best of its type ever made 
 I see nothing in these allegedly shocking documents that shocks me.  Why wouldn't anyone who wanted to save the lives of Jews not cooperate with the devil himself - or even Hitler (who was worse because he actually existed!) - to save them?  And why wouldn't Hitler want all the Jews he could get out of the country to go and resettle in a small strip of land in the Mideast, all the better to eventually wipe them out?  Indeed, Hitler was *definitely* collaborating with the Palestnian Arabs with whom he shared the goal of doing just that.  Lip-service to tryants who can wipe you out is a not a surprising thing, especially when there is a war going on with the outcome uncertain.  One says and does what is necessary to survive, which may be "unprincipled" but is also understable 
 In 1977 I was eight and far too young to appreciate this slice of ubitquitous AOR southern Californian pop-rock. Now, at 38, I should be old enough. Yet this still leaves me cold. It's only a matter of taste, and clearly millions disagree with me, but this music doesn't make me FEEL anything except tedium. There is one exception: Go Your Own Way is undeniably a decent song. And that great bass riff on The Chain DOES still sound great and brings back happy memories of watching Grand Prixs on tv when I was a kid (it was the theme music in the UK).  Otherwise though, to me, this is a bunch of coked-out, self-satisfied musicians coasting on automatic, who fully understand that safe, bland songs like these have the potential to bring in pots of cash. There's nothing remotely ambitious about these songs: they're custom-made for undemanding ears who want some light background entertainment while driving to work or washing the dishes. There's nothing wrong with that in itself - there's a demand for undemanding music and we all want a bit of background diversion from time to time. And that's about all that can be said for it, really.   Fleetwood Mac got the last laugh. They could have churned out these songs in their sleep, yet they made them multi-millionaires. Good for them. Being successful has rarely had much to  do with creating interesting music.  
 I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before.  They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus.  It would not even play in my CD player.  When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the "WAV" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files.  Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again 
 I always judge music, not by the first few auditions, but whether or not I listen to it in the future.  As in the case with Tosca's latest release, Dehli9, a year after I bought it, it is gathering dust.  This does not detract from the quality production value and the sheer talents of D&H (Dorfmeister and Huber).  However, I am still listening to Tosca's masterpiece, Suzuki, on a regular basis for the past 5 years.  I expected Dehli9 to be another graceful yet complex work but after the first few listens, I was bored with the music.  Most tracks are nothing more than lounged-out versions of deep house music.  Me and Yoko Ono is particularly irritating (and don't get me started on the repetitive vocals).  This piece would be better served as an instrumental.  Wonderful, one of the strongest tracks, still has a jazzy, commercial feel to it, almost like it belongs in a shampoo commercial.  This CD is not the blunted, abstract music we have come to love from Tosca.  I thought the 2nd CD would be bonus, unreleased tracks or a "Dehli9 remixed" EP.  Alas, I was again disappointed by discovering this was a collection of Rupert Huber's experiments on the piano.  Honestly, the music was quasi-nighmarish...better suited on a Silent Hill or Resident Evil game soundtrack.  I have only played CD2 once, never to grace my player again.  In all fairness, this would be a good work to educate the uninitiated to the world of lounge, downtempo and trip-hop.  However, you would be better served by skipping this uninspired work and head to the good stuff, like Suzuki and Opera.  Hey, even the Honey EP gets better marks!  Maybe there will be a "Dehli9 in Dub" in the future?  It can't be any worse than the original...or can it? 
 As an initiated priest of Palo, I can say that it depends on what house you are in whether you think this book, or any other book by Lydia Cabrera, is all that good or not. This one does have some interesting material, as do all her books. But it has plenty that is not universally agreed upon, and it has absolutely nothing at all to say about the deeper, and most important secrets of Palo. Palo is not a standardized tradition. What you know and what you do depends on what house you are coming from. The houses are secret societies. You can't expect to learn anything without being in a house. It's as simple as that. No good Palero is going to make the secrets public. By their very nature, that would be insane. Not that I am showing disrespect to Lydia Cabrera. Her books are more or less good. I like some parts of her "La Regla Kimbisa." But a word of caution to you who want to dabble with African magic: there is a lot that will never be put into writing. Dabbling, when you don't know what you are dealing with, and especially in Palo, is a very fool hardy and dangerous thing to do. You don't know what you don't know. A lot of the older Paleros question what got into Lydia Cabrera to write what she did. Palo is closed to the uninitiated 
 Sounds just like the last record if you ask me.  Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with.  God bless him 
 I have always thought this band was terrible. I'm sorry they had to go through the horrible tragedy of having their singer murdered, but the music itself is heinous. You can rarely understand the lyrics, and the music makes me wanna plunge letter openers into my eardrums. It sounds like a screaming, sloppy drunk 
 The best part of my DVD is the FBI warning at the beginning and the theme song.  I am 4 episodes into to the first dvd and I have not laughed even once.  The humor is not clever.  It is Chris Elliot falling down and hurting himself over and over again, or exposing himself to radiation, and then someone cranks up the laugh track. I liked Chris okay on David Letterman; he wasn't the main attraction, but his skits there were okay, and I appreciated them.  Unfortunately, so far in this first season, this series sucks.  It isn't funny; it isn't clever.  The idea behind the series, a loser who still lives with his parents and has a paper route has promise.  The execution is pathetic.    Let me give you an example of one of the most clever things on the show.  Chris falls in love with a gal in the 4th episode and he confides in Gus that everywhere he looks, he sees this girl's face.  Gus points out that he has pictures of her put up all over his room.  And the camera shows lots of pictures of this girl all over his wall.  Big laughs from the "audience."  Now, if that sounds funny to you and put a smile on your face, you will love this series.  Later on, this gal throws a rock from her window and hits Chris in the head.  Again, the laugh track is cranked up.  For me, I don't know if I will watch past this 4th episode.   There are many good reviews here, which are an absolute mystery to me.  Maybe the key is, if "Married With Children" is your idea of high comedy, then "Get a Life" maybe right down your alley.   Notice on several reviews, people recall how great this series was when they were 11 or 13; but when they see it again, they are suprised as to how bad it is now.  Maybe this would appeal to your 12 year old kid; and maybe if your intellect level is that of a 12 year old, this could be the show for you.  "Friends," which is not my idea of a great show by the way, is probably too subtle for you. 
 This documentary reveals the shocking fact that companies, by law, have an obligation to their stockholders, rather than to society at large.  But this isn't the only case where 'people' by law are required to focus on only certain responsibilities.  What about doctors?  When a doctor treats you, by law that doctor is supposed to think only about what is best for you.  Shouldn't she really also be thinking about whether others would be better off if you were out of the way?  Shouldn't she give you an injection that would peacefully put you to sleep if she feels that society as a whole would be better off without you?    And what about accountants and lawyers?  Every time an accountant handles someone's money, he should be legally obligated to consider whether it would benefit society to take half of the person's life savings and give it to charity.  It's wildly inappropriate for your accountant to be legally obligated to handle your money in your interests.  What about the greater good?  And your lawyer should never act mainly for you - each and every lawyer should be expected to consider everyone equally, rather than giving special emphasis to her own client.  Let's get serious - in order for a corporation to act in the interests of its stockholders, who are the last in line in case of bankruptcy, it must first meet all obligations to others, or else there will be nothing left for those stockholders waiting at the end of the line.  As an ongoing business, companies have reason to care about their reputations, about earning loyalty from their employees, etc.  Yes, some companies have done bad things, just as some people have done bad things.  Can every single person be condemned as a psychopath, simply because there are some examples of humans that were considered psychopaths?    Corporations, like people, can do harmful, dangerous things.  There's no doubt that many of the problems documented here actually occurred.  But it is the reponsibility of government to regulate corporations, just as it regulates people.    The example of Bolivia, where people were forbidden from collecting rainwater, is an example of the failure of government.  Why would the government give such rights to anyone, even itself?  But when government regulation has been adequate, privatization of water and many other services has been hugely beneficial to the poor in most countries.  Demonizing corporations for faithfully managing the money invested in them is ridiculous.  Corporations, and individuals, should be regulated by governments.  If outrages are not detected and punished, then government has failed.  But we shouldn't abolish government, or corporations, or people, simply because none are perfect.  We should 1) hold governments accountable for performing their role; 2) hold corporations accountable for legal violations (through fines, and through sending corporate executives to jail in extreme cases, as has happened many, many times); and 3) use public pressure and our own personal buying decisions to give corporations an incentive to make socially responsible decisions.  If you really care about the poor around the world, then put the blame and the pressure where it belongs - on bad government 
 This filter was a nightmare to set up, and it is probably my fault.  See, I got ths filter for the 2 aquatic turtles that I have.  Anyone who has turtles knows that one does not want to have the entire tank filled as though they were keeing fish. Turtles need to be able to get out.  I started looking at canister filters ecause of a blog entry on the fluval canister filter. I researched and researched looking for more informatio on alternate filters, after all the xP2 was less expensive an for most posts, it was a toss on who had the better product. so I got it.  4 hours later dealing with priming I finally have a system that isnt working quite right but at least its doing something. Modifications were done using the excess hosing on the intake to conince the pump motor that there is more pressure.  So I guess there is a moral to this story, this is not the filter you are looking for if you have any need to have the tank less than all the way full. and if you make it work like I did (heck spending 130 on the set up-- it does not come with addional media like ceramics like the fluval does-- you better believe i made it work!) it is not silent. you hear all sorts of air popping noises, but this is the quietet i've gotten it so i'm quitting whle im ahead.  happy tank keeping 
 Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking. 
 I'd never read Berry before, but as far as I can tell, this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory. However, it's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm. There are two related problems with the book: one of presentation, and one of tone. The problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there's no room for specifics. So, while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of Berry's vision, there's no detail to back it all up. The problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at. Of course, some of the pieces are lectures, but there's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book. It comes out when Berry uses certain words such as the three As of "appropriate", "authentic" and "adequate". When these are used ( as they often are), there he's obviously made some kind of value judgment, but the reader is never let in on it. The end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir.  Which is unfortunate, since I tend to agree with Berry on a lot of things (though not his anti-abortion stance). Small farms are good, agribusiness is bad, stewardship of the land is good, extraction industries are bad, treating the body as an organic whole is good, and things of that nature. Alas, he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful. Two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate: "This is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed." and "Communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people, country life, and country places."   Berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses. For example, in one essay, he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine, untouched state, and that's all. While there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way, they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with Berry's views on stewardship and land use. It certainly doesn't help matters that his view of small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose-colored glasses. His claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition. However, it ignores the fact that, historically, small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins, was subject to all kind of external instability (weather, vermin, etc.), and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level. In farming, cash is scarce, that's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself, such as in WWII, when all those defense-industry factories were opened in California. (Of course, in Berry's vision, you don't really need cash, because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors.)   Berry's exhortations to create small-scale communities is worthy stuff, and even in cities people are creating this. The growth of CSAs, farmers markets, and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this. However, to achieve the large scale results Berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection 
 o.k., i just finished listening to the C.D. of Predator, which i had downloaded on my I-pod.   Well, i kept thinking the book was abridged, or maybe i had made a mistake in the download.  It jumped around so much that i was convinced it was abridged, but it wasn't!  i have so many questions, i can't even list them all, and think maybe we should all form an on-line group to see if any of us can answer them.  1. was Johnny the doctor killed or was it suicide?  and who killed him, and most importanly, WHY?    2. why were the members of the family killed and how were they known by the serial killer? 3. when did Kay and Benton make up, and why the heck is she always so angry? this is just the beginning 
 I took this book to Vietnam as my best resource for travel.  According to the book, I would find a country full of good food, friendly people and have a good time.  Shortly after deplaning my fellow nursing faculty was arrested.  It went downhill from there and I was frightened to my core.  We were monitored, detained and taught our volunteer courses under the worst discomfort I have ever known abroad.  The food was terrible, rats the size of dogs in the university, and were clearly unwelcome Americans.  I have not travelled since, and would caution the reader that this guide is very unrealistic.  I would never had gone if I had read a more objective account of what to expect in Vietnam. I will never buy Lonely Planet again 
 I also didn't like it. I don't see what the hype is about it personally. I thought Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy was great but this one doesn't tell you anything that common sense wouldn't! I say if you want to try it out, use the library. That way you aren't wasting your money on it 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book "The Great Divorce" 
 I have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly.  There are a lot of good books out there, Dan Harrington's the very best, but this isnt one of them.  Too much ego here and not enough helpful information 
 This small book (120 pages)has 40 pages of content and 80 blank pages to record your personal history.  The author's personal history and lab results are included and offer little in substantive advice on managing the illness 
 Anthropologically speaking, Raphael Patai - born Ervin Gyorgy Patai (in Budapest, Hungary, in 1910; son of well known Zionist Joszef Patai) - is not a Westerner as the book might lead us to believe. Why would a Hungarian-Jewish ethnographer compare Arabs to Westerners instead of his own tribe is a puzzle that no one could resolve - pretty much like when Bernard Lewis, and a bunch of other Orientalists, compare Islam to the Western Civilization instead of their own. To be sure, Ervin Gyorgy Patai does well sticking paragraphs one to the other and twisting them to his liking; he would have done so poorly had he tried some empirical work: cutting-edge statistical analysis with solid theorizing. Let us not forget that anthropology is not a science - it was created primarily for the purpose Ervin Gyorgy uses it: to profile people he despises in the way he wishes. To cut the story short: a Westerner would have never written a silly book of this type; after all, the Westerner is a rational living, one with a beautiful mind, and so empirically fascinating... 
 Read both books and all the reviews of 2 books with basically the same name and if you want more information in a MUCH MORE user friendly, readable (in English) format at 1/2 the price buy the other book by Smith, Divorce and Money Everything you need to know.  I read a review that the Smith book just wants you to hire expensive lawyers.  NOTHING could be further from the truth. No matter what, you need a lawyer and this book tells you the same thing.   It doesn't mean you have to be stupid!   As a normal, middle class guy with a college education and MY OWN BUSINESS this book makes you feel like you are in Latin Class again.  Do your self a favor and not only buy Smith's book on Money get her book on Children.......you will save lots of time and stress 
 Where did they get the reviews on the cover of this book? The resemble nothing I found in reading this.    One of the first rules of writing is "show- don't tell" Danielle Steel took the low road in writing this simple tale. The plot is extremely weak and the way it is told... is well "told".  The feelings and inner thoughts of the characters are told to us, not shown. The character are told to the reader to be lonely, sad, etc. Instead of being in positions that relect that state and therefore allow the reader to conclude that. It is very amateurishly written. I am afraid she was simply trying to pump out another book, and rest on her laurels from the past. tsk tsk tsk..... lazy 
 I've  made >20 visits to France all together.  Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the Metro.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.  
 FROM AMAZON.CA ---------  The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer (VGE)....or at least it claims to be. My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region-free DVD player and a memory card compression utility (squeeze more saves onto your memory card). I have not used either of these features personally, but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards; some reusable, some permanently damaged. This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it. However, the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I'll get to those in a second.  The ARMax, like the newer Gamesharks, loads its software from a CD. This is a major annoyance for me. Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card (which does I don't know what) and CD, go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load, choose your codes, then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load. You can't simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down. In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down. The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it. If you wanted it to load before the game, you turned on its switch. Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way (and it's not, btw), it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first. I mean, why can't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don't have to load the software EVERY D@MN TIME.  Ok, rant over. On to the codes. The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark. Functionally, they are very similar of course, but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use. It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions (not for user-entered ones though, if I remember right), and a more robust Expert Mode. On big advantage, in theory, that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2's broadband connection. The upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller. The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download; its all or nothing. And since these updates are stored on your memory card (not the ARMax one), it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99% of which you will NEVER play! No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card. It's to store all the useless codes! Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work, do nothing, or lock up the game. I have come across all, though to ARMax's credit, mostly the former. The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library, when you may want just one, loses the ARMax another star. A note about manually entering codes: The sub-headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game's code list.  Finally, as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols (Amazon.ca), the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL. This happened for me as well. I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions (at the time) of ARMax. I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected. Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine, I assume any bought today would not have this problem. However, at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally. Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site. This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars.  In my opinion, if you're in the market for a VGE, both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons. I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have. Looks at the specs, assume nothing, and don't be afraid to e-mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about.  I apologize for the length of this review, but I find there are very few in-depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print. Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs, I don't know. 
 This film stinks. It gives B scifi a bad name -- even makes those Roger Corman movies look stunning. If possible, I would give it a negative rating to balance the positive reviews seen here. If you want cornball underwater action, buy "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea." Provided that your cerebral cortex is active, you'll agree it's a zillion times better 
 I like Ringo's work in the "March To..." series and I liked Williamson's "Freehold", so when I saw they had combined in a new book, I put that on my to-buy list.  I waited until the paperback came out, bought it, and happily sat down to read it.  Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to my own mental hype.  This book is apparently a continuation of a series involving something known as the Posleen War.  Not having read any books involving that before, I went into this book cold, and I am coming out the same way.  There is only a cursory description of the variously cultural entities that are at odds with one another, and no real emotional reason given as to why one is supposed to be better than the other.  The bad guys seem to to be something called the Blobs, but since that gave me the mental image of a moving scoop of green Jello, I found it hard to work up an interest in them, or to care about them one way or the other.  The basic plot is a group of commandos land on a planet to recon a suspected enemy base, which they do without incident or much dramatic tension.  On the way back, they find an alien artifact from an extinct, highly-advanced civilization, that would be worth "billions".  This artifact is basically a Hitchcockian "maguffin" - something everyone is pursuing but that really doesn't have any significance to the story.  We never really learn in detail what exactly the thing is, what is does, how it works, etc., and in the end it is immaterial.  Greed arises, compatriots are killed, and three are left to try to rendezvous with the escape craft, one of whom has the artifact.  Pick any WWII movie and you can place the three remaining stereotyped characters:  the psychopathic sniper, the determined outsider, and the loyal "kid".  The story centers mainly around Dagger (the sniper) and Tirdal (the alien Darhel) and their mental battle with each other as Dagger pursues Tirdal a la "The Most Dangerous Game", with the character Ferret pursuing them both, trying to figure out what's going on and who to side with.  Ferret was actually the most sympathetic character out of the three.  Dagger was just a textbook psycho and bully, while Tirdal, who is the hero, is never really emotionally accessible.  I knew that I was supposed to care about him but I could only manage a lukewarm interest.  Basically this book consists of a geographical tour of whatever planet it is they are on and their hostile encounters with the local fauna, which are giant bugs.  Everyone takes potshots at each other, with various wounds accumulating.  The one you expect to die first does, the bad guy fails, the hero wins.  Tah-dah.  The book left me dissatisfied.  It would have worked much better as either a short story or a novella.  The novel format was just too long because the action, once the group was narrowed down to just the three characters, was simply repetitive.  Except for a few quirks, there was really very little development of Tirdal in the context of why being a Darhel among humans was so culturally odd.  I wanted better explanations of the players and the situations.  I kept wondering what the point of the whole story was, and I never quite got an answer to that one.  
 This book was the bane of my existence throughout 9th Grade Geometry. Having had a year of a  real  math book this year I am finally able to realize just how stupid the book was. It treats the student like he or she is about two years old, does not provide the information necessary for exam review, and is far too colloquial in general. In addition, it has no answers in the back, just "Hints" in the back of the book that either do nothing at all to help or solve the problem completely without explanation. It also says "SHAME ON YOU" if one looks at the hints without first trying the problem. Personally, I don't enjoy being chastized by a math book, especially one with such a bad approach to Geometry 
 This book covers ALL cats in general, it's not specific enough for Persians. Dissappointing 
 I am a huge fan of the old MGM musicals and have been more that happy with the restoration quality on every DVD transfer issued by Warners in the MGM library. The release of the "Dream Factory" collection is a fine example. These films could have been photographed yesterday ("Summer Stock" is a pure delight to watch in terms of picture quality). "Barkleys of B'way" unfortnately does not live of to the exceptional quality acheived on other films of this genre.   The DVD picture quality is very poor and dull and the sound is very muted. I was so dissappointed in this treatment. The DVD appears to have simply transfered the Video to DVD. No restoration to the picture is at all apparent. Even the trailer looks better than the movie.  The extras are fine and I can't complain here but hey Warners, what were you thinking when you tackled this gem. Someone must have been taking a sickie!  Sorry Fred and Ginger. 
 THIS BOOK READS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY A MATH LAWYER!!!  The text is confusing and way too redundant.  The sample problems are well-explained,  but they're a setup for the homework problems to make you feel stupid.   I bought this overpriced book, the solutions manual, and the study guide...I feel screwed.  If you are taking a class that requires this book.....DROP IT!! 
 I do not recommend this book unless you are more interested in a technical history rather than a layman's history.  It may make a good textbook, but it is not exciting to read 
 This book is absolutely not worth reading--it's barely readable, has no defined plot, and is an overall disappointment. There is no plot in this book beyond sex scenes and clumsily drawn out character "relationships" which tend to consist of the protagonist realizing that she has to have sex with someone.  I don't recommend this book at all 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 This book disappoints.  I mean really, really disappoints.  NOTHING happens for half the book, and then, she slips in a little bit of plot and a neat conclusion.  Really, why read a whole book for a half-books worth of story?  This book has two acts.  Act I: What Fitz does when he isn't doing anything interesting.  Act II: A short plot, which is extended to fill half the book.  Basically, if you LOVE Fitz, you will LOVE the book.  Of course, I don't LOVE Fitz or even the Fool (since his personality and demeanor change all the time).    While Robin can come up with interesting magical details about the worlds she writes about, her characters are unrealistic.  They behave like real people, but they don't behave like "assassins" or "royalty" should.  They behave like regular people.  Surely, assassins would not share a similar mindset to say, your little brother.  But yet, in Robin Hobb's world, her characters are designed to create that empathetic response in their behavior, and her plots spin and twist to avoid their character having to do something that most people would hate to do, say like kill some innocent guy in his sleep like an assassin would.  In her world, royalty has no advisors, and no other assassins.  And they take advice from assassins, and chum around with assassins, finding them nice people.  Because, they are nice guys!  Her books are popular, because she creates likeable characters and put them into interesting situations that people can relate to.  And then she adds a few fantasy elements, and kabam!  You got a story.  Not a really coherent plausible story, but people stop paying attention to the details because they LOVE the characters!  That is the ONLY way she could have gotten away with a book that talks about a lonely guy and his dog (sorry wolf) raising chickens in the middle of nowhere for hundreds of pages!  Oh, and it is TOTALLY logical to adopt a son?  A single parent with no job adopting a son?  Try something else, please 
 If you know how pull-down menus, tabs, and buttons work, and you can figure out all on your own that clicking on the tabs marked "Face", "Hair", "Material", etc. will lead you to the places where you can edit the character's face, hair, and materials/textures, you are far smarter that the person this author had in mind when he wrote this book.      Maybe I can explain best using an example. For each "room" - hair, face, material - he uses a similar structure. In the Material Room chapter, he spends pages 122 to 126 describing what you see when you open the Materials room interface. This is one of MANY lessons on "using the interface", which takes up all of chapter one (45 pages on how the interface works) but is ALSO repeated throughout the book.   In this case, what you see - what he will describe - is the Shader window, which has some pretty obvious stuff: a help button, two pull-down menus labelled Object and Material, and two tabs labelled Simple and Advanced. Then there's some less obvious stuff: a texture map, a variety of controls with names like "diffuse color", "ambient", "reflection" across the top and "add subsurface scattering", "set ambient occlusion", "IBL", etc. down one side.  The author completely ignores all that stuff about ambient occlusion and diffuse color. He spends page after page explaining what the "object list" (a pull-down by which you can select which object is being edited), "material list", etc., and how the "simple" tab and the "advanced" tab offer the user a selection between simplified controls vs. more advanced ones.   Then, when you do finally graduate to a real tutorial, it turns out to be pretty simple stuff. Lesson Two in my above example (the materials room chapter) is how to load and save textures. There are two sidebars on pages 129-130 that summarize the entire process of loading (p. 129) and saving (130). Really they aren't all that advanced: loading involves opening a library and double-clicking, while saving involves pressing the save button. However, he still has to spend an entire lesson on this, because he's got to talk about all the things you'll find along the way -  for instance, he mentions in the text (but not the sidebar) that when you press the Save To Library button, you'll get a dialog box allowing you to name your new texture. (Because we all know how overwhelming it is to be confronted with a box demanding that you name something.)  In this - and all - lessons, it's at a VERY basic level. 
 Bash has very many operators/symbols, e.g. [[ ]]  Finding discussions of the symbols is impossible, as the reference doesn't have many of them.  As a direct result, it is a miserable experience using this book to try to learn BASH or to try to interpret existing scripts 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 This book really is badly edited. There are entire pages that lack punctuation. It's difficult enough to master torts without struggling through the basic grammar. The book also is very case heavy and explanation light. Those reading it had better hope for an excellent torts prof 
 This man is nothing but a terrorist.  His organization leads "protests" in which all involved sport black masks and destroy private property while spreading vile lies.  He should be in prison 
 This printer is GARBAGE. I have used printers since 1989 and this is definitely the worst. I owned a few Epsons with no problems at all, I only upgraded as the technology improved, not because any of them were broken or didn't work.. and I think next time I will go back to an Epson. The hp is a "photo" printer, but if you put more than 3 pieces of photo paper in it at a time, it will jam and waste your paper and ink. It also will not do envelopes without hand feeding it one at a time, hand printing would almost be faster! I have had this printer for over 2 years and the only reason I am writing a review now is because I just tried to put regular paper in it and print a single page word document and it jammed yet again and it was just the last straw. Don't waste your money. This printer is way too expensive, and in my opinion, total junk! My husband bought it because of the memory card capability, but as far as I can tell that is the only redeeming quality of this printer at all. I will take great pleasure in smashing this one to bits whenever I get around to buying another Epson! 
 I was sooooo disappointed.  I had high expectations for this book and found that it was really nothing more then stories told from a counselors chair.  This book told me nothing about how to overcome the problems, but instead focused on experiments conducted to account for jealous partners.  Truly a waste...there are other books out there that are much more useful 
 A friend gave me this book suggesting that I would enjoy it, and I  dutifully read it. I wish I'd spent my time differently. There are some  good jokes in it, but all in all, it's not very enlightening 
 This light worked for me when I used two D-batteries, but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions. I was also unaware that the light was fender mount, and wasn't happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light. I found that replacing the front  reflector with the light worked OK for me, and this replacement was easy on the cruiser I have. My main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet, and the missing installation instructions 
 Anyone reading this book must be careful not to accept at face value the conclusions Chancellor reaches about this extreme, fundamentalist, high-demand group. The methodology he used in writing this book is flawed, and so the picture he paints of this dubious new religious movement/cult is very distorted. The Family practices a doctrine referred to as "deceivers yet true," which they use to deceive outsiders as to their true nature and intentions, including scholars like Chancellor. Even the editors of this website have accepted Chancellor's claims in the book that The Family has changed for the better.   I strongly urge any reader of this book to do their own investigation of The Family on the internet, and not just blindly accept what Chancellor says about it. They will be shocked to learn the true nature of The Family, and it is not as Chancellor makes it appear 
 This book slams families with more than one child.As an only child myself I took this book out of the library out of curiosity.Mrs neuman is obviously against the traditional family and glorifies the idea of having one child.As an only child I have to say that the research is seriously FLAWED.The parents of onlies will not live forever,friends and other relatives will never be as close as a sibling.I can honestly say that I would give anything to have a sibling and I deeply resent my parents selfish decision to have one child.Not all onlies are confident or social butterflys as she boldly claims,very often the opposite is true.Very often the so-called MYTHS about onlies are in fact true.This is a sad attempt to sell a book .The greatest gift that any parent can give their child is a sibling.I have 5 children,they are well provided for,we dont live in poverty or chaos,we dont need to spend thousands on classes galore,we certainly dont drive a station wagon,or live on macaroni and I stay home with my kids.Mrs Neumans negative view of large families and stay at home moms is sad to say the least 
 this was a nice ideal but it didn't do anything it said it would d 
 Greetings Everyone!     Ijust bought the new Turilli's Album. I can't understand why does Luca make so much albums in very short period of time... Ok, the guy is great, he has an amazing sense of melody and a vast imagination but Luca! Have a break!!! This Album sounds Tired, Uninspired... How can i tell you... It's boring! We wll know how great commposer you're, give us great albums like the first Rhapsody's or the amazing two albums from you as solist... I can wait for a very Turilli Album, there's no need to rush! Sincerily Juan Pabl 
 ... but if you loved the movie What the Bleep Do We Know, then you will be doubtless swept away by the warm and fuzzy feeling of this trite plot and rather cursory and one-dimensional examination of Western philosophy, which completely dismisses or ignores Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Husserl, Schopenhauer, Habermas, Foucault, Heidegger, and others (and totally misses the mark in its analysis of Sartre's humanism). 
 As brevity is the soul of wit, let me be brief.  First of all, I found reading this book to be an arduous task.  I feel the same way that Joseph Conrad did, namely, I saw no emotion in it. Let me take just one sentence out to illustrate: "...in order to distinguish in...Gilberte an indefinable quality analogous in the world of the emotions to what in the world of colours is called infra-red, my parents would have needed that supplementary sense with which love had temporarily endowed me."  I imagine that if I were to write this sentence, my writing instructor's red ink comments would be "Wordy, awkward, over intellectual".  Compare Proust's sentence with how John Steinbeck expressed the same sentiment: "Once, when I raptured in a violet glow given off by the Queen of the World, my father asked me why, and I thought he was crazy not to see. Of course I know now she was a mouse-haired, freckle-nosed, scabby-kneed little girl with a voice like a bat and the loving kindness of a gila monster, but then she lighted up the landscape and me".   This pretty much sums up my reaction to this book.  I cannot recommend it to anyone, no matter how famous the book is and no matter if it won the Prix Goncourt, and no matter how intelligent Proust was, and no matter how many people say they wouldn't have wanted to go to their grave without having read it.  All I can say is, Read it, and see for yourself why you shouldn't read it (paraphrasing Samuel Goldwyn).  
 David Moody has written a hyper-realistic apocalyptic zombie survival thriller - not simply a knock off text of popular zombie movies, but a strongly character driven book.  Three Characters who are so obtuse and dull, and written in the same first person voice as to be indistinguishable from either each other or the 3rd party intermittent narrator.  Virtually nothing happens in this book - sure most of humanity is wiped out, and eventually rises in mass - but readers know how that goes; getting a hyper realistic look into the psyche of three nearly identical characters isn't that interesting - and certainly doesn't warrant 200 pages.   Maybe as an American reader I expect more from both my zombie thriller and its protagonists, than several trips to the grocery store, lots of soup being consumed, and one brief chapter of massed zombies at the barricades 
 I have to admit, I love Martial Arts movies. Not rip off wannabe beat 'em ups like Blade or Three Ninjas. No, actual Kung Fu in your face in Cantonese movies. Being a fan of Iron Monkey, Crouching Tiger, and even Vampire Effect I was expecting great things from this movie. After all, Zhang Ziyi kicks ass in ANY movie she is in. (Literally and metaphorically)   As the title suggests, Zu Warriors takes place in the clouds of the Zu Mountains. The Omei are the most powerful gang of warriors around. But we also have two seperate heroes from the gang: Red, with metal wings which can slice and dice anything in his way, and King Sky who now controls the legendary Moon Orb after his master Dawn dies from the attack.   Attack of who? Believe it or not HIS (He sounds more like Ru Paul than a gritty evil warlord) name is Insomnia and he uses all of his souls to stop the Zu Warriors and get the one thing every villian in a movie craves: 1) the downfall of good 2) and the rise of evil. Personally, this Shang Tsung rip off couldn't do much damage if he didn't have those faker than Joan River's face skeletons floating about him.   Not to ruin the story, but as all viewers know, good always triumphs - but not before surmounting obstacles. Enigma, who holds the Heaven Sword, is actually the reincarnation of Dawn, who was killed by Insomnia earlier in the movie. Thunder, who, you guessed it, holds the Thunder Sword panics during the union of the Heaven and Thunder swords and calls upon a warrior named Ying to carry out the job. Red gets possessed by some little fairy (her name is not really important, they only say it once during the movie) and so begins one epic quest of King Sky versus Red. How cliche. Two friends for centuries battle the final epic duel. You can guess who wins that one.   This movie has it's moments with it's awe inspiring visuals, but it's not enough to carry the movie. Zhang Ziyi basically only has ONE fight scene in this whole damn movie and that is against Ying. Trailers boasted that the heavens would call apon a human being (Zhang Ziyi) to help them fight against the ultimate evil. Granted, her sword does glow beautifully, but if blinding your opponent is her greatest weapon that crap is for the birds. Even with the U.S. dubbed extended version, this movie cannot be saved long enough for viewers to want to keep watching. 
 It is authors and books like these that continue to show that there is no evolution in the novels put out but white wolf...they only want action, no character development or originality, is really very sad. You want a good fanatsy book...read someone like Sharon Shinn, Glen Cook or Mercedes Lackey and steer clear of  poorly written amateur books such as this one 
 Buy this book for Shag's art, not the drinks. These drinks are mostly modern sweet syrupy messes designed to please the moronic masses. Where is the appealing balance of sour and sweet? Not here! If you are serious about good tropical drinks, I suggest you seek out the Grog Log or Intoxica 
 Although this item is advertized as "waterproof", it is not!  It stopped working the moment my dog went into the water.  Otherwise worked fine.  The DOGTRA shock collar works better and is waterproof 
 I purchased this book as I have read two other books by Elsa Beskow to my daughter.   The concept of seasons is one that takes time for young children to become aware of - my two-year old daughter is just experiencing her second winter, and Beskow's previous books slowly bring that awareness about.  This book, again, does a good job describing the concept of seasons and children engaging with it. It does, however, describe other not so innocent concepts - killing and descrimination.   The father of the children decides for whatever reason, to go and exterminate bad snakes in the forest, also labeled monsters and enemies, as the children look on.  Having seen their 'heroic' father kill the snake and realizing that they are too small to kill such a large animal, they practice by trying to kill ants in the forest - after all ants are smaller than they are!  Maybe I'm being a bit sensitive, but I found myself changing the story at these points, rather than have my daughter be confronted with the idea that these 'good people' go about killing animals that they percieve to be bad or evil.   As a father, I have the sensational pleasure of watching my daughter become aware of the glorious natural world we live in, especially so during our walks in the forest. I would rather have her continue to see me as someone who respects and admires, than someone who has negative preconceptions about the creatures with which we share our planet  I will be returning this book 
 I first read Clavell's Shogun when I was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in East-Asian culture. In many ways he helped bring me to Japan, where I have lived for a total of eight years. However after reading his works for many years, I was quite bored with Gaijin, which I never finished. I perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little. His messages in his other works were repetitive in this one. Amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an Asian perspective. I grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their Asian counter-parts, and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how East meets West. Some of my friends in Japan have read Gaijin and liked it; but after owing so much to this writer, I am sorry that I could not say more of this work. 
 Rumi is one of my favorite poets but Barks does not do him justice.  The translation poorly written so it feels choppy.  Furthermore, he changes it so it water down the power of Rumi's poetry.  Do not choose this book 
 In this book, the author tries to encourage Americans to forget the Declaration of Independence because even though a plurality of men have rights, the rights of individuals have never been identified.  So, the author becomes a member of Marilyn Ferguson's Aquarian Conspiracy and the New Age movement, which place individuals above `the people' of the USA and its Union.  On p. 277, the author says that the truth or falsities of the natural rights philosophy of the Declaration of Independence is a meaningless question.  While the author's conclusions can be challenged, his book has been out-dated by advanced knowledge.  First, his writing is out-dated by the 1920 discovery that' all empirical data are symbolic.' Thus, one must ask, 'How can the meaning of the Declaration of Independence become a meaningless when the Declaration is formed out of symbols that must be given meaning in order to interpret it correctly?  Second, modern science has recently led to the scientific proof of God's existence.  How can man have no natural rights if God exists?  If the author's succeeding generations are accepting this book, the USA is in deep trouble. 
 The book is suppose to be a guide to identifying trees by viewing the leaf systems, branches, and bark....it is in black and white, so color, variations, etc are not seen.  Therefore, as a identification book, it is worthless.  Also, it is a little large for hikers and canoers. 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
 These do work great for organizing CDs and DVDs, and I do still use them, but I found that the two inside CDs/DVDs can become scratched by a small plastic ridge that runs down the middle of the page. I kept my TV DVDs in these pages for awhile, and discovered that all the discs on the inside of the pages had been scratched along this ridge. A few of my Simpsons discs still won't play certain episodes. So I keep all the discs on the outside slots only, and I've never had another problem with them. I use the inside slots for liner notes/episode lists, though I usually have to trim them to make them fit right 
 This is Guido Sarduci from the Royal Tuscan Office of Copyrights and Internets and I must insist that you cease any and all sales of theese so called "Tuscan Whole Milks" immediately or I will have to come there and beat you up and then my mom came upstairs and saw me fighting and she got scared and said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air!" I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could said that this cab was rare, but I though "Nah, forget it. Yo home, to Bel Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I said to the cabbie "Yo home, smell ya later!" Looked at my kindom, I was finally there, I could sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.   Love me sum Tuscan 
 From the cover, this movie looked like a fun mixture of Cruel Intentions and Metropolitan. No such luck. I think the biggest problem in this movie was the script-- the writing was so bad that it was actually painful to listen to the dialogue. Though there are some normally fine actors in this cast, it would have been impossible to triumph over the poor script, and the cast as a whole seemed strangely void of emotion, except for a few moments of melodrama. I found myself hating even the characters we were supposed to sympathize with. Delilah, who is supposed to be the "fun, crazy" outsider, simply disgusted me with her actions at the movie's central party. Even the art direction in this movie was strange-- many pivotal scenes in the movie were shot from very far away. The strangeness of this movie is not intentional, it's just lack of skill. Stay away 
 This is a recording of the very disappointing recent London production.  The singing is smooth but lacks depth and, as can be heard in the dialogue sections, the interpretations are not very convincing.  The only exception is the marvelous Philip Quast, as Emile.  Mary Martin remains the greatest Nellie with her wonderful warm "mix" of head voice and "belt" 
 I had high hopes for these space bags.  I bought several in advance of our cross-country move.  I think two of them worked, as in, stayed sealed and compressed.  The rest would not stay sealed, no matter what we did.  I would not buy these again.  I wish I had saved the money 
 Having taken ballet classes for eight years, I was not at all impressed by this DVD.  The production quality is poor, there is very little barre work and the instruction is brief.  Much of the DVD is in fact movements which aren't related to ballet.  I attempted to follow this DVD one time and gave up - the instructor is awful.  Save your money and don't buy this 
 If you've got a subscribtion to any teenage magazine out there, have friends or watch TV, you've probably know all "tips" this book offered. All of it is very common knowledge. Drink 8 glasses of water a day? Check. Set concealor with powder? Check. Line lips with lipliner to make lipstick last longer? Check. However, its good for those who aren't feeling great about their look. It's got that "You're GREAT the way you are!" vibe. For the rest of us teens who want to know actual makeup advice such as how to do smokey eyes or even contouring, look elsewhere. If you're curious, check this out of the library like I did 
 The 2002 version of the Star Wars core rulebook is an improvement over the original.  It upgrades some underpowered character classes, adds some breadth, and makes much-needed improvements to the very abstract and annoying vehicle operation system used in the 1999 rulebook.  Unfortunately, the central, crippling problem with the 1999 version remains:  the d20 system just isn't well-suited to Star Wars storytelling.  Playing this game is nothing like playing out a Star Wars story, and a lot like playing Dungeons and Dragons in space.  Star Wars is fast-moving, fluid, and dynamic, and not much concerned with power balance.  A kid fresh off the moisture farm can fight his way past elite enemy troops to save the princess, and one Sith Lord can arrange the downfall of the entire Jedi order.  Audacity and heroic (or villainous) attitudes matter more than experience and number-crunching.  Major characters rarely die, and then only if there's a strong dramatic reason for it.  Plotlines are loose and free-form.  A game based on Star Wars should reflect that.  By contrast, d20 is very cut-and-dried, and very regulated, and much too lethal.  Concepts like "level", "class", and "hit points" are fundamental to the d20 system, but are not very applicable to the Star Wars universe.  The system has a lot going for it, and it's great for Dungeons and Dragons, but here it's a case of trying to stuff a square peg into a round hole.  I prefer the West End Games "d6" version released in the late 1980s.  It has its flaws - it doesn't deal with very powerful characters as well as it might, and character creation could use some tuning (particularly for Force-sensitive PCs) - but it captures the feel of Star Wars.  A revision of that rule system, or a completely new system incorporating the best features of both d6 and d20, would have been a much better choice than using the d20 system as a "one-size-fits-all" set of mechanics.  However, it seems unlikely that Wizards of the Coast will forsake their flagship d20 system for something as high-profile as Star Wars.  So I suggest that if you really want to get into gaming in the Star Wars universe, look for a used copy of the West End Games version 
 I had such high hopes for this one!  However, after about a dozen tries, I cannot stand this music.  It is uninteresting and possibly contains the worst songwriting and lyrics I have heard in years.  Or maybe it's the schmultzy music that is so unbelievably weak.  Whatever it is, it has no magic, no risk, no intelligence.    
 I really love Cat Stevens' early work such as Tea for the Tillerman and Catch Bull at Four.  When I found a Mona Bone Jackson LP in a yard sale I thought I was in for a real treat.  However when I listened to it for the first time I thought it was so bad that I immediately threw it into the garbage 
 I can't believe they would ruin perfectly good toilet paper on this. What's the world coming to 
 I gave up reading this tripe after about 60 pages or so. Mr. Hughes may have actually had something valuable to say in this book, but it gets lost amongst all of the socialist ("liberal democratic" and so on) propaganda. The book appears to boil down to "If the government would just give everyone everything, it'd be all right. 
 Many of my issues with this book were covered in another review. Most of the "plans" are really just a couple tracks. The diagrams aren't clear enough for a book on track planning (for a magazine writeup, maybe, for a book of plans for practical use, no). The plans are repetitive and derivative of each other. And, as previously noted, there is very little breadth of offering - over and over you see the same format of layout: for instance if you have any significant-size space but don't want a multi-deck layout, you're out of luck.  It's not 101 layouts, it's 101 variations on 2-4 basic ideas.. 
 I don't know what film some people have been seeing, but this movie is TERRIBLE!  Poorly scripted, transparent plot, bad acting and ridiculous set design reduced this movie to barely tolerable.  If you look at it as a parody of women-in-prison porn, you'll enjoy it.  A little 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 The problem isn't with the unit taking a long time to chill a bottle of wine, the problem is that it doesn't chill a bottle of wine.  I put a bottle of room temperature Chablis in, and selected Chablis from the list of white wines. The unit said it would chill it to 46 degrees, and indicated that the starting temp was 77. That was my first concern, because the bottle was room temperature, and room temp was 70. The unit took more than 30 minutes to get the bottle to the desired temp (according to the units thermostats), but when I opened the bottle, the wine was probably a bit warmer than a pinot should be served at. I turned the unit off, placed the bottle back in (using the accompanying sleeve both time, btw), and this time the starting temp read 61 degrees. In other words, it disagreed with itself...  Soo...I chilled it again, for another 20 minutes, and upon reaching 46 (again) the bottle was no cooler than it was before.  I don't understand how these are selling. They are probably good for bringing room temp reds down to the appropriate serving level, but this simply does not chill white, rose, or sparkling wines to the desired temperature. So it's great, I suppose, for someone who doesn't have a wine refrigerator, or a cellar, but who wants to drink red wines at the appropriate temperature. It's terrible for anything other than that.  This is as disappointed as I've ever been with a product before 
 in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"     more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!! 
 A MOUSE LOOSES HIS FAMILY MEMBERS & THEN FINDS THEM.  IT'S JUST AN OK BOOK, VERY UNDERSERVING OF ALL THE 5-STAR REVIEWS.  A BETTER MOUSE BOOK WOULD BE- IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE. 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 At first I was enthralled but as the book went on it seemed more like one of those toddler books where each page shows some aspect of a child's day- My Breakfast- My Friends- My Bath. I really don't care to know what she has in her closet. How trite!! I agree with several of the other reviews. There is nothing new and seems to be more of an ego trip of a woman with too much time on her hands 
                   At a time when many historions and authors are bringing out important re-evaluations of the causes of World War I, there are still large numbers of the same that continue to bolster the accepted,"Official Versions of Who Caused the Great War".                   Aside from some of the defects mentioned by other reviewers this author presents the German military as operating in a vacuum. That, in fact, the military alliance between England and France, with France also having a military alliance with Russia, all of which was aimed at Germany specifically, had no consequences or dangers to either Germany or Austro-Hungary. That the then massive bank loans of France to Russia had no military application when, according to French documentation, the loans were tendered with the understanding that they would be used to insure the ability of Russias military  to mobilize rapidly against Germany.              Furthermore, the political and cultural attitudes in all of the European countries had no bearing on the military thinking of all of the militaries involved.                There are many other better histories available.                 
 I was looking forward to reading this book with my women's Bible study group.  I read the first chapter and decided I hated it.  Stormie is a martyr, has a negative outlook and lets her husband walk all over her. This is a book only for women who hate their husbands and want to live life as a martyr.   I was looking for a book that would help me pray for my husband who is a wonderful person.  He treats me with respect and listens to me.  Stormie makes it seem like you can't pray for a man who doesn't abuse you and make you cry everyday.    I've been with a man like that and if I'd married him (Thank God I didn't) Stormie would suggest I let him hit me, call me foul names, etc. while looking for where I was to blame.  However, while I've grown spiritually and become more prayerful in my life since then I am not fundamentally different.  I have the same flaws I've always had and my husband has never called me names or touched me with anything other than loving hands.  Also as far as his sexuality goes, I've been on antidepressants that severely affected my sex drive.  I've since changed medications, but through my three months of struggle my husband constantly sought ways to help ME because we kept the lines of communication open.  I felt guilty enough about my lack of feeling and Stormie would have made me seem selfish when my body felt dead.  I am not saying that there aren't things we can change about ourselves that would make our lives and marriages better.  Prayer is a wonderful way to seek God's guidance in how to handle a situation.  But we must be willing to listen to God when he calls for action as well as for inaction. We need to be willing to handle the situation.   If you are screaming at your husband, then "shut up and pray!" but after you've calmed down it is time to address your issues head on.  Communication is essential in marriage along with prayer.  My husband works long hours and is often travelling for business but he is ALWAYS home when he says he will be give or take 15 minutes.  There is no excuse for the disrespect of abandoning your family without notice. There is no excuse for harsh, angry words.  There is no excuse for violence.  And I ask and pray that women do not pray to accept those aspects of their husbands.  AND NEVER LET HIM HURT YOU!  Pray for his heart to soften.  Pray for his healing, but do that from a safe distance 
 Some good essays, but most were undergraduate pieces from the 1950s,except the ideas were less compelling than they would have been in that era. Disappointing, but also revealing, because as always it would be better if poets just wrote poetry (unless your John Keats: see his letters) and stopped cluttering up the world with their prose 
 Can you hear me now? Yes glen, we can hear you. I feel so bad saying this but this cd was mixed like crap. As I listened to the first track in my car I audibly said to myself, "what the crap is this?" Glen's voice was so loud and obnoxious. Not that his voice was obnoxious but the fact that I could hear nothing other than his voice. I listened to 3/4 of the song and could not take it anymore, so I skipped to the next song with the hope that the producer was going for a certain sound for that track, and that the rest would be fine. I was wrong. Virtually every song on this albums was mixed the same way. I was trying as hard as I could to listen to the music underneath but to no avail. I can tell that the music would be beautiful if it were audible. I love Nickel Creek. They are one of my favorite groups. I also love Toad, but for heavens sake, what is this? I am glad to see that I am not the only one that has noticed this 
 Did not expect much for 10 bucks... but give me a break, 2 weeks and the plastic streched and tore around the handle up on top of the smoker.  I think a heavy duty trash bag is what this product is equivalent to 
 I am so appalled that I contributed even one penny to this blatently anti-semitic, history denying xenophobe.  I only wish I could rate this a zero.  This book incites hatred and paranoia against everything Jewish.  He buys into every nazi and neo-nazi theory denying the ethnic and historic origins of the Jewish people. He refers to the holocaust as the "so-called holocaust."  Jews are simply Khazars from Russia who are removing native Palestinians from their land.  (Yes, I was already aware of this theory that has been amply and roundly refuted). He  makes the patently absurd claim that Christianity is the only religion that represents the Old Testament creed of Yahweh. (And makes no effort to prove it--He only goes into  talmudic "examinations" which are totally one sided.  Of course I doubt the authenticity of many of his talmudic quotes at all, but I am aware that the talmud contains everything "and its opposite." He doesn't bother quoting the opposite sentiments. I only wish someone had warned me about the content of this book before I bought it. I only hope that people will realize this author does not represent what true Christians believe. This guy is scary.  
 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 I found this book to be less than informative, and very vague when it came to waterfalls. With regard to a pond it was very good, but fell very short  of how to design, install, and maitain a waterfall. In fact the waterfall  information was on about 4 pages total. Not worth the purchase 
 This is a soap opera that either wants to be literature, or was marketed as literature. It's a romance novel. Many people over a period of many years fall in love, get married, have affairs, grow up, grow old, and have children of their own. Though the characters are scientists, their crushes and affairs are no different from any others' (the book jacket says it's about "inner lives of smart people"). Regrets are a large part of their lives, though only one or two characters are well-drawn enough to be interesting and induce sympathy, and they have a terrible habit of not taking action when they can and want to. Large editing problems render this clearly a first novel, though I give it two stars for the apparent effort put into it 
 What you get for your money: a pastel-colored book with a soft plush cover, some watercolor sketches with text on top of them, and a photo of Mr. Dyer's smiling face on the back.  It makes for nice decoration, but it doesn't make for serious reading. The 10 secrets are little poetic statements that you've heard before in "Life's Little Instruction Book", among other places.  From Mr. Dyer's talks, its clear he knows a lot about inner peace. Too bad he's more interested in packaging it and selling it for profit than teaching it. (There's also a bit of a feeling like he's trying to indoctrinate you into something... 
 Entire book is a work of fiction, with many passages lifted from other authors' work.  What made this book good, was knowing that Nasdijj experienced these events.  Now, it is just a very poor work of fiction.  After doing some research, "Nasdijj" turned out to be nothing more than a failed gay erotica writer with a jealous tint and a short temper.  The previous life as a gay erotica writer shines through periodically in this book and adds a bitter tangent to a mundane piece.  Get a life man; your own, preferably 
 It's interesting for five minutes...and that's when you are flipping through the pages.  He is always coming back to the same points. This should have been a summarized and compressed phamplet 
 This mystery has merits, but the author would have done better to have set most of it at midday, when the shadows and the book would have been shorter.   As I read I had the sense that for its merit (modest) and its purpose (to turn my mind off at a busy time of life,) I was spending far too much time getting to the end.  I skipped from about page two hundred to about page four hundred (!!!) with no ill effects.  I must have missed something, but it all seemed fairly complete. Verbum sapientis. 
 If your IQ is under 25, or you want to be a crackhead, this movie is for you 
 The book is confusing. What is the reader supposed to believe? Clemens was a genius, or, Clemens was an imbecile? "Mark Twain an Illustrated Biography" starts with a preface that says: Sam Clemens was a "genius." Next comes the prologue, which states "his own overreaching drove him and his family into exile oversaes."---That statement could not be farther from the truth. A book that starts by rejoicing in Twain's genius and, then proceeds completely to ignore Twain's genius and portray an imbecile is confusing.To understand the confusion and, put the narrative on page 177 in context, review this sentence: "When she died, she was only twenty-four years old." What is the purpose of the word "only" in that sentence? Putting "only" in the sentence confuses facts and, by that confusion makes a biased sentence. Susy was twenty-four years old: An age by anybody's standards where she is old enough to be responsible for her own health. By combining that sentence with "only" and the pictures of a young Susy on pages 87, 94, 99, 103, 105, 119, 132, 146, 150, the book alleges that Susy was very young when she died, which is not true.It was the family publishing business alone that went bankrupt, not Clemens, a fact previously canvassed on page 157 but by page 177 forgotten; The financial recession of 1893, which was responsible for making the tour necessary and separating the family, was not Clemens fault and he would have to be an absolute fool rather than a genius to think otherwise, a fact previously canvassed on pages 155 & 156 but by page 177 forgotten; Clemens knew that he was in no way whatsoever responsible for the death of Susy; When Susy died, she was not the first child that Sam and Livy had buried; What Sam includes in his letter on page 177 are emotions experienced after losing their first child a son, not emotions consistent with losing their second child Susy. Canvassed initially, the book describes how Sam becomes inured to death by experiencing so many deaths in his life. Then on page 177 it is as if death is a brand-new idea, which Sam, has no familiarity with at all? It cannot be both ways, either he was inured or he was not.Sam's writing was so powerful that he easily conveyed feelings that he did not feel; Sam's writing conveys feelings that he does not feel to relieve Livy's feelings of responsibility and grief: Clemens is magnanimously taking responsibility for things that he knows he is not responsible for to soothe his ailing wife (Sam wrote a similar letter after the death of his brother Henry, see page 20, only an idiot would believe himself responsible for too much steam when he was not even on the boat with Henry.); Livy had been diagnosed with heart problems, which forced the family move to Europe in 1891, a fact previously canvassed on page 145 where it incorrectly states "They [doctors] recommended rest and treatment for Livy in Europe," the facts being rather that Livy was "ordered" to Europe by her doctors, but by page 177 the facts after being distorted are forgotten and without thorough study or instruction, the facts are presented with a vagueness that makes' them impossible to understand.Unequivocally, Clemens in 1906 stated for his autobiography, [Edited by Charles Neider, page 428], Livy was "ordered" to Europe by her doctors. If Clemens knew, Livy was ordered to Europe in 1906, it's only fair to assume he knew Livy was "ordered" to Europe when he wrote that magnanimous letter on page 177 taking responsibility for things that he knew he was not responsible for in 1896. And just as fairly, without any assumption, we may know that Clemens knew he did not cause the financial recession of 1893. Sam's stay in Europe, which he loathed and called exile, was never exile at all, but concession to his love for his wife, Livy, and the requirements mandated by her heart trouble.In all honesty, Clemens was being magnanimous when he wrote "Reproaching myself for laying the foundation of all our troubles. . . . Reproaching myself for a million things whereby I have brought misfortune and sorrow to this family."---found on page 177. Clemens was being far from honest, unless he was responsible for the financial recession of 1893, responsible for Livy's heart problems that forced the families move to Europe in 1891, and responsible for Susy's health when Susy was of an age to be responsible for her own health and had been living on her own separated by half-a-world from Sam and Livy for most of a year.For an entertaining book that does not confuse these important issues I recommend: MEET MARK TWAIN, published by Xlibris

 In this book the well known Dr. Ferber tells us that he is a "specialist" in sleep. He doesn't mention that he is a speciallist in CHILD sleep behaviors at Harvard and NOT an infant sleep behaviors. He doesn't mention that he NEVER works with infants at Harvard and that Brazelton is Harvards infant sleep specialist. (yes there are big differences between an infants ability to sleep and an 8 year olds)  In this book Dr. Ferber tells you to let your child "cry it out" with an occasional check on your child to make sure hes ok and let him know you are still around...even though scientific studies have proven infants don't gain a sense of permanance (ie: they think when you leave the room you are gone forever) until around 7 months of age. Bower and Wishart:1972,   Johnson, M. H., & Siegler, R. S.:1997,  harvard study. Brazelton & Als: 1980 and many more have proven this and Brazeltons countinuing INFANT research at Harvard continues to support this.  And FERBER himself NOW suggests the you do NOT ever use the Ferber method unless your child is at least 6 months old... however that is not what it states in his ORIGINAL book as it was written in the 80's (30 years ago) and unless someone is getting this very new, revised edition they will not know this (As well most parents will totoally disregard this anyways) However in this new, updated version (the new version only) he does go a little bit into building a good night time ritual and rocking and singing to your child as well as Before you "Ferberize," you should make sure that feeding habits, pain, stress (like a child who is screaming and crying isn't going to be stressed) or medications are not causing or contributing to your baby's sleep problems.   In this book Ferber as well suggests in this updated book that, not only should you let your child cry it out but that you shouldn't pick them up. And EVEN if your child is hyper-ventilting from being so upset (wouldn't you love your child to pass out because then he'd be quiet), or is throwing up (which can cause dehydration not to mention its painful) not to pick up your child, but just to clean him off "as best as you can" and lay him back down and leave.  It's a parents job to ensure that all your baby's needs are met. What could be more in need then a infant who can do nothing for himeself, cannot even speak, who is screaming out for help and is trowing up all over. I mean what kind of mother would listen to a man when she feels guilt in her heart and sees her child gettign sick. I feel guilty when I lie, I feel guilty when I break a promise, I know when I feel guilty I am doing something WRONG.  And ensuring a childs needs are meat means not just physically but emotionally as well, Ferber never goes into any aspects of the childs emotional health in this book because he knows it is just another form of ignoring another human begin. Does The advice in this book work..yes it will work for almost anyone, I could beat my kid silly to get him to clean his room..it would work but certainly would be a cruel choice.   Do you know toddlers and infants have no sense of time. Its not just when you say "5 minutes honey" and they say "are we there yet" one minute latter, infants have even less sense of any sort of time, and 5 minutes of crying when they are scared, lonely, or confused can seem like an eternity.  When I am sad I like a hug from a friend, when I need help I would hate my husband if he just ignored me when I asked for help. Why should we treat our children different. Because its to much work?   If you just can't put the effort into taking care of your child day AND night like most people then this book is for you, but be sure to get the revised edition, not the 30 year old version 
 I purchased this book 4-5 years ago, being really interested in the author's theory of "tracks". Dietmar Kramer has taken the Bach flower remedies and classified them into what he calls "tracks", e.g. centuary-holy-pine, where the centaury-associated inability to say no, if not treated, leads as compensation into a Holy state and then into a pine state as decompensation. Treatment follows the track, start with Pine and proceed with Holy and then Centaury.   The problem is that the classification of the remedies into tracks is arbitrary. Problems such as the ones that the Bach remedies seek to treat are not linear. A Pine state for instance does not necessarily have to result from something else and if it does, that something does not have to be holy or centaury. It could very well be related and/or caused by a dozen other states. This applies to all Bach flower "tracks".  Great care must be taken when proposing such theories 
 This hasn't improved much from previous editions and is still as bad as they come. Ever hear of the composer Grofe (Grand Canyon Suite, Mississippi Suite, etc.)? Well, you won't find him reviewed here. How about Gloria Coates? Surely they must cover Peter Maxwell Davies (the renown English composer)? Nope! William Bolcom, Kamra Ince, Henri Lazarof, Bo Linde, George McKay, Mieczyslaw Vainberg, Morton Feldman? None of these either. And the section on Charles Ives, Ernest Bloch and many others is pathetically small. The Rimsky-Korsakov orchestral masterpiece, Scheherazade gets several less-than-optimal recommendations (compared with over 40 in the Third Ear). The examples of this books failings go on and on.   I could go on but I'm getting tired of typing and I've embarrassed them enough so I'll stop. In summary, this book addresses the ho-hum standard stuff that most everyone knows already. Check Schnabel out for good mono recordings of the Beethoven sonatas, Gieseking did a great job on Debussy works in the 50's but the sound is not good by today's standards, etc, etc..   Not a good shopping guide--way too many gaps and you'll miss the good stuff if you use it. Worse, it's misleading. Oh, and did I mention the chubby, hard-to-use design of the book itself? The book has a lot of pages because of the small page dimensions; the Third Ear, by comparison,  has 25% larger pages with almost as many pages (same sized print).   The Gramophone Guide won't stay open and looks fat but really is skinny on recommendations and educational value.   Finally, to tie-in my title for this review.  The Gramophone Guide and the Penguin Guide sometimes say, almost word-for-word, the exact same thing.  I will cite just one example here but I've run into others.  Read the review of DG's remastered release of Wilhelm Kempff's 50's cycle of the Beethoven Piano Sonatas in both the Penguin and Gramophone Guides.  I quote, "Those who have cherished Kempff's later, stereo style for it's magical spontaneity will find this conveyed more intensively in his mono set, recorded between 1951 and 1956."  With the exception of one word and the addition of an adjective, the same sentence appears in both books.   So, there's no doubt that these people read each other's books and copy choice sentences and perhaps don't even listen actually to all of the music that they're reviewing.   So, who's copying from whom?  Maybe it goes both ways or maybe just one way, it's impossible to tell.  But with all of the other faults that this book has I wouldn't pay the postage to have it shipped to me if it were free.  It may be worthwhile checking the Gramophone out of a library for occasional reference or to read an essay, but if you want a book worthy of purchase, get the Third Ear.  It's not perfect, but much better written, honest and it covers almost every composer that you've ever heard of.      
 I can't comment on the "facts" as presented in this book, but I found the writing to be pedantic and tangled. And this from a Pulitzer Prize winner.  I much prefer Kirkpatrick's biography, The Revenge of Thomas Eakins 
 I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.  
 This story line is probably one you've already read by another author, and it's very easy to tell how the book will end.  The details of the book are original, and it does move along and hold your interest, but it's a repeat of a relationship between two people.  I was actually surprised that Ms. Steel would go down this road, and not offer something more original.  
 With all the great revues on this frother, I thought I couldn't go wrong buying one.  Not so though!!  After following instructions in detail, the frother I received keeps getting stuck in the 'on' position and also seems to have 2 speeds.  Also, just to prove a point more to myself, I frequently have to take the top/cap off and press the button to get it to go fast (I don't actually use it to froth this way) ... or use 2 hands to hold it and press the button which is very awkward and then even that doesn't help sometimes.  The bottom line is that it will very seldom operate at it's normal speed or it gets stuck on!!  Clearly this frother isn't working the way it should and is somehow getting stuck or the button doesn't go down enough.  I was going to keep it anyway, but decided to return it as I seem to have no control over wheather it wants to go fast or slow.  I really like that it has it's own stand, so I'm very dissappointed that I can't get it to work properly.  This is a real shame as I was prepared to love this little frothing machine 
 I love blueberries, both fresh and dried, but these have sugar added which makes them far too sweet for my taste.  Dried fruit is always naturally sweet, added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy, instead of a naturally healthy snack.  Thumbs down for this one 
 I already knew that the book was little more than a brochure for Maya, but I bought it because it claimed to have the Personal Learning Edition on CD, rather having to go through the long download time to get it.  Waste of time, since the CD does nothing more than set up the download, then try to connect to the Alias/Wavefront website to obtain the data.  I have a different book, the Maya Bible, that gives me all the learning resources I'll need for awhile, but I still can't start since the disk doesn't have what it says it has.  Don't bother with this book 
 I've read all of Hamilton's McKnight novels and this one is the worst.  It took me well over 300 pages to get into this novel and by that point I'd spent so much time reading the book I just wanted to be finished and done with.  I've thoroughly enjoyed all of his other novels but this one just seemed to have no purpose, couldn't grab my attention, and was just a painful read.  If I wasn't such a fan of his earlier books I would have put this book down after the first 40 pages.  I still own this book but wouldn't put anyone through the torture of reading it.  If you have yet to read the McKnight series read his first novel, A Cold Day in Paradise, it's a classic mystery.  
 A woman I would think would not be interested in totally wasting her kid's time recommended this line of DVDs to me, so I got one - fortunately only one.  It was TERRIBLE!  I don't understand what is going on with all the hype and other fantastic reviews.  The DVDs are mindless, way over-acted, Barney-esque entertainment with very little education.  I really like Little Einsteins, Kipper and Dora - but if you are more of a Barney fan, maybe you'd prefer the Wiggles.  Fortunately, my 2 year old did not get hooked before I discarded the DVD. Yes, discarded - I would not pass this on to anyone else!  
 The reader who said this book is challenging hit the nail right on the head. It is indeed very challenging to read this book and realize that it is written under non-fiction. Like Michael Moore's "documentary" which was more fiction than fact, American Dynasty should be listed under fiction not non-fiction. Of course the left wing liberals will like this book as much as they like all of the  other mindless, factless, feelgood garbage that permeated book store shelves up untill 13 months ago and were proven to be baseless nonsense. Some people want to believe which is to say, they probably want to believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and The Tooth Fairy too.  You can skip this one 
 After reading this book I actually omitted all caffeine from my diet for about a year.  In all honesty I felt worse.  My memory was not as good and in general my thinking was not as sharp as it was when I was drinking tea, coffee or eating chocolate that had caffeine in it.  The key as with most things is moderation not elimination of caffeine.  Of course excessive amounts are not good for you, which is why you should limit your daily consumption to about 2 or 3 cups of tea, caffinated soda or coffee a day.  This would be roughly 300MG a day including chocolate etc.  Also I would not consume any caffeine after 4:00pm because it can disrupt your sleep but again it depends on the individual because caffeine effects everyone differently.  Caffeine is not the bad substance that this book would have you believe, if so 90% of the population would be in trouble and they are not.  This book would have you believe that caffeine is very detrimental and should be avoided at all cost.  That is not true and scares people unnecessarily about a substance that is fine if used in moderation 
 We bought it and returned it because of the caustic odor. Tried to clean it but the inside smelled strong. It would be a good ottoman if you had a poor sense of smell.   We also tried buying another to see if the smell would be better. It was not. It's hard to notice in the store with all the other smells. 
 I am a mother grieving for the lost of a wonderful son. During my six month's grief journey I have read numereous books on how to walk this journey.  I was in hopes that Nicholas Wolterstorff's book, "Lament for a Son" would be of comfort and enlightenment to me.  I was wrong.  Instead of uniting the grieving reader with him this book gave me very little comfort, instead it angered me.  Instead of human speak Mr. Wolterstorff gave me academic speak.  I will not be keeping this book, nor passing it on to another one in need.  Respectfully, Hellen Spear, Glendora, C 
 This is double CD--one is a DVD showing the musicians discussing each song with interviews--This is the Allman Bros bass player's jazz group with a fairly decent lead singer on 5 of the 11 cuts--this is mostly jazz music with some guitar solos --I find this CD boring for the most part ...  Allman Bros lovers I would think would be disappointed -its fair at best-too much jazz feeling here-no out and out rock n roll.  I have a copy and will sell or trade it soon-it does not have to be in my collection 
 Favorable reviews regarding this short film are themselves legendary and all appear to derive from the same source.   "Mystic Fire Video" had made an extremely bad copy of Mr. Anger's film and no DVD is available.   But before Sheldon Rochlin died, I sent the retail purchased VHS copies of KA's films back to Mystic Fire; and after a considerable delay, Mr. Rochlin , himself a well known film maker, telephoned me, apologized and replaced said copies at no fee whatever. A class guy. I'm sorry he's dead.  Fireworks is a short B&W silent film circa 1947 regarding a young man out for an evening walk and adventure confronted by the brutality of a group of sailors  Its dream like visual expression makes Fireworks a classic.     
 I picked up "White Noise" with eager anticipation. I've heard Don DeLillo's praises sang loudly from many prestigious sources (the New York Times among them), so I was anxious to give him a try myself. I must say that I am disappointed. "White Noise" has done what no other book has achieved in a long time: it thoroughly aggravated me. It reads like a philosophical treatise disguised as a novel where the author clearly didn't care enough about the novel-ish aspects to flesh them out at all. There's a fake-out premise about a billowing black cloud (or "airborne toxic event" as DeLillo grandly calls it) that leads nowhere except to give the people who populate DeLillo's novel something to muse on for the rest of the book. The characters are uniformly annoying, and while they all have characteristics that make them initially intriguing DeLillo manages to squash any interest you may have had in them by refusing to give any dimension to them. The narrator, Jack Gladney, has earned renown as a professor of Hitler studies; his fourth wife Babette teaches classes on posture and eating techniques; son Heinrich is a moody junior philosopher who takes everything literally and figuratively at the same time; colleague Murray hangs out in the grocery store to watch people eagerly consume products; and more. It sounds interesting (hey, it sounds like a Kurt Vonnegut novel -- and, come to think of it, I'd rather read his spin on these characters any day), but DeLillo isn't really interested in them as people. He only presents them as allegories there to spout philosophical dialogue back and forth. Said dialogue is occasionally interesting and sometimes ground-breaking but becomes too tiresome and heavy, and all too often it feels that DeLillo is straining way too hard to make a point that was specious in the first place. Characters are constantly clamoring for definitions in conversations that come off just as irritating as Bill Clinton asking what your definition of "is" is. All this talk, and what is DeLillo ultimately saying? Another reviewer called this a "stubborn, perplexing" book, and I heartily agree. As I said earlier, there are moments where the fog clears and DeLillo makes a good point (pages 147-149 and 317-320 come to mind) but all too often it just feels like he's arguing for argument's sake. Philosophical novels with allegorical characters have been done much better in my opinion -- see "The Lord of the Flies" or "Animal Farm" for examples -- and with far less infuriating results 
 Easy to see why this book didn't sell very well. Sorry, guys, but the kids in the Metallica t-shirts really did it. No, dem 'der hicks in Arkansas weren't just looking for innocent teenagers to execute 
 It might have been a good book but I got tired of reading the "dis", "dat", "dem" vernacular and finally just gave the book to the local thrift shop 
 In these days of real terrorism, we need real books not rehashed grad school junk.  Put this down and go for current journals.  PL or PU 
 Stephen Mitchell is no Assyriologist - and he's not much of a poet either. His "new English version" of Gilgamesh is rightly not billed as a translation - it is, in fact, something closer to a retelling, and this rendering of one of humanity's oldest and most profound poems is a shameful attempt to Homerize Gilgamesh into a rollicking Western sword-and-sandal saga. Mitchell dispenses with the incantatory rhythms of the original, opting instead for self-conscious postmodernism, devoid of metaphor and, often, sense. His work makes for a text far more remote than the four thousand-year-old Akkadian original. He even divides Gigamesh into an apostrophe and eleven "books", as if it's the Iliad rather than a bunch of broken, worm-eaten clay tablets he's offering up.  The accompanying notes and essays are full of guesswork and shoddy or superannuated scholarship. Worst of all, Mitchell presents a Gilgamesh tale complete and without blemish, even though we have only about two-thirds of it and much of the epic still remains to be deciphered.   Andrew George's $8 synoptic edition on Penguin is a much better buy. George, a scholar not a poet, adheres slavishly to the original clay tablets and ends up with something that - heavens! - actually reads like poetry. Bless him! And damn Stephen Mitchell for having the crust to think he had something to bring to the table of the great and all-too-mortal King of Uruk 
 I don't recall ever being quite as disappointed with a product as I am with the Swing Groover II. Last night I went to the driving range to check some yardages of my clubs, just so I could verify the accuracy of the Swing Groover.       I was hitting my 5-iron between 180-190 yards most of the time, occasionally hitting 200. My 7-iron was flying about 165 yards. Tonight, I just finished setting up the Swing Groover. My first few swings with a 5-iron produced readings of 133 yards. I warmed up a little more and started hitting the 7-iron. These swings produced readings of 121 yards, with an average of 121.      This product is designed to indicate swing speed and yardage hit. The yardage is off by about 50 yards, but believe it or not, I think the swing speed indicator is probably pretty accurate. With the 5-iron, it was indicating a little over 70 mph. I've had my speed tested before with the driver and it registered a little over 100 mph, so this number of 71-73 with the 5-iron sounds reasonable.       I'm not sure if I just got a defective machine or what exactly the problem is, but I'm very disappointed. I'm very inclined to think I just wasted $150.      My suggestion is to keep looking for other products, because this one is horribly inaccurate 
 This is,i belive,the worst "jazz" album i have heard in a while.Save your money 
 The felt on the roller that makes the tracks came off almost immediately. 
 In the photo section there are few too many pictures of movie and tv actors supposed to represent italians. These are mixed in with photos of real Italians. This mix is a little uneven. Also, there are DNA tests now and can be found in books like Spencer Wells's fine Journey of Man book that demonstrate that all Europeans are somewhat neolithically syrian descended (even British Europeans). The author who recently wrote this book could have used these dna studies to illustrate the actual oneness of europeans in having mediteranean ancestry as opposed to the ratty bigotry between supposed southern and northern european groups back in the 18- and early 1900's. But he fails to do so. Some of the Italian history is familiar (like about Garibaldi) but even where it is there are lesser known twists provided. I'd give it two and a half stars if I could

Another crappy album that isn't good for... anything. Doesn't even deserve a 1 star. If this is Hip Hop's future, I swear, I will switch to bluegrass right now.  I'd rather listen to Cher... and Old Dirty Bastard "SING" over screetching violins and banging trash cans than this...  and that's saying something... 
 I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters.  Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.  Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed.  I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best.  Specific example that speaks volumes:  listen to Cohen's singing of his "Hallelujah" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on "Grace" which was recorded in 1994.  Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.  It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy.  "Tant pis, vers le bonheur. 
 Looks like Robert Sabbag couldn't let his sucess with Snowblind be.  This book just sucks.  I know Allen Long and his story is true, the smuggling, the four years as someones maid in prison but Robert Sabbag just got sloppy with this one.  He tried to take a mediocre story and make it into something interesting; didn't work 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better. BOOK WAS OKA 
 Book is out of date with modern economic thought.  Essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets. 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 This book is unbelievably bad.  It is so bad, it is hard to believe that the authors genuinely thought some of what they say is true.  It is unbelievably badly researched, with many "misunderstandings' of basic science and technical jargon.  It strikes me more as an attempt to separate fools from their money 
 I bought this for my 5  year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it.  Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued.  It is a great idea, but needs better construction.  On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her.  However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it.  The drawers work fine.  The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out.  Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out.  Need to be glued in.  
 This book is so dry that I thought that I was reading soda crackers.  If there is valuable information between these covers, it is buried in dust 
 I received the book and CD with hopes to put it to good use for some of my sculpture work. I looked through the book and sent this back without trying the CD because the poses were horrible. The images provide little information that is of any use anatomically or expressively speaking. These poses are so stiff and contrived looking. They are not poses anyone would take in the performance of daily living or activities. Allot of the models are posed so unaturally that they almost look like they are in pain. What kind of results can any artist hope for with such stiff images to reproduce in any fashion? When I pose a nude I consider greatly the position for that particular model. It is no different than selecting the right actor for a part in a play. Some positions are better suited to different individual characters than others. They should be a natural for that part. The positioning of a model should look fluid and natural or should be dynamic in its stress points. Even the poses that are reproducing famous works from the past don't even come close to expressing what the original works have done. The archer pose taken from the great work of the French artist Antoine Bourdelle for example is pathetic. One would gain greater results if they used his sculpture as a reference. At least the concept of harmonious positive and negative spaces and stress , tension, and movement would be better understood. If one is not looking for expression and sensitivity in their work with the human form than maybe this is for them. Maybe they should also consider taking there own video then still capture,of a model on a turntable for reference as I do. It is not that expensive to hire someone for the time that that takes. I hope the originators of this idea considered obtaining the assistance of a qualified professional working in three dimentions for the third edition of virtual pose 
 Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up. I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).  Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest. So naturally i thought this would be the same. The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work. I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book. This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore 
 Reading the book one wonders if Joseph Goldstein has read his own introduction. He tells us a very nice story how a Korean Zen monch and a Tibetan Lama misunderstand each other. So obviously there is a problem with buddhists from different traditions understanding each other. More than a thousand years of different development of Zen and Tibetan buddhism have made it difficult to define the one dharma that unites them both. And there are other schools. Now how does western Buddhism comes in? Can it perhaps help to define this one buddha dharma? Or is it perhaps inventing something new? Very interesting questions, but no answer will be found in this book. It reads much more like a traditional introduction into buddhism written by a western teacher with some emphasis on Theravada. Nothing wrong with it, I liked to read the book, but the title just does not fit. The books of Lama Surya Das are clearly superior in approaching the question of an emerging western buddhism. And hard to beat 
 This book is a review of a very successful real estate company in Canada.   My more then exciting introduction is about how I felt about the book.  There were facts, lots of them but overall no real excitement or much to get the normal reader interested in the book.   I got through about 175 pages before I gave up.   The author tried to punch up the book, but the subject matter did not lend its self to it, there is just noting scandalous or exciting about a well-run company.   This is more of a 400-page case study best left to a university class on management.  Unless you work here or are related to some on that does I doubt you would find much value in this book 
 O'reilly has a grudge against CBS and Dan Rather. After, GI -Joeing it, standing eye-to-eye with the "bad guys" in El Salvador and Argentina, he gets no airplay. Then  with moral righteousness, he goes to a gay vacation place in Provincetown, convinced a "showdown"  was in the making between gays and het families. He gets no airplay. Too bad. Good for CBS.  O'Reilly's "morality" is psycho anachronistic. (e.g. Hollywood directors & celebrities, unless you look like Halle Berry.)Does a Johnny Depp movie really have to have a *moral* message?  He glosses over social and racial issues, and suggests that Al Sharpton, Susan Sarandon and Puff Daddy are misguided &/or dangerous,dishonest rabble rousers. Aside from the Tawana Brawley debacle, I'd have to disagree. The tone is turgid. The writing, junior high. The book is arranged so that O'Reilly always gets the last word after each interview--which is kind of sad-- especially when he interviews his intellectual superiors, like Mario Cuomo. Bill can't play a game without fixing the odds in his favor.  He fantasizes about Hilary Clinton & that's even sadder: "Each night while lying in bed I visualize the interview. At last we are together in the Zone. Her pansuit is peach, her hair is perfect. . ." He tells the reader he has this dream over & over . . .(Quick someone notify the secret service!)  He dares to invoke Jefferson in one sentence, and then decry "secularists" in another. He reacts violently when he thinks someone is not telling the truth, but he doesn't even give credit to his cowriters, or even acknowledge what's shady an dishonest about himself. 
 Only John Kerry would allow a book like this to be printed about himself. John Kerry, the guy who tried to get out of going into the service on a deferrment and when that was denied pulled every lowdown, dirty trick he could come up with including applying for fake Purple Hearts so he could get out early, go home, run a phony anti-war campaign and then run for President.  The biggest insult of all was at the DNC back on July, 2004 when Kerry made that phony salute and  said "I'm John Kerry reporting for duty." 34 years earlier, Kerry was singing quite a different tune.  More like "I'm John Kerry trying to get out of the service on a deferrment." OR "I'm John Kerry trying to rack up phony Purple Hearts from self inflicted and minor scrapes so I can get the heck out of here and go home."  As if Kerry's military background was not a myth, we now all know that his supposed academic prowess was also a myth. While Kerry claimed to be an A student, in fact he was a D student. And that great speech that he made in 1971, supposedly prepared by Kerry in the wee morning hours with little preparation was in fact written for him by Robert Kennedy's speechwriter who had been coaching Kerry for months. But why be surprised? Has Kerry ever told us the truth about anything? Answer: No!  What happened to that big draft Kerry said was coming for sure in January 2005? And how about those reduced social security benefits for our seniors that republicans were supposed to  install according to inside information that Kerry had? Looks like the only draft is between Kerry's ears and just last week our seniors got the second biggest raise on their social security benefits since Bush I was president and raised benefits back in 1991.  So is Kerry misinformed or just a flat out liar? Check out the heroic military image that he created for himself. Does that tell you something? It's not rocket science.  
 I have a couple different editions of the Penguin Jazz Guides, and while I don't have the Seventh Edition of the CD Guide, I feel I can say a few things in general.  The Good Things: Very informative.  Filled with information.  Tens of thousands of recordings, categorized alphabetically by thousands of artists, with catalogue numbers, labels, years, etc.  There will be many people you have never heard of unless perhaps you are a decades-long serious devotee.  Even then, I doubt anyone could ever be really familiar with all these musicians.  A lot of info.  The Bad Things:  Filled with information.  As someone else astutely pointed out, I'm not sure for what exact purpose you could really use all this information. All you can do is look up a specific artist and see a listing of (usually all or almost all) their recorded works.    That's great, but then what?  I myself am only a very casual and not-terribly-knowledgeable collector of jazz recordings, but I know that I am limited in what I can collect by what I can actually find.  Therefore, it doesn't do me a lot of good to have a complete discography for, say, Carol Kidd.  If I am interested in the complete works of Carol Kidd then I am probably already pretty familiar with her works.  I would have to be if I was collecting her recordings in the year 2006.  But I'm not a huge Carol Kidd fan.   Conversely, if I run into something I would want to add to my collection, like, say, a 1st-edition near-mint LP by Gil Evans from 1964, then I wouldn't need a guide to know that I want it.    I admit that's a petty gripe because the book still makes for excellent recreational skimming by nerds like me, but there is also the issue of critical judgement and omissions.  For example, ever heard of Bobbie Previte, the obscure drummer?  His complete works from the mid-80's are listed.  Ever heard of Nina Simone, the famous torch singer and pianist?  According to my 1998 edition of the Penguin Guide she was not a jazz artist (although Rosemary Clooney apparently was), and is not even mentioned anywhere.  Vince Guaraldi and other similar West Coast/cool jazz artists are diminished or flat-out dismissed, upholding the longstanding tradition of New York snobbery in contemporary jazz criticism.    And don't even get me started on the typically snide and out-of-touch comments contained in the Jaco Pastorius entry, which border on outright defamation against Italians.  In the end, I would advise a slightly (or more) dedicated jazz fan to buy a good CHEAP used copy of this guide and see what you can squeeze out of it.  You will learn something, but don't expect too much besides trivia and minutiae 
 The iShock II WILL NOT work on Intel Macs, and per Macally' website, they have no intention of releasing an Intel- compatible driver for the iShock II.  Don't waste your time on his product like I did 
 Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety.   Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack free will.  And then there's the "protagonist," Homer Wells. I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems more real than Homer does.   The story is very long and rambling. Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with Debra Pettigrew).   After such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters 
 Anyone armed with a high school world history textbook could have written this highly disappointing book.  My message for Mr. Fromkin: tell me something I don't know!  For beginners, say at a middle school or high school level, this book may teach you a thing or two.  For lovers of world history who are looking for rich details to expand their knowledge of the subject, this book will leave you wanting and quite bored.  It has all the basic facts that you can fit in 200 pages.  Perhaps Fromkin's other books are better, but I'm not going to take that chance.  When discussing European domination of the world leading up to the First World War, he states, "The world was won; the world was one."  Brilliant!  Let's give this guy a Pulitzer Prize!  Folks, save your time and money 
 Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden.  As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world.  And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming "YOU are killing us!" - us?  And where does this emotion come from.  No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike?  Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained.  Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream?  Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?   
 I ordered two of these. For the first one, neither the firewire nor the USB worked on my iMac G5 (MacOS 10.3.9). A copy would start, and then hang after a while. I returned it and the second one worked using USB, but the firewire would hang like the first one.  A friend has one that works fine with his iBook G4 under 10.3. 
 I read Mouse Tales twice in a two week period.  I could barely get through this book!  There were pages I skipped because I found it so boring.  Being that I read Mouse Tales within the past couple of months, I saw repeated statements in More Mouse Tales.  It seems as if the author ran out of things to say, so he found employees (or many former ones!) to trash Disneyland and to blow the lid off The Happiest Place on Earth and it's politics.  Disneyland fans do not need to know this.  I would rather be oblivious to the nasty politics, backstabbing and other [stuff]that goes on there.  Disneyland is there to make people forget this gloomy world - not to be reminded of it as this book does 
 This game is pretty fun but it takes forever to put it together before you can play it. My 5 year old wants to play the game immediately. Not wait 10 minutes for mommy to get it ready.They now have an electronic Ker plunk game. We will be purchasing that one soon 
 This book was so hard to follow I sent it back, and I have read and enjoyed a lot of books that are technical in nature or historical in nature.  As I tried to go through this book I was bogged down at once in jargon fit for AD 1600.  Not the kind of thing I want to wade through for reference material or anything else.  There are a lot of other books out there which cover this material and are a lot easier to read

 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism 
 "Cyrano" is one of the greatest verse plays ever written.    Unfortunately Gerard Depardieu is no Cyrano.  He's a great, clumsy side of beef, not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of Hercule Sevanien Cyrano de Bergerac.  With the best will in the world, his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance.  The English translation was especially commissioned for this film.  It is undistinguished, prosy and dull.  It has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great American actor Walter Passmore.  Get the Jose Ferrer version.  This one's a dog 
 If you're looking for ammunition to disprove popular conspiracy theories this is not the book you need.  This book is primarily concerned with Christian conspiracy theories based on speculation concerning Biblical end-time prophecies.  The author, apparently himself a devout Christian, comes out squarely against these theories, feeling they create much fear and hopelessness among believers and are therefore contrary to the teachings of Christ, if not his apostles.  As for the more generally known conspiracy theories such as the JFK assassination cover-up, the McVeigh as fall guy for a larger plot, the massacre at Waco, he says very little to put the issue to rest except to list these theories along with a group of other theories which he thinks very little of and therefore dismisses.  He does uncover a few facts I was unfamiliar with.  For example, Janet Reno was moved to okay the Waco attack out of an extreme concern for the children allegedly abused by Koresh.  Why it was better for them to be dead is not part of his treatise.  Altogether, the book was disappointing to me because I expected a worthy rebuttal of theories which have been bothering us for so long.  Instead, I learned a few interesting tidbits about how various Christian groups or sects have interpreted the apocalyptic messages of the Bible 
 Horror fans,don't be fooled! Notice how most if not all the good reviews on this page are written by reviewers who only have one review in the catalog. That normally is a tell tale signal that it was reviewed by someone who was involved with making the film. That must be the case here because the movie I watched was so aweful that no armcheer reviewer in there right mind would give this piece of trash anything more than the one star they are forced to give here at amazon. This is the type of flick that makes any respectible horror fan cringe with anger & makes you wish that you had the little bit of money these folks had to make this mess 'cause anybody with half a brain and a chunk of imagination could have come up with somthing ten times better. There are plenty of backwoods horror films (both low-budget straight to dvd and big screen) that are light years better than this useless waste of time,$ and space. It isn't even a "SO BAD IT'S GOOD" goof-fest. This is just a sad insult to horror fans so don't be fooled by the phony good reviews. 
 I understand the reason why it is written in such short form, but I hated it. It was way too much. Way over the top.  It makes for such a difficult read.  The book was pretty dull anyway. Not much happens here 
 I used this video in the 90s and got rid of it after a while.  Now I am back into fitness and got the DVD based on the previous reviews.  When the DVD came, I sat to watch it first and could NOT get past the cheesy chatter, costumes and outdated routine.  It may work, but home fitness has to be enjoyable and for me, this was definitely not.  Try Tamilee Webb's recent stuff instead, like "I Want That Body" and her newer CardioBlast.  Great, not cheesy, and very effective 
 Enven in March the calendar was not available. i had to purchase from another brick and mortor store for $1.0 
 I'd like to start by saying how amazing New American Gospel is.  Then by saying what a solid follow-up As The Palaces Burn is.  Lamb of God is truly one of the best American thrash/metalcore acts.  However, If you enjoy either of their first releases, I would recommend skipping this one.  It's disappointing and generic.  If you're considering buying this and don't own the previous albums, buy them first.  Lamb of God is an aggressive, technically skilled band, and I really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one 
 There used to be a time when philologists had an intimate knowledge of world literature. For instance, if you read Erich Auerbach's classic "Mimesis" you enjoy the book of an grand old man of letters who like a souvereign displays his careful and passionate readings of the classics, and gives you thoughtful reasons why Homer could not survive. Compared to this grand old tradition Victor Hanson's book is thin-lipped and merely offers cheap polemics. One misses refinement and culture 
 Gee another Steven Segal BOMB, wonder what this guy is thinking about??? The story takes place in Poland and a little girl whom Seagal has befriended via penpal has been kidnapped for prostitution purposes.Seagal arrives in Warsaw and single handedly fights the Turkish mob which is behind the above mentioned prostitution ring.The finale is laughable as Stevie being fat and old as he is, proceeds to kill the bad guy witha sword!!!!  Steven it is time 2 retire my boy 
 I didn't think I'd miss the Christopher Reeve superman movies (one and two at least) and I really miss George Reeves now!!!!  Those black and white Superman shows were the best!  what's her name was a HORRIBLE Lois Lane!!!!  The whole thing sucked - that was the second of two bad movies in a row!  I don't even care about the deleted scenes!  I want to sell it to someone else or at the very least - I'm going to give this one away!  Brandon is cute enough but that uniform was soooooo dull!!   I remember now that my brother told me I could wait for cable.  I got greedy - someone bought him a DVD that was coded for another country (there was russian writing on it) and it wouldn't work in my DVD player so I got Amazon happy and ordered it from a vendor in Brooklyn.  I SHOULDA WAITED FOR CABLE 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Like some of the other reviewers, this was pretty much the first book I ever read on the subject, but later as I studied more, I discovered that Wilson has so filled this book with bias and irrelevancy as to make it virtually useless.  It's only saving grace is that so many players in the game are namechecked that the interested student will at least know where to look.  There is also the final chapter, "Glimpses", which might have made a good small book on its own, with its discussion of "Faculty X", that I rather liked.  On the whole though, I can't say that the brand new edition is worth it--you'd be better off purchasing this one from an Amazon Seller 
 This is more a "life coach" book than a management book. It is filled with suggestions that are pretty much common sense. If you are a manager you should already know all this stuff!  
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 "In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise.  If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two.  I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced.  Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling.  Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
 out of the dozens of horse racing books i've read, this one is undoubtedly the worst. the entire book is written in a third-person perspective... the author refers to his wife throughout the book as the "dominant female." not once or twice, but EVERY single time he makes reference to her. this might have been clever if it had been done a couple of times spread throughout the book but [it's not]. this book also confirms the cliche that "every dog has his day" because it is amazing that this [guy] could have been a managing editor of a major newspaper, and could have bred the kentucky derby winner monarchos .. 
 I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first.  But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.    My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda.  The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 The Petersen book is a cut above from the anti-Mormon fare, not engaging in the more out-dated claims offered against the Book of Mormon, such as the inane "adieu" and "Land of Jerusalem" argument critics offer against Book of Mormon antiquity, notwithstanding such claims being outdated for several decades now. However, it fails to engage with Book of Mormon scholarship that reveals that it could not have been fabricated by anyone from the 19th century.  The question of Book of Mormon material culture arises in the text, but such arguments have, too, been answered and have been outdated for some time. I suggest one to track down "An ancient American setting for the Book of Mormon" by John L Sorenson to see how plausible Book of Mormon material culture (e.g., flora and fauna) is in light of its ancient Mesoamerican setting.  Petersen fails to answer questions that critics have been obfuscating from for some time now. For instance, how did Joseph Smith know so much about Arabia? How did he know of the presence of a continually flowing river south-south-east of Jerusalem in Arabia, when, for decades, critics have derided such (and, in their ignorance, continue to do) as an impossibility 9see 1 Nephi 2:5-8)? How did he know of a burial site, *NHM* in the same direction, corresponding to "Nahom" where Ishamel was buried in 1 Nephi 16:34? Furthermore, on this point, lime altars have been found in this region, attesting to the historicity of the name and burial site pre-dating the Book of Mormon volume, serving as the first archaeological evidences attesting Book of Mormon antiquity. In addition, how could Smith have known of a lush garden spot east of Nahom, and describe all its physical and material cultural characteristics, when, again, critics have derided Bountiful in Arabia as another impossibility?  In terms of Book of Mormon antiquity, I am only scraping the barrell. However, this should be suffice to show that critics have some way to go before they will be taken seriously by knowledgeable Latter-day Saints.  I welcome feedback at Robert.S.Boylan@nuim.i 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 These are not only not the greatest closing arguments in modern law, there are barely competent.  Okay, maybe this is a slight overstatement--I liked Spence on Silkwood, but the rest are lackluster.  The title should be, "A few ponderous closing arguments given in high-profile cases.&quot

 Coles'study is ambitious in scope, but it is this ambition which ultimately proves to be his downfall. While he ably sketches out a broad overview of the history of African American writers abroad, the brevity of his study does not allow him to do more than skim across the surface of these rich texts. Perhaps if he had limited his study to Europe or Africa or produced a much longer text, he might have been able to deal more adequately with his subject matter. In addition, the datedness of most of Coles' sources make it obvious that this is merely a superficial update of a 20 year old study rather than one rewritten with more recent critical work by Paul Gilroy and many others in mind. The subject is deserving of a major study. Unfortunately, Black Writers Abroad is not it 
 If you are interested in this book, good chances you have a child with Asperger Syndrome or PDD-NOS. You should familiarize yourself with these topics before labeling him/her an Einstein 
 I hated this book.  It says quite strongly that if you're not meeing ALL your spouse's needs ALL the time, they may "fall victim" to an affair.  It is a kind of emotional blackmail.  None of us is perfect at meeting our spouse's needs.  While I encourage communication about these needs, it is awful to use any shortcomings (which we all have) to justify a spouse's straying 
 It was an awkward mess - smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered, much less fit securely.  It'd probably be easier without the trays.  I don't know if they work or not.  I gave up.  I want my Crest Whitestrips back 
 Woodrow Call and Agustus McCrae are very young men, just embarking on their adventures as Texas Rangers when this book takes place. I have to admit it was rather a disappointment. "Lonesome Dove" is a masterpiece and, in a way, I think McMurty should have left it at that. He uses the central characters from "Lonesome Dove" in "Dead Man's Walk", and, especially in regard to Woodrow Call, it just doen't ring true. I just can't see Captain Call of LD as the same Woodrow Call in DMW, particularly when it comes to his relationship with Maggie. Captain Call was a solitary individual,emotionally remote. I don't see this struggle in DMW, or any reason for him to turn inward later in life and to deny his son. The ending of the book seems rather abrubt and far-fetched. If you can separate the idea that these are the same characters from LD, you may enjoy the book on that level. As westerns go, it is an okay read 
 It only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs.  Doesn't run well over pine needles or leaves.  (Make sure to rake the yard before riding!) The acceleration in slow, the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens.  I spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing.  It stops when the child tries to make a tight turn.  All of this was on the grass-it was advertised as being rugged off-road capable, when in fact it only works on the paved driveway.  Don't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person...it's been 3 days and still haven't heard! 
 This book is actually worse than Lahaye's deeply disturbing and nonsensical "Rapture" series because it masquerades under the guise of "scholarship."  Of course the book it claims to be analyzing can only be proven true by refrencing passages in that book that claim that its true.  So, borrowing a tactic from our all knowing Heavenly Furher Jesus:  THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS TRUE: Christians are full of **** and shouldn't be allowed to publish books.  You read it so it must be true 
 This book is a constant barrage of difficult names and convoluted information; and too little organized information on his battles. Suddenly your there and then gone, thinking, well it said something about it was a  benificial out-come for Frederick--didn't it? It was a mess, really--I read  only half. Two stars because of the topic 
 Both the book and the film is full of exaggeration, revenge and hatred towards Turkey and Turks. Only 30-40% of the story may be true which I am pretty sure would also be the same in many countries 36 years ago. All the rest is full of lies. But portraying one of the worlds most interesting and beautiful city like it was is a real shame and pitty. I am a Greek living in Athens who visits Istanbul and beaches at the south of Turkey with my family at least twice a year and know what I am talking about. I don't know anyone who was in jail but dealt with police a few times and everyone was always nice and very helpful especiallyy to foreigners. 
 jihad only for in defese of islam not murders this book insults muslims as dogs we live and work to eat and happiness we are not animals and men who seek truth read koran not this book lies enslave the mind insults to islam not freedom of press but hat 
 ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS, PAYS THEM NOTHING, AND ROBS THEM BLIND. DO NOT PURCHASE BOOKS FROM THEM OR FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. BOYCOTT THESE THIEVES!! 
 If you wish to read something for entertainment's sake, then this book will suffice. Written by an English Professor, this book lacks the sort of critical thought those of us in the science deptartments want for. Purportedly an 'Abbreviated History Of Western Manhood,' it is rather an exercise in academic arcana - an attempt to think of something through its opposite or, in this case, its abuse. One is hardly compelled to reconsider ideas about what manhood means. There is nothing in Taylor's "treatise" to support such nonsense as, "This is a specter that has haunted men for centuries: the fear that manhood will become, or has already become, obsolete, superfluous, ridiculous, at best quaint, at worst disgusting." Really? In whose misandrist manifesto? The concept "Western Man" is, after all, just that - a concept. There is no such unified and homogeneous group and no such "specter" has haunted it for so long. That men should cringe at the word castration is less a mystery than than why women should fear rape. In short, Taylor's analysis of the history and purposes of castration sheds less light on the "cultural construct of masculinity" than on the sadistic sexual abuse and humiliation with which males can be threatened and subjugated. That some of his readers find him witty or funny at times is only because Taylor's treatment of his subject is often sophmoric.    In my view, today's attitudes toward manhood and males are best understood in terms of our lacking moral sympathies toward them. Taylor's book is no exception. We are not a generation influenced by Freud so much as by feminism. Thus, the historical abuse and mutilation of women is a subject deadly serious and pertinent to us while the sexual abuse and humiliation of men is treated like something that never happened - that is, something we've misconstured, or, in Tayor's case, given a fictional reinterpretation, mocked and trivalized. Taylor's ignorant belief (not first person, of course) about the sexual prowess of eunuchs is one case in point. Another case in point is Tayor's view that for most of western history castration was a mark of power and divinity and, as the ultimate abrogation of sexual desire, had wide spread currency among Christian metaphysicians. This is nonsense. Taylor is arguing anecdotally to his own foregone conclusions. He wasn't there to take any polls. No doubt, some Christian cults managed to appropriate practices of sexual mutilation already in place - just as Christian nihilism helped to make slavery seem worthy. This did not, however, make such practices any more agreeable as hardly anyone wanted to suffer either condition  themselves. In any case, the spiritualized feelings attained by some Christian monks through self mutilation would have appalled the Greeks - the paragons of western civilization - as it has most men throughout all of human history.   Taylor's book about castration will score a few points for the concept of cultural relativism on a subject that now seems, at best,  uncontroversial or, at worst, comic to the immature. Should he chose to write volumes exploring the gamut of humanity's attitudes regarding every other form of sexual nastiness, he will no doubt find endless tolerance to be feted as well. Would he dare? 
 This book is just horrible... anti-marriage and anti-man.  If you're bitter and you want your daughter to grow up the same way, then this is the book for you.  Otherwise, opt for more wholesome entertainment 
 That is all the author did was take declassified FBI records and wrote a book. Most of which the information about WD FARD and Elijah Muhammad were contradictory. Wish I had the time to elaborate. He should be ashamed of writing such. Sad 
 This is the worst teensploitation film I've ever seen. The jokes are flat and uninspired. There is absolutely no new ground broken here. Not a single memorable moment, with the exception of a slow motion scene in a woman's shower room.  But if it's skin you're looking for, hasn't the internet made movies like this obsolete? Why do I need to sit through 100 minutes of dumb plot and jokes that are all dead on arrival when I can take two minutes to do a google search for Vida Guera 
 I didn't read, nor review this book, Stand Up Comedy, but apparently LaMott A Jackson blieves that I did, as he/she chose to drag my name into his/her review.  I thought these were reviews, not forums for trashing other reviewers' names.   I would never mention anyone else by name, but I chose to do so here because LaMott A Jackson chose to berate me personally, singling out my name from other negative reviews.  It sounds like LaMott A Jackson has a personal interest in the selling of the book "Stand Up Comedy".  The book I did review however was Judy Carter's "Comedy Bible", so if LaMott A Jackson  would like to add credibility to his/her review, he/she should have gotten the review of the correct book. I have not read "Stand Up" by Judy Carter, nor would I want to after reading the lame "Comedy Bible".    If you are going to review a book, do that. Most reviewers do refer to other reviews' comments, but without stating names. Please LaMott A Jackson, submit your review of the product as everyone, but leave out the names of other reviewers.     
 Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.  I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.  This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.  Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.  The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.  The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.  Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them 
 Boo-Wop? haha ok, anyways I bought his through Middle-Piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. The problem is the singing and the overall production. This is definetely a home-recording on computer deal. The vocals are waaaaay weak. What exactly is a "re-worked" debut album??? I thought once an album was out it was done, set in stone? Apparently not,so mister monster gets to pull a Blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. A definete step up from bands like Blitzkid,but still in the cellar of rock n roll. Do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years 
 I thought I would really like the book after the first chapter, but I wanted to read about Las Vegas and its characters. I didn't want to read a book about politics from a liberal point of view that happens to take place in Vegas. WAY too much political commentary for my taste, and I only found about one third of the chapters interesting. The final chapter is just a Christian bashing bore and left me wondering why I had bought this book 
 When you decide to adapt a classic film you should take warning several aspects: Has the story aged? How has the suspense's concept altered for the new audiences?   We know about the professed sympathy of Cimino for Rourke. We saw him in The year of the Dragon. And somehow Mickey doesn't look credible as the distorted mind criminal. He is too rational and cold to represent that hard character. The illumination is another serious problem. The whole drama looks extremely theatrical: Anthony Hopkins looks uncomfortable with the role and Mimi Rogers is inexpressive. Elias Koteas is simply out of context and perhaps that's why the insipid dialogue. Maybe David Morse shows certain wild tendency. There is a rigidity in the dialogue. Obviously you assist to the common places: the internal disagreements in the policy procedure. Lindsay Cruise is assertive in this role. But the initial sequence of the getaway is terrific. It looks too artificial and the viewer' adrenaline simply is not emanated. The sumptuous photography saves the film of the collapse. The music didn't help to maintain the suspense. It is not easy to readapt a classic film of the fifties. Something similar happened with Cape fear `s remake. The question might be around the new approach of the suspense and the new technologies. Bogart looked extremely old for the role and Rourke looked too elegant to be a convincing ex con.  Good entertainment for teenagers in a pop corn rainy weekend.          
 Considering all the hoopla surrounding the comments made by Larry Summers, I am surprised that Mansfield hasn't received more bad press. Here are some choice quotes from this 'work of scholarship' so lauded by others:  "One has only to think of Jane Austen to be assured that women have a sense of humor, distributed in lesser quantities to lesser brains."  "Men can spit, cuss, tell dirty jokes, read porn, and drink beer. Modern women are doing their best to catch up with men in these attainments, and they do seem to have made modest progress in cussing, I say condescendingly."  "There are worse things than being a sex object."  Sure there is plenty of research to argue against Mansfield's sexist propositions. But he conveniently denounces the entire field of empirical psychology in the first two chapters, thereby sidestepping the issue entirely.  Furthermore, his discussion of the advent of a 'gender neutral society' makes him sound a bit paranoid. Perhaps he's spent too much time cloistered in liberal academic circles. Anyone paying any attention to politics these days can tell you that most Americans do not believe that men and women are interchangeable.  The book would have deserved less criticism if it did not denounce entire academic fields (e.g. social psychology, evolutionary biology) in order to make its point. Instead of taking the viewpoint that, "You have your opinion, I have mine," Mansfield instead tells anyone who disagrees with him: You're wrong! Such a stance is hardly convincing. Mansfield is like a schoolyard boy pulling feminist pigtails and jumping up down saying, "Look at me!" Creating controversy may sell more books and create some excitement around an otherwise boring academic life, but it takes us further away from having intelligent conversations about gender differences today 
  "Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" as it says on both the front and back sides of the CD?  Give me a break!  As another reviewer wrote on Jan 10, it is disappointing not to get a movie soundtrack when you pay for a movie soundtrack.  I bought the CD to listen to Olivia Olson's (Joanna Anderson's) "All I want for Christmas is You."  Of course, the track is not the same one as I heard when I saw the movie.  In the movie she sings her intro without background music.  On the audio CD, there is unwanted background music clutter from the start and, to my ear, it only gets worse as the piece progresses.  When will the recording industry set standards voluntarily, clearly spelling out on labels and advertising any soundtrack substitutions?  Or, do they prefer to wait for more government regulation?  J Records, a unit of BMG, shouldn't expect any more business from me anytime soon 
 We read this book in ILA and it was so boring! The character had no emotions and it was very slow moving with no excitement. I almost fell asleep. DON'T READ THIS BOO 
 shaver is bulky, sideburn trimmer is not attached to shaver, cool skin additive is very difficult to use for a person with rheumatoid arthriris. I would have exchanged it for a different model except it is to difficult to repack and mail back 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
   This is not to fault the vendor from whom I purchased this item used, the price as new was even more. And not to question the information enclosed therein: it's probably fairly accurate and all that. But to use the word "book" as a physical description is misleading. Try a handfull of paper squares with a couple of staples banged into the middle and folded over. I've seen free handouts with a more substantial construction. A fair price for this should be somewhere south of 3 dollars I would guess. Or better yet, the information should be up on a website where it can be viewed and downloaded for free. (Hmmm, there's an idea)   So do what I should have done if I'd been using my noodle. Go to the reference section of your local library and use the copy machine. And take the money you saved and buy a real book.    
 im usually a big fan of catherine coulters books but this book just left me speechless and disgusted. beyond what the character had to handle from the so-called hero, the rape scene just was inexcusable. i didnt and dont understand what went through coulters head when she decided to put such a brutal and descriptive gang rape--it left me nauseous and disturbed.  i was, and am, incredibly disappointed in coulter for this book. honestly when i first read the scene i was waiting for the hero to come to the rescue because it was truly too unbelievably vile. i shudder that coulter made use of such a terrible topic in her novel, something that shouldnt be talked about to sell books. 
 Yes, the story is pretty unbelievable, very much in the same class of the works of Fleming, Cussler, etc.  However, it is not the story or the character development that makes this a below average read.......the author really needs to change editors.  This book could be improved immeasurably by a better job of good editing.  Way too wordy, too many extra pages, scenes, action, etc, that do not add anything of value to the overall story and do much to impede the flow.  Did the author get paid by the word? Get a bonus for going over 300 pages?  Editing, editing, editing.      
 This is horrible to the point of tears. This CD is career ruining. If this were widely released (was it?), I don't know if we would be seeing the AMAZINGLY talented girl we see now. Stripped & Back to Basics are NOTHING short of IMPRESSIVE. I can't IMAGE the music industry without this talent, so thank GOD this wasn't released! WOW!!! 1 star because there isn't a "0" option! Sorry Christina 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 It's quite amazing that this book is a business best-seller.  The book contains nothing new and, in fact, the 17 so-called "laws" are just overblown statements of the obvious. For example, in the Law of Significance, the author "explodes" the myth of the lone ranger by stating that "the belief that one person can do something great is a myth."  Really? In the Law of the Big Picture he says, "people who build successful teams never forget that every person on the team has a role to play and every role plays its part in contributing to the big picture."  Another insight?  I could go on. However, equally important, the book does not contain any new research or even interviews with key team leaders. The conclusions, such as they are, come from secondary sources such as the popular press and the author's personal examples, none of which seem to be based on any real business experiences.  I returned the book to Amazon 
 These glasses are very attractive to look at but they are too delicate for every day use. I broke one while washing it after just several uses and haven't used the other one since. They will sweat a little bit when holding iced drinks 
 I have first hand experience dealing with Ms. Morgen. I paid for and attended one of her 3 day courses. I even did some work for her. I was really excited to work with her at first, until I found out what kind of person she truly is. I totally agree with Gill's comments. Although many of her concepts have validity, I've seen her *not* use the same type of "we" space she advocates. I won't be specific, but I can say with certainty that I've never had a more unpleasant client experience. Ms. Morgen can be very rude, abusive and confrontational. Her opinion is if you don't agree with what she says then there must be something wrong with you. I would recommend this book for some helpful cold-calling tips, but I would not adopt Buying Faciliatation as my primary selling technique 
 Starring Tony Perkins perfectly miscast as a major league ballplayer. What can you say? The Red Sox have Jimmy Pirsall, Tony Perkins and "Fear Strikes OUT". The Yankees have Lou Gehrig, Gary Cooper and "Pride of the Yankees".  
 After reading A Fine Balance I couldn't wait to read another book by this author. I then read his third book called Family Matters which was good but I was disappointed as it by no means compared to A Fine Balance. I just finished Such A Long Journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots.  It is my least favorite of the three books by this author. It's hard to believe that someone can right a book like A Fine Balance, which was magnificant and one of the best books I have ever read, and then turn our stuff that is, at best, average.    
 This is not a 2 quart sauce pan, it is 2.5 quarts, exactly the same as the one that comes with the se 
 The skin is fine and all the extras were nice. The one thing I really needed was a good elastic band for the arm. This product does not have a good elastic band. It's too thin and not durable enough 
 This is probably one of the most annoyingly worst albums I've ever heard in my life.   What is this? If you like this, than like it. But I just can't see what situation I'd ever be in that could call for something as annoying as this.   In the woods?  Nope In my car?  Nope On the ocean?  Nope I really just can't figure this kind of music out.  and I listen to wacked out music...but...I don't know man. It may be a New England thing or something. Yo.  I found this really cute album.  Oh....ohhhh....yeeah. Worst ever 
 My fifteen year old is using this book in LAUSD high school so I was confident that a book by an old Exeter professor would be more than adequate. I was wrong. Had Brown walked into an Exeter classroom with this book thirty-five years ago we would have nailed him spread eagle to a Harkness table. I bought my kid a copy of Weeks and Atkins, the book used by my prep school teacher Arthur Weeks and Brown himself when he taught at Exeter 
 This film comes after THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (1974).  THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977) is the third Bond film for Roger Moore and the 10th film in the "James Bond" series.   Bernard Lee returns as "M", Lois Maxwell returns as "Miss Moneypenny", Desmond Llewelyn returns as "Q".  Walter Gotell who appeared in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE (1963) returns as a new character "General Gobel", a role he would play until 1987.  He was also the voice of "General Gobel" in the cartoon, "James Bond Jr" (1991-92).   A Russian submarine has been downed.  Agent XXX is called upon by general Gobel (Walter Gotell), however Agent XXX (Barbara Bach) is in bed with Agent Sergei Borzov (Michael Billington).  James Bond (Roger Moore) is also called on duty and he too is in bed with a woman.  Well off he goes and the woman is working for the other side.  Bond needs his skis to get out of this one.  (Best breath-taking stunt ever filmed, uncut).  Bond has an opponent to find, Stromberg (Curt Jurgens), who likes sharks and feeds his betraying agents to them.  His helper is "Jaws", a giant human (Richard Kiel, EEGAH! [1963].   This film will take you to the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx in Egypt.  Geoffrey Keen played "Fredrick Gray", the Minister of Defense.   Robert Brown played "Admiral Hargreaves".  He would later play "M" in 1983-89.   Assistant Director, Victor Tourjansky is the man on the beach drinking wine.  he also appears in MOONRAKER (1979) and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (1981).   Although the end of this film mentioned James Bond would return in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, that movie project was put on hold until 1981.   The next movie filmed actually is: MOONRAKER (1979).   A new 007 Studio was built so sets could be built at a great scale including holding the submarines.    DVD Special Features: "Inside The Spy Who Loved Me" 41-minute documentary.   "Ken Adam: Designing Bond", 22-minute documentary about the production designer.   3 movie trailers, 6 television spots, 12 radio spots for "The Spy Who Loved Me".   Photo gallery, Audio Commentary.   Movie is shown in squeezy widescreen.   This film was released on July 7, 1977. (007,007,1977) 
 I kept on plowing through this book because I was sure it would get better, but it never did.  It reminds me of a really well-made film--you can admire its artistic merit, but it's no fun at all to watch 
 Every once in a while, I'll buy a book I know nothing about.  Usually I end up being pleasently surprised.  This was not one of those times.  I'm a little confused by all the great reviews this book has received.  If you believe the message of this book (find a man to have great sex with and in doing so you will find true love and happiness) than this is the book for you.  Romance readers will love this one, I guess 
 Format hard to follow, print is very, very small, hard to read. Did not find it helpful in planning my trip to Iceland. This book was not useful to me at all. Next time I purchase a travel book, I will select it from a bookstore. Some books are fine to purchase on-line, but not for something like this. I was hoping it would provide details on how to plan a trip to Iceland, tour guides or self guided. 
 Michael Hirsh's "At War With Ourselves: Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World" is a though-provoking argument for increased American involvement in world affairs.  However, rather than pursuing the unilateral policy that the current administration favors, Hirsh insists that America should become more active in what he refers to as "the international community."  He maintains that only through more active participation in the international community can America continue as the "berpower" of the modern world.  Hirsh's primary claim in "At War With Ourselves" seems to be that if America were more involved in the international system, the world would see us as its protector and ally rather than its enemy.  He asserts that America has an obligation to the international community because this community itself is of America's own making.  He also devotes much of the book to the hypocrisy of America's foreign policy: he claims that while we advocate widespread democracy, we shy away from the implementation of this policy if it does not suit our purposes. Hirsh is a good writer, with a style that is easy to read and easy to follow, but he has one flaw-many of his arguments are simply weak and contradictory.  He excels at including data and facts-but only those that suit his purpose, leaving out the other side of the argument.  Or worse: he often seems to be "at war with himself," arguing one side of an issue in one chapter, only contradict himself in a later one 
 Unless you are proficient in statistics, this book will be very frustrating for students. I have trouble finding adequate explanations and definitions, and I am supposed to know this stuff. Their are numerous editing mistakes which adds to the students frustration, and could someone provide an answer key to the assignments. It reinforces the inability of some to understand how and what students need to learn. 
 TALKING ABOUT A MISSCAST. SAMUEL JACKSON CAN PORTRAY A HITMAN, A PIMP OR A THIEF, BUT A PHARMACOLOGICAL GENIUS, YEAH, RIGHT 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 Leaving aside the validity of Marxism, which Taussig takes for granted, this book is one of the worst I've read.  Taussig's work is so convoluted and difficult that almost everything has to be read multiple times.  The really disappointing thing is that after reading the book carefully from cover to cover, the only conclusion I was able to draw was that Taussig writes in such an impenetrable fashion as a way to cover for the fact that he has very little to say.  Don't waste your time or money on this book 
 This book is a real letdown.  As other reviewers noted, he wasn't running a typical hedge fund strategy.  He just bought and held tech companies, either public or private.  And he did this during the .com boom. He had the sense to wind down the fund before the crash. Gosh, he made a lot of money. As I think he himself says, never mistake talent for a Bull market.  You don't find out much of anything about his approach, because I don't think there was much too it.    The chapters jump around without much coherence. He seems to be building up to a point, leading to a big 11 page section that entirely in italics, in case you were going to miss it.  We have higher margins than the developing world, so the trade deficit doesn't matter.  That's it.  One of the least interesting books I've read this year 
 This is the second Vault guide that I have read, and the second disappointment that I have had with this series.  I really isn't a career guide at all, just a very short back ground on what IB is.  You can find a description of IB on the internet for free.  The only redeeming value is the "day in a life of", but even then, there are only a dozen pages or so.  In all, you can find most of what is in the book for free on the internet.  I won't be buying any more vault products, as they have little information, and more pages of ads for other vault products than pages of usefull information 
 This movie has some excellent acting, starting with the always wonderful Michael Caine, and some very funny moments, but it lacks one important ingredient: a script.  The story beings promisingly and then just slowly evaporates. Worth watching if you are an inveterate Caine fan or feel nostalgic about that Caribbean island you visited. 
 Many of my friends and I have read the same book.We come to the same conclusion of this book having an agenda to dogmatize our country with meaningless gender bias.In my opinion there is nothing more dangerous to a country and the world as to limit  our children's ability to wether the child is male or female. Gurian does not offer any proof as others have stated in the  reviews as to how these differences come about.He says it's the hormones,the brain structure.I have read other matierial which has disclosed findings which condradict his so called research. If he were correct in assuming hormones then I would be much more drenched with testostrone than my half brother since I excell at math and he at lanuage.Brain structure varies from person to person,something I doubt he would like you to know. Instill independence and individuality in all your children  by seeing them as people rather than sexes. I cannot think of anything worse than leading your child down the wrong "learning style" road,simply because of their sex. People tend to want to agree with anything they read  and be  a good follower.It's better to think for yourself and be a  good leader and helper in your child's life by giving them room to grow the way they want to and without trying to controll  their interests or believing they will only show talent in small sterotyped boxes.Terrible book written by someone  who is trying to distort your child's life to make $$$$$$ 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 I'm sorry to say but I just couldn't get through this book. Read about half of it, but I'm not into long meandering descriptions. If you want a plot that will carry you along, this is not the book 
 If you have a lot of extra money to spend on plastic, pre-made, self-watering containers, then this is definately the book for you!    There is ZERO information in here on making your own self-watering containers, save for the advice of using a "ready-made insert".  Personally, I don't have the energy to extrapolate the info herein, and then, McGuyver-like, invent my own self-watering containers.  And I certainly have better thing to do with my money than buy plastic pots designed for stay-at-home suburban-organic moms with too much money.  If you don't have money to burn, instead get:   "Moveable Harvests" by Crandall and Crandall.  Their soil mix recipes haven't failed me yet.  I disagree with their preference for hybrid vegetable varieties, but nobody's perfect.  "Bountiful Container" by McGee and Stuckey (if you can overlook the cutsey post-menopausal twitterings [waa-ay too much info on edible flowers], there is a ton of info in there)--  Or, if you're a Gen-X urban gardener- "You Grow Girl" by Gayla Trail.  Gayla ROCKS 
 I guess if you wanted diagram jokes like an english teacher this is a good book to learn from but, don't expect to get any laughs. This book is a difficult read and I flipped through half the book just to get to something I could enjoy reading. Maybe all those five star ratings are his family members and friends. Comedy is about being fun, having fun and the ability to make people laugh. This book was about none of these. $18.95 up in smoke. I normally would not even take the time to write a review but, maybe it will save somebody else some money. I read "Stand Up Comedy Virgins" by Paul Stoecklin and it was a fun read to learn from. Try (...) for what I consider to be the best Standup education 
 The author has a decent touch with action sequences (few though they are in this book). And he seems to have a real affinity for martial arts which comes across in his writing and enriches his story. But he is very akward at moving the plot forward and constantly depends on groups of characters sitting around dicussion what happened. "Why did this clue appear earlier? What is the significance of this event? What trends should we see based on events so far." Very clumsy style which veers into Hardy Boys book territory. But when he finishes explaining everything that's happended so far he writes competently. If you got the book free and like the genre it's worth reading on a plane 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 98% of this thin book is about how many buttons a certain uniform had on it and what type of boots a certain unit wore.  Almost nothing about the Italian Army of WWII was in it.  A more appropriate title would have been "The Uniforms of the Italian Army 1940-45: Africa" 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Me and my wife bought the JVC camcorder and burner set up to send dvd's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time. At first it worked great then after 2-3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc. We have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10. We returned it to get another and it did the same thing. WE thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal. I do not recommend this to anyone 
 Mobb Deep have been grinding since I can remember.  Even in the early days of The Infamous, they were known to the true hip-hop heads but struggled to be acknowledged from the mainstream and had modest sales on practically every album they put out.  Now they sign their life away for a paycheck with Blood Money, an album the puts the loyalty of all Mobb Deep fans to the test.  It's not like Mobb Deep had this impeccable rap career that was ballin' out of control or something.  After the lackluster showings of the mediocre offerings of Infamy and Amerikas Nightmare, Mobb Deep had hit a wall with their career.  Most other artists would have ended up back in the hood wondering what happened to their career.  Luckily for them, 50 Cent had a lifeline for them and they became millionaires overnight according to them.  However, they'll have a tough time convincing the masses that Blood Money is worth the paper it's printed on.  The few standout tracks include "Speakin So Freely," "Daydreamin'," and "Put Em In Their Place."  "Outta Control" (Remix) with 50 Cent is a good '50 Cent' song with Mobb Deep bringing up the rear with their cameo appearance.  "It's Alright" with 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige lives up to the song title when it comes to judging how good this song is.  Some of the worst stuff has to be "Creep" with 50 Cent, "Have A Party" with 50 Cent and Nate Dogg, and "Pearly Gates" with 50 Cent (figure out the pattern here?).  Other wack joints include "Capital P, Capital H," "Backstage Pass," "Give It To Me" featuring Young Buck, "Click Click" with Tony Yayo, and "In Love With The Moulah."  Mobb Deep has never been this wack before.  They definitely don't need 50 Cent's expertise to put together a decent album, but I guess they need 50's checkbook to line their pockets.  Who can blame them?  Wouldn't you put out a wack album for a million dollars, even if it turned out to be Blood Money 
 This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against.  The first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x. Do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x,  increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good.   The finder is useless, smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30.  Finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating.  The low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope, depending on its design and field of view.  That the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing.  And don't even think of using the 4mm (high power) eyepiece or the barlow.    I do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners.  Their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography, and for this they require careful setup.  The equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress naïve buyers with its complex "scientific" appearance.    In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope.  Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.  Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on Amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.  For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: "So you want to buy a telescope. 
 Would that it were true that family relationships came down to the words we use when we talk to one another. Tannen tries to wrestle complex family dynamics into conversational styles, and fails dismally. Much of the "insights" are superficial, suggestions for improving relationships minimal, and the examples provided are tedious and boring. I had high hopes for this book but it provided little that was useful to me 
 Ashley is The World's Greatest Christian in Silicon Valley! She will tell you so herself within the very first pages of the book - and keep telling you how wonderful & Christian she is as she shops at Prada & Ann Taylor in her Audi TT convertible.   I got very tired of the snottiness, hypocrisy, and very superior attitude of Ashley. She judges everyone in her life as inferior while she's God's Chosen One. So shallow and critical of others - what a great example of a Christian in the world 
 I was really excited to read this book when I bought it, but was pretty disappointed by the end.  First, it is not science fiction.  Second, although the characters are well drawn, the story is just not that interesting.  Finally, and the most important drawback, the ending really sucks.  There is no resolution, so you feel like why did I go to the trouble to read this if it doesn't go anywhere.  Overall, I finished the last page feeling very unsatisfied 
 There is no doubt in my mind that Josh Harris is a good person, who sincerely wants to help people, particularly young Christian women, who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene. However, he doesn't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.  Either he's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case, considering how influential this book has become.   Is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?  No.  For the vast majority of singles, the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.  Few couples have actually gotten together this way.  The real reason why this book, with its overwhelmingly female readership, has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN, as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS.  Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that "rises to the top" for Christian singles.  Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from "God's plan" for their lives, many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math, but certainly feel the lack of male attention.  Unfortunately, this often gets boiled down to some kind of "passive Christian guy thing", but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage, whether it's New York City, Post-war Russia or your local mega-church.  It's not so much a lack of male leadership, but a lack of males.  And so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single Christian men, who they greatly outnumber.  Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel, many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice, the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference.  Which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill, fuelling a Christian singleness industry with its own slogan "The Gift of Singleness" that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness!  Of course, their lack of contentment (an innate response that tells you that things don't add up) is something they are told to repent, ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship.  But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that's the result of the Christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings, there'll always be a market for Christian self-help books like this one.  Pure genius!  What's more, there are "unintended consequences" that can go along with Harris' model for "courtship" that he doesn't really address:  1) Because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy's intention to marry the woman, it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him. This can have several sub-consequences:  (a) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk (getting turned down for a date is bad enough, but imagine having your "potential marriage proposal" crash and burn!) (b) It fosters prolonged crushes, as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is "the one", he might not ever do it (c) Ironically, it can boost up the guy's expectations in terms of a woman's looks. Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads (that yes, this is the kind of woman I want to marry) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who don't LOOK like whatever their "wife prototype" might be. Guys who date and don't make a big deal of "a date" are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways (In "How to Get a Date Worth Keeping", Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses weren't really "their type" when they first met).  2) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides. Serial dating (as practiced in Latin American countries, where a guy will ask out tons of women, get turned down by most of them until he has a "short-list") teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex. You ask your way down your "ladder of options" until you find your equal (likewise for women, in terms of dealing with the facts about who's asking and who's not). With courtship, a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years. The idea that it's better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is FALSE. You're better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend (a real human being with chunky thighs and all) than with the evangelical Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence!  3) It reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex. It reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles.  4) It's unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal (which is essentially what courtship is) on her without any prior notice that the guy (who's had a head start on working out his feelings) is romantically interested. Most Christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them, let alone entertain the thought of marriage.  5) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle, who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like. Kind of like, "he's a nice, sincere, Christian guy and he wouldn't be spending this kind of time with me if he didn't think of me as marriage material, right?"...not always so.   If we are to stand back and take a look at it, the whole courtship redux really hasn't gotten off the ground: it works for too few people at this time. Maybe the world has changed too much, or perhaps there are other issues today's Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first: such as the confusion about "the gift of singleness" and the shortage of men. I would recommend Debbie Maken's Getting Serious about Getting Married: Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage, instead of this moldy oldy. 
 Somewhere in "Blues Legacies," Angela Davis the Activist and Angela Davis the Scholar collided leaving both worse for wear. This is a powerfully stated, well-intentioned study that loses focus and credibility  by screaming, rather than supporting its ideology. Davis argues that three  foremothers of American blues music, Ma' Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Billie  Holiday, offered up a version of black, working-class feminism through  their songs that emphasized self-suffiency, personal pride, and admitting  one's shortcomings. These value, the author asserts, sprouted into the  feminist conciousness of the 1960's, largely coded as white and middle  class.  Davis thorough knowledge of black musical criticism and exhaustive  study of the three artist's lyrics makes this central assertion a  convincing one. From here, I waited for her to place it in a historical  context and ask some tough questions about the role of women in popular  music which would tie the study firmly to contemporary discourse. It never  happened. Davis hammers this feminist assertion into submission for nearly  200 pages, never letting it mature beyond simple declaration.   The role of  black feminism in the 20th century is under-explored and long overdue. Yet  the author never grants it the weight it deserves. How did this black  feminism figure into the process of composition since Rainey, Smith and  Holiday wrote very few of their songs? How did these Artists influence  their children from the Shirelles to Tina Turner to Salt n' Pepa? The  potential for answering these important question is all over "Blues  Legacies" yet Angela Davis keeps getting in her own way. A scholar  shouldn't have to choose between their message and their scholarship but  this case, a frustering collision might have been avoided 
 I found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion (not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford).  The whole magazine is one big ad.  If I wanted that, I could just turn on the tv 
 This is supposed to be a gripping thriller about a medical examiner slowly uncovering a bioterrorism plot when a rug dealer turns up dead from inhalation anthrax.  Cook's medical background means the scientific details are (mostly) accurate, so the book has that going for it.  The plot has a neat twist at the end, but is still pretty cheesy.  And the book was a quick read, which was good in this case, because the writing was so clunky, stilted, and inane that I could hardly believe it got published!  Characters are cartoon cutouts whose traits are laid out for us so we don't have to figure it out for ourselves.  Dialogue often has to serve to explain scientific and medical background, which means it doesn't sound real (a more skilled writer could have finessed it, I think).  And weird levels of detail were inserted for no real reason.  Finally, a bizarre little lecture as an author's note simply restates the obvious.  This could have been a much better book if only Dr Cook had given his readers a little credit 
 This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary! 
 This was the single most atrocious example of a "text book" I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  Very poor editing throughout, and often the outline structure was unnavigable.  Adding to that problem, was poor grammar and sections that simply made no sense.  "...incentive programs are effective over long periods of time as long as they are not dropped permanently at some point."  My suggestion, if you have a class that requires this textbook, find a new class 
 His central thesis has been answered by everyone from Daniel Pepes and Shabtai Teveth, to Ephraim Karsh's new book "Fabricating Israeli History". He fabricates  whole JAE speeches, mistranslates texts, and  literally concocts a "Zionist Mythology" straw man to destroy. He  fails. REad Karsh's book 
 Promises made & never kept, this book is about a marriage of the soul w/yourself.  Nothing really to do w/finding a lover, a mate or a friend. It's all about the relationship you are having w/your soul before you can possibly go & find a mate. Very heavy reading. I felt like I wasted time 
 This book is OK at discussing real-time cinematography techniques in general. It is not good at all at tying it into something that can be incorporated into games. There are no algorithms, no mention of what specific software packages or scripting languages to use for specific techniques, and absolutely no math. Every time the book gets to a point where it would need to get into details, it just refers you to some other book. Usually, it's a different book every time, so to follow the author's directions you would wind up with an armful of books besides this one. Thus, this book is really just an introductory novel on the theme of real-time cinematography with the "for Games" thrown into the title to hook the game programmer/developer into purchasing it. The problem is, there really isn't a great book on this topic, although "Digital Lighting and Rendering" by Birn comes close. For a book on image processing with more of a mathematical touch you could look at "Digital Image Processing with Application to Digital Cinema", although that book doesn't get into real-time issues or games at all. 
 Maybe my expectations were not set accurately, but I wasn't looking for a touchey feely book that simply repeated the same silly message for 161 plus pages. waste of money and time.. now I am going to have to rush and play catch up with all the work I missed while spending quality time to read this dribble 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums 
 We bought this boat 4 years ago when my oldest (of three) was a baby.  I totally agree with the others who have said that it is tippy and not safe.  We only used it a couple of times because he would just pitch forward or from side to side.  We used it when he was between 5 and 9 months old and able to sit up, and still had this problem. Maybe an older, much more stable child could use it, but it is advertised for use with infants and it's just not worth the trouble of trying to balance your baby in this thing 
 The premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.   I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum 
 I was looking forward to gaining some real insights with this book.  However, it is one of the most disapointing books on the subject I have read.  The infomation is dated, the size of the book is pitifull. Trying to remain objective, there are a few handy formulas for detailed calculations, the rest of the information here is old news, and all available for free on the net. Ed has, in the past written some of the best and most well known material on this subject.  But this book is just not worth buying.  Ed Rosenthal where has your integrity gone 
 I finally opened this book after many years on my shelf to help me in my quest to tell my adopted kids that I have made contact with their birthmother. What I read was a lot of anger, stories of unsuccessful reunions, and a feeling that an adopted child can never reach peace with either family. I refuse to believe that is true, but that is how the book comes across. Some points in the book are excellent, but the negative was just so prevelant. 
 The quality of the recording is awful, which is not necessarily the weakest point of the album, as a matter of fact it lends aa appealing dusted, kitch effect to the music.  The music seems to have been performed by ... semi-amateurs indulging in a recording session - it might be interesting for psychology students to gage the effects of... induced creativity.  I do not dislike the album, I just think its merits are less musical than not.  Amaon II albums are considerably better 
 This movie was just horrible. It takes place in an amusement park for one. The action was weak, the story line was weak, and the ending was just silly. Watch this film at your own risk!!!! 
 Having worked on Wall Street for 25 years, by and from experience I can assert that ANY economic behavior by any human does entail a marginal error toward/from the misinterpreted phrase "zero sum game.Simply research historic Federal Reserve monetary policy to understand this, let alone structured finance! Prof. Thurow's point is that the US political economy, its citizens, and those "elites" who make its policy are asymetrically informed. Sooner or later, the US has to restructure its misapplication of redistributing wealth; hence the shock of the 70's, the long-term mess Regan has left; the stock bubble of the mid-90's; the current housing bubble.  Another shock a la 1973 and 1978 might redirect this country's "elites'" thinking towards more long-term pragmatic lines 
 Those of you hoping to track down the director's version of this film, don't get your hopes up with the "unrated" listing among the technical specifications.  This is still the 95 minute R-rated rush-release, it just doesn't list it on the packaging.  The director's cut (apparently  available only in Region 2) runs 111 minutes.  
 The principle question that arises from a reading of "Soul by Soul" by Walter Johnson is why was this book written? It is touted as history, yet not only does it lack any original historical material, it  also lacks any discernable historical facts. Rather than history,  "Soul by Soul" seems to be a mean-spirited, emotional tract  designed to promote two fundamental ideas: 1. that white people living in  the antebellum South were universally loathsome, brutish and cruel and 2.  that black people living in the antebellum South were universally noble,  good and abused. To support his views, Professor Johnson strings together a  loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist  literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings. His personal  contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche  of the book's long deceased characters and divine their true, but unspoken,  motives and thoughts. Quite a feat for any historian!      One loses count  of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using  their "probing fingers" in this book. Fortunately, in between  probes, the reader can be shocked by the "killing fields of the lower  South," the "historical sexualization of black bodies," the  "slaveholders' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of  their slaves," and the "brutish perogatives of whiteness."  This is heavy, hate-filled stuff worthy of a TV mini-series but it is out  of place in a supposedly serious history text.       I live in a former  slave quarter in New Orleans. In the antebellum period, this building and  its resident slaves were, interestingly enough, owned by a free black who  was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation. As an  amateur historian, I would have thought that a book about the New Orleans  slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these  markets. What were their addresses? What percentage of their customers were  black? What percentage were white? How many slaves did the typical New  Orleans household have? How were they fed and clothed? What were their  working hours? These are basic questions that should have been addressed  but instead, the reader is given an emotionally charged, repetitious,  boring rehash of tired, previously published material. In short, this book,  for the most part, reads like a rambling, overly long sermon. Anyone  seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look  elsewhere and should consider reading the "Slave Narratives"  compiled by the Federal Writers Project, "Time on the Cross" by  Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman and "The Slave Trade" by Hugh  Thomas. The first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves  performed by the W.P.A. in the 1930's. The latter two works contain  original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery, not  the emotions 
 I bought this book in the expectation that it was going to describe the rational foundations for irrational exuberance.  I was most disappointed to realize that it was just a collection of rather anecdotal comments on a few stories of poor business management (e.g., Enron, Worldcom).    However, not even the commentary is insightful - it only scratches the surface.  I actually think that the title of this book is highly misleading - it is not about how or why market bubbles are created.  Rather, it is a book that very succinctly describes stories of high-profile companies that have coincidentally had their day during times of market bubbles.  To speculate that, for example, Enron and/or its well-paid executives have been the cause of the 2000-2001 NASDAQ crash is to ignore fundamental human psychology and behavior.  Overall, there is no real need to buy or even read this book.  It's unlikely to enlighten any reader wanting to understand the background to the stock market collapse of the 2000s 
 Let's see - I graduate from law school at age twenty, work as an attorney, a real estate developer, venture capitalist, and a banker over a span of about thirty years. Then I get sick and am out of work. When I am ready to return to work, I, through a large network of past contacts, just happen to get a job teaching college courses, which leads to writing books and appearing on national TV shows, and which, in turn, leads to forming consulting businesses including life coaching. And, of course, my advanced degreed wife takes a well-paying job at a magazine as a cushion. Then I hold myself up as an example of how the typical person can launch a second career and put it all in a book, SECOND ACTS. So the reader learns early on that the author cannot distinguish the irrelevant from the situation of most attempting to make a career change. Furthermore, it is an irony, which the author little sees, that he did not depend on the exercises that he recommends to others in finding a second career. He actually stumbled into most of what he calls a second career. Is that the real message: get lucky.   Of course, what would a self-help book be if it didn't have any number of exercises that must be followed to find a second career. First of all, one is to write about their dream: passions, strengths and weaknesses, interests, needs, and the specific dream. And then there are the typical obstacles of which one must be cognizant: age, money, duration, consent, location, physical condition, education and training, timing, esteem, fear of failure, fear of success, and fatalism. There is a subtle message here that failure to launch a second career may be due to your failure to overcome these obstacles - like they are not really obstacles after all.   This is the wrong genre to look for a realistic description and assessment of the world of work and training and education for it. If employees were actually empowered and if students could get educated and trained without tremendous amounts of extraneous hoop-jumping, perhaps all of these books about how to deal with work and workplace unhappiness would not be necessary. Issues such as obsolescence and downsizing could be dealt with realistically taking into account the interests of all parties. Changing the content of one's current job would be possible.   Chances are those who are doing what they absolutely love: painters, writers, wood carvers, etc aren't reading this book. For those who have struggled in the world of work, the typical self-help platitudes are here. Their help is doubtful. The author can hardly change workplace realities. When careers or jobs are changed, there is a very real possibility of experiencing the same limitations as before, just in another guise.  Adding to the irrelevancy of the book - the author insists on adding numerous mini-biographies of celebrities which have absolutely nothing to do with finding a second career as most would understand the concept. Furthermore, those writing a serious book on general employment need to keep their personal lives out of it. If one wanted to read memoirs, one can find plenty. 
 I have owned the S410 camera for almost two years, when on New Years Eve I pulled out my handy camera, from the padded case it's always in, and to my horror, the E18 error message appeared! It hasn't worked since. I paid $400 for this camera and Canon would like $110 (plus taxes) to fix the problem - ridiculous. Especially since this seems to be a VERY common problem with their cameras. I've enjoyed the camera's picture quality and ease of use, but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years! Beware of this flaw that Canon doesn't seem to acknowledge 
 It's hard for some to believe, but it is what it is. Christianity is not what it was 50 years ago, which is not what it was 150, and so on. It is not the same religion it was during the crusades, nor the inquisitions. It changes with the times. It is a creation of man and controlled by man. Christianity itself is an evolution of judaism. People should be content with people who are kind and caring and good hearted, despite any religion or lack there of they may have. 
 I bought this (luckily, used) based on the excellent reader reviews I read here on Amazon.  I could not have been more misled.  This is one of the worst self-improvement books I have ever read. It is bad beyond anything I could have expected, so bad that had I not gotten my hopes up for a good read with some good advice, I probably would have fallen out of my recliner laughing.  This book is a very thin gruel of other writers' ideas, dumbed down for the sort of reader who finds literary satisfaction in  romance novels. The substance of this book is nothing more than "If you write down what you want--and keep writing it down, if necessary--you'll get it."  Hmmm.    "Hmmm" is right.    Hardly anyone these days isn't familiar with the earlier New Age incarnation of this idea--writing affirmations--and anyone who has read the writings of the Founding Fathers of motivational self-improvement (like Napoleon Hill) has seen it as well.  Far, far too much of this book consists of anecdotes.  The anecdotes range in their effect from soporific to nauseating.  Take "Gloria's" story, for example.  An entire chapter is devoted to Gloria's search for love, for a husband.  She writes letters to a "soul mate" that she has not yet met.  Among her puerile love-maunderings, she writes a description of the soul mate she hopes to meet:  He is a "beautiful" dresser, and has "Strong hands, deep integrity, and spiritual truth," and a gift for "making and having money." She doesn't want the money because she's high maintenance and loves to spend; no, she wants the money "for the joy, love, peace, and bounty it can bring the world."  (Uh, yeah, sure Gloria.  Clearly you're one of those unfortuate individuals who believes her own bs.)  After two years of writing this sort of pabulum to herself, Gloria goes to a bar, gets picked up by a lawyer, and marries him 11 months later. As we all know, lawyers typically possess exactly the sorts of qualities she was looking for in a soul mate, so this outcome is hardly surprising....  The book doesn't get any better than this, and there is even a short chapter at the end of the book to help you rationalize the failure of the techniques (for lack of a better word) described between the interminable anecdotes.    Most importantly, the advice simply doesn't work.  This book really is a silly piece of nonsense.  Skip it. 
 Look up the ingredients yourself.  I foolishly bought this for my bikini line, because what good is hair removal if it is replaced by bumps?  But, after I got it and used it (it did work a little) I noticed that it is mostly alcohol, a little aspirin, another ingredient common in any moisturizer and then Propylene Glycol...which is the main ingredient in antifreeze.  Save yourself some money and go buy a 50 cent bottle of rubbing alcohol....I did, and it works just as well 
 Okay here is my indepth review.   I have little flies of some sort in my Hydroponic vegie greenhouse. I bought this seemingly easy little hunk of plastic to make a sound that's only bothersome little animalsand bugs hear.   4 days after purchase the little guys seem to be flying to the ultrasound. The jig and bop back and forth like they are dancing....I bet they are dancing, making love and reproducing to the Ultrasonic waves!   I killed more bugs inhaling while plugging this in my Green house.   Rather then take it back I suggest you huck it at a Black & Decker Exec as the are robbing us telling us this thing works. On the box they site a study but don't show it's reference. When I called BD they said, "We don't know what study that info came from". They are hornswaggling us! This is gonna be big like Enron! Corporate Karma!   Update- 7 days later. I really wanted to give this product a chance as I'm lazy beyond belief and plugging stuff in is right up my alley. If I have to go buy Lady bugs or pest spray I'm gonna be pissed.  SOOOOOooooooo I bought 4 more and plugged them all in for 3 more days in my small greenhouse...... not a damn thing happened. Actually I think it works like a rave and extascy for the flies. There are more of them now and they seem to be having much more fun!  So in conclusion, This thing sucks more then the suckiest thing that ever sucked a suck. Only buy it if you need some extra plastic hanging from your outlets. 
 Total waste of money. Once plugged in it locks up the computer. Got in touch with Seagate, and apart from an e-mail welcoming me to the Seagate "team", I've heard nothing since. TigerDirect, with which I've had good success up to now, will not accept a return - must go through Seagate, so be careful if you buy from Tiger 
 I don't know why Amazon is still pushing the 3rd edition 4 months after the release of the 4th edition, which is much superior!  The 4th edition is available on Amazon as well, but you have to look elsewhere for the large print (Walmart online has it) 
 Like other people have said, this book is pretty short.  To make matters worse, it repeats itself a lot and wastes a lot of pages with boring code such as using 3 pages to show a POJO (plain old java object) with nothing but getters and setters.  Did they really need to show that?  This book is an ok introduction to hibernate, but definately isn't worth the price.  A lot of the same information can be found online, and this book doesn't really present the information in a new or useful way 
 A dissapointment. Sadly, neither of these actresses were wearing masks in this film.What in the hell happened to Kelli McGillis? Don't expect to see anyone even closely reminiscent of the sensual Top Gun actress of long ago. McGillis is simply wooden in this role. Susie Porter is somewhat of a toad who appears to be wearing the same outfit throughout the movie's entirety. The acting is poor, the frequency of obscene language is distracting, the storyline is silly and the actresses chemistry is as romantic as a mud sandwich. Don't waste your time with this one or you'll end up feeling like a monkey 
 I was not really impressed with this CD.  The previous 2 CDs(Mission to Please, Eternal) were so much better.  R Kelly is a great producer, but did not write the best songs for the Isleys for this.  2 Bad !!! :(  Isleys were better off with Jam and Lewis from the Eternal CD.  Listen and Buy at your own risk 
 I love a good, fun, guilty pleasure type read as good as the next woman but this book had no point.  It was just silly.  It is fun to read books with these funny and extravagant characters when something actually happens.  This was more of a childish running commentary.  I got to the end and just wondered why even waste time writing something like this?  
 I haven't seen the show, but I certainly hope it works better on stage with visuals than it does listening to this tepid CD. Not a memorable note of music in the entire score 
 it was after reading the book.  I've read six chapters into the story, up to page 71, and have not found one relevancy, one single human insight.  If the author is merely working up to something, he has taken far too long to do so.  The book is littered with details of fact that show a strong reliance on a mind capable of memorization, rather than thought.  The details are ones oriented to the setting and medical practices of the time -- neither of which offers me anything.  I feel the author would have done better if he had researched less and thought more; he covers no new ground, and all that is said by his characters are dumbed-down generalities of the subject material.  In fact, the character of Nietzsche quotes himself to the praise of the psychiatrist -- I cannot help but feel that the author, rather than create significant characters of literary worth, relied on the weight of his chosen historical personages to do the work for him.  Another flaw with the characters is that they all speak with the same voice, have no personal stamp other than name and minor habit [such as Freud smoking a cigar].  If the book were non-fiction it would be titled, 'A Brief Summary of the Beginnings of Psychoanalysis, Featuring an Overview of the Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.'  This is all besides the point that the premise of the book is preposterous for reasons that I think are obvious if one is familiar with the writings of Nietzsche. This is an unbearable work of pulp and does not deserve the time of any reader seeking literature 
 The Quest was one of the movies that began the descent of Jean-Claude Van Damme from a major motion picture star into a straight-to-video movie star, which still is better than most actors accomplish, but far from the level that Van Damme achieved at the height of his success.  The Quest is a poor ripoff of Bloodsport and Kickboxer about a martial arts tournament with Roger Moore thrown in for comic relief. While there are some good fight scenes, they don't make this film worth watching or buying. Fortunately, Jean-Claude made many more that are worth watching 
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 I was not pleased with this cook book. Despite all the positive reviews I was disappionted. When I first saw the recipe using a can of soup I knew it wasn't for me. I do love the Sopranos but as far as cooking goes I will look elsewhere for my Italian recipes. 
 This book is terrible.  It is very hard to understand.  Not recommended 
 This book is mediocre at best. It offers invalid practice tests and too broad of a summary on each thing. It doesnt pinpoint what is on the Ap exam very well at all. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. The best resource is the textbook by Miller. When i bought this book, it took 3 weeks for delivery and is more expensive then other publishers such as barrons and princeton review. I knew that these small unknown publishers would not meet up with my expectations and         i though i was proved wrong with these miraculous reviews. Trust me, you wouldnt be a "smarty pants" if you buy this book. 
 I live and work in the Florida Keys and found Ms. Williams book to be overly critical and in some cases, grossly inaccurate.  Ms Williams seems to be looking to find fault instead of enjoying what is unique and wonderful about this area.  Or perhaps it is easier for one to criticize than to appreciate.  Ms. Williams is a fiction writer as well...perhaps this is just another work of fiction because her descriptions don't resemble the Keys I know and love 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 First of all, this is not a Christmas anthology.  This is 4 stories that just happen to occur in December.  Christmas isn't a big part of the stories -- at least not the first two, which was all I could read before I added this to the pile of books going to the used book store.  Adair's story had good suspense with a serial killer bent on finishing off his victim from a year before and agent Joe Zorn bent on preventing him from doing it.  This should have been a longer story to allow more character development and longer build-up to the climax of the action.  Banks' story was a disappointment in light of her previous books.  Her novels are usually full of sensuality and this one was sorely lacking in that department.  And it wasn't particularly suspenseful either.  After two disappointing reads, I decided to pass on Britton and Roberts and move along to the next book on the TBR pile.  If you're looking for a good Christmas read, this isn't it.  I only give it 2 stars because it's well written.  Blah, but well written 
 The rafter jig idea was great, but there just wasn't enough info and detail to actually build it (I thought).  I must admit, I'am not a pro as this book "by pros for pros" claims, but I guess if I was a pro, then I would probably find the information in this book to be too elementary.  This book is ok for learning roof basics, but it's not enough info and detail to fully learn all that's involved with building roofs 
 How dare the record company call this "The Best Of" without qualifying it with the label 1985-1999?  I'm surprised Clapton himself didn't put up a stink when they released this as it is clearly only a representation of Clapton's songs from the 80's onwards of which 90% were awful and showed the wrong direction Clapton headed.  There is no sign of the magic he recorded in the 60's and 70's.  The missing magic songs include: After Midnight; I shot the sherif; Let it Grow; Cocaine; Promises; Lay down sally; and of course the original rock version of Layla.  To find all these classics, look for the far superior compilation "Cream of Clapton".  And remember, after midnight we're gonna let it all hang out. 
 Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:  http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
 Before this misguided book was published, DDT was successfully reducing malaria deaths across the globe.  After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly.  For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.  Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.  Do not buy this boo 
 This one's going back to the store.  It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat.  If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat.  As for the "massage", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu.  I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet 
 The authors of this slim volume have collected some charming old photographs of people with their dogs.  Identifying the subjects was nearly impossible, so while they sometimes had a date to go with the picture, they rarely had much more.  So, they paired the photographs with quotations from diaries and memoirs, seeking to more fully describe the meaning of the picture.  Unfortunately, and surprisingly for historians, the quotations are often from another time period.  I wish they had trusted the images to tell their own story.  I also wish there was some kind of informed presentation about human relationships with dogs over time.  Veterinary practices were much different at the turn of the century for example, and certainly impacted how animals were treated and regarded. The formatting of the pages is visually awkward, and sometimes the reproduction of the photograph could have been more skillful.  This is a cute coffee table presentation, but not much more.  
 I was very disappointed in Nikon's service.  This camera has a 2in LCD display that apparently is very fragile.  When I returned for service, Nikon claimed I dropped it... which I didn't!  I was very careful in handling this camera, but the fragile LCD still broke.  To be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing.  They offered to repair it for $210, nearly the price of a new camera.    I will NEVER by a Nikon product again.  If they are going to sell such a fragile product, they should at least include a hard case for it. 
 A friend who knows my taste in music recommended VNV Nation to me, so I got Matter + Form based on the reviews.  In one sense I like it.  The production is excellent and I find every track to be creative and unique.  But I HATE the vocals and so I can't bear to listen to the CD.  This dude has the worst voice in music history.  
 NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)!  Not liking the negro portrayal in GONE WITH THE WIND,Alice Randall therefore created her own version, a parody of the acclaimed southern classic.Therein lies the problem.  The trouble with parodies,it so intertwind with the original that it can be used as a sequel,a retelling or a new story with characters copied from the original but this time superior while degrading the original.So much so,readers begin to accept these false truth as the true truth.Not openly but in disguise, words like "what if" & "perhaps".Why?Because people always like scandals to famous chracters fiction or not.When that happen, a novel,even w/ the purest intent and purpose,gets butchered.  Here are some cases to prove my point & where the book failed:  1.THE PARODY/CONCEPT ITSELF-The whole purpose of this book is to show negroes aren't dumb and capable.If you read GWTW,as others call it"White-washed"&"Romantized",is in fact a love story.Plus Mitchell was trying to show how a civilization changes after a war,what better way to illustrate it than the old south?  But why portray negroes like that? Obviously these fools didn't see Aunt Pitty,Hugh Elsing or Ashley.Aren't they white,helpless,pathetic and idiots?  If you read GWTW, What about the courageousness&modesty of Pork,The industriousness &loyalty of Dilcey?What about Uncle Peter who single handly raised Charles&Melanie,who looked after and Protected Aunt Pitty?What about Rhett and Scarlett declaring Mammy as a smart old soul?Aren't these persons Negro and admirable traits?  2.MAMMY KILLING THE 3 SONS-In p.663 GWTW, a yankee tells Scarlett "do you think i can trust my babies to a negro?" She thought otherwise,and now Mammy kills Gerald's sons.Its thesame as saying negroes can't be trusted and they kill white babies and Randall was trying to show Negroes in a different light.This damages her&the book's credibility.Noble as her intent,but no good can come out of evil means.Its better to kill 10 people than 1 baby,as the saying goes.  3.GERALD/MAMMY-Check the background story of Ellen/Gerald.There can be no doubt of his fidelity.It takes a great deal of emotion for a person to get unhinged after a loved one's death.  4.CYNARA-She is an exact copy of Scarlett even their ages are thesame but this time she smart,beautiful,brown,a good mother compared to Scarlett.She even has Scarlett's strength & Rhett even prefers her.Ridiculous!if Rhett likers her than Scarlett he would've married her instead,or divorce scarlett after he have is way with her,Rhett boast of being ill-bred so his rep. wont matter.Why this nonesense of mistress and after death marriage?  The book,despite being well-written,feels like a parasite after reading created by a first-time author who wants instant fame,fortune making others accept and embrace that her work is better while destroying others hard work. If you want a book about the attrocities of slavery then buy UNCLE TOM's CABIN which is BETTER than this one.  NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)! 
 I grew up reading the Chip Hilton books and loved every one of them.  A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books.  If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important.  The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times 
 I got this because I like jazz and Pink Martini.  I'm pretty disappointed.  I guess I was expecting something different.  I'm not that thrilled with the vocalists.  The arrangements strike me as odd.  Several tracks are a lot more electronic than I was expecting.  I was shooting for something more natural and recreative of a scratchy Paris-in-the-50s jazz album.  
 I found this a difficult book to read.The author uses long meandering sentences frequently enough to distract attention;and her thesis is unclear.The author also tends to make generalising statements,with no evidence to back the statements up.The book does not say anything new;I was disappointed overall 
 I own "Howl's Moving Castle" amd "Spirited Away" by Miyazaki and bought "Nausicaa" mainly because of the customer reviews. "One of the Best Films of Any Type Ever Made." "Greatest Animated Film of All Time." "Best Movie I've Ever Seen." Please help me! This film story is about a young female heroine (who can't afford underpants) with a good heart and a desire to stop all killing in a future world dominated by giant worms. And a worm is a perfect mascot for the tedious, snail crawling pace of this film (everyone viewing almost fell asleep). The plot is slow to develop, character development lacking and animation primitive at best. Of the three Miyazaki films I own, this is the worst. Does it matter who wrote the screenplay? When you put your name on it, it's yours. "Howl's Moving Castle" and "Spirited Away" (which won an Academy Award) have qualities that are totally lacking in this film. These films had characters who's evolution touched my heart, a storyline which captivated me and animation that made me forget that this was animation. Not so with "Nausicaa". The reviewer who claimed that this is "One of the Best Films of Any Type Ever Made". has obviously never seen "Gone With the Wind", "Ten Commandments", "Ben Hur" or even "The Wizard of Oz". The reviewer who stated that this is "The Greatest Animated Film of All Time." has probably never seen "Dumbo", Pinocchio" or the new "Over the Hedge" or "Open Season" (the animation of the bear fur is beyond realistic). So if you're an animation freak like I am (and not someone who's been paid by Miyazaki to praise his inferior work), who lets the eyes and heart decide what's a good film and if you want good Miyazaki film, pass on this one. If you want great animation, buy "Dumbo" or "Pinocchio". And if you want great films, buy any of the classics like the four movies mentioned before or "King Kong", "Godzilla" or any of the other top 100 films listed by the American Film Institute. "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder", so don't let the myopic vision of reviewers blind you to a bad movie choice made by people who really don't get out much. PS Used "Nausicaa" for sale or trade 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 This book is full of assumptions and generalizations. Some information is distorted. According to the logic of the writer over 90% of the population should be already dead from "addiction". The writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful. It is possible, but the writer doesn't make any notes about the  men and women centered systems. The only system that is good is the female system 
 Modern creation theories are proving that an infinite God is the origination of our finite universe.  The consequence is that there is no celestial world.  Instead, God empowers and enlightens our world directly through a holistic spiritual atomic system.  Some of these atoms are human mind/souls.  Since the creation only contains wholes, mind/souls-bodies relations are never lost, making reincarnation a natural process.  So, channelling and paranormal sources must be questioned. 
 Being deaf and diehard baseball fan hurts me very much because that DVD is nice in images but didn't have any closed captions (cc). I'm feeling discriminated. If you are deaf or know some deaf people, don't buy or give that DVD for gift 
 I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book "The Sigma Protocol". It says "In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy." Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter "ordinary man" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. "The Aquitaine Progression" might make a half decent TV movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much 
 Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a secret service agent who is guarding the President of the United States. He is assassinated on Cuba's watch. Of course, he's consumed with guilt. A Pulitzer Prize winning reporter is trying to uncover what really happened and gets Cuba involved.  Sounds like it should be fascinating, doesn't it? It was dreadfully boring. Don't waste your time on this dud.  
 I ordered this once, the order got cancelled, and I hurriedly ordered it again, so eager was I to read it based on what I'd heard. What I'd heard was wrong. In addition to rambling on about himself and/or nothing, Armstrong offers only warmed-over advice from other published books on writing. That's right, he's done no original research with any primary sources whatsoever. He takes lots of advice from King's _On Writing_ (making sure also to tell us in detail about King's van accident and how the driver was found dead the following year...and what does this have to do with advice on how not to write a novel?) and plenty of mildly relevant personal experiences, such as joining the Crime Writers' Association (though he didn't have much time to devote to it because he'd just started a new romantic relationship, you see). The advice he offers isn't bad (with one exception), but you could easily cut out the middleman by buying this advice in its original packaging rather than Amrstrong's dull recycling.  The exception to the good advice is the repeatd mantra: Don't do it. Don't be a writer. Just don't do it, you'll regret it, and so on. This would have been clever once or twice, but he does it over and over and over again. Excuse me, but if I weren't serious about writing I probably wouldn't have bought your f*cking book, now, would I? As if a single book is going to talk me--or anybody else--out of it.   This is minor compared to the other flaws the book contains, but Armstrong and/or his editor have absolutely no idea how to punctuate. He sprinkles commas, liberally, throughout, to the point where, they make no sense and, slow down, or stop your comprehension. This leads as well to some truly leviathan sentences--I counted no fewer than 9 clauses in one of them. Sheesh 
 The boys at GSAM clearly wrote this book as an "alternative" to Grinold and Kahn and to help promote the group as the seek to raise assets.   Grinold and Kahn work at Barclays Global Investors, GSAM's biggest competitor, and they wrote a first-rate book on how to do quantitative management. Their book has become the standard, the must read, and is required by the CFA exam. This obviously bugged them to no end. It's no fun to see your biggest competitor getting tons of accolades. So they did what anyone with a big ego does: they wrote their own book, this book.  Only problem is this book STINKS. What's the matter with it you ask? It has no content. The boys at GSAM were so scared about divigulging anything that could help a competitor (or the market) that they didn't really want to SAY anything.   Now how do you not say anything but still write a book, you ask? Excellent question! The answer is you talk in infuriatingly broad generalities about very general topics.  For example, on the topic of how do you actually trade the portfolio, they come up with such gems of wisdom as:   "Tradomg is the process of executing the orders derived in the portfolio constrution step. To trade a list of stocks efficiently, investors must balance opportunity costs and execution price against market impact costs." [page 431]  This knowledge anyone who has ever thought for 2 seconds about trading knows. The real value might come if they gave you some cool way to think about measuring opportunity costs, ex-ante. Or a nice way of estimating market impact costs. Do they do either? Of course not! Just more and more banal talk.   The book is filled with millions of other examples. One should use a decay weight in estimating covariance matrices. How should we choose that decay weight is of course never mentioned or discussed!   They tell us when choosing between factors to predict returns, "the real challenge is to winnow down the list of factors to a parsimonious set." Okay, how might I do that you GSAM gods? They never ever tell you [see page 420]  You get the point, just lots of blather and really no content.  Save your money and don't buy this book. They don't need your money they have enough already. And it's not like you are getting knowledge or anything valuable in return 
 This is by far the most stupidest book ever written. I think most reviewers have already said what there is to say. This book is about HATRED and nothing more. I also read the author's review on the "Journey Of Man" here in Amazon, where he said 99.5% of all the arts and music came from Europe. As a historian I can only laugh at this statement! - Asian countries like India & China were the cultural centres of the world. India is the bithplace of language and music. It is from India where Europe learned that it is a good idea to have a bath more than once a year!! This man surely knows nothing about history and this book proves he knows nothing about science either!  All human beings were black once. Our color differences come from adapting to various climates. And if this man hates black people, he is not a human being!!!!        
 I LOVE LOVE LOVED The Boy Next Door and Boy Meets Girl and was totally pumped for a new Meggin Cabot novel.  Every Boy's Got One was flat out awful.  I couldn't even bear to finish it.  I still love Meggin Cabot but this book was a giant disappointment 
 No earth shattering or interesting receipes here.  You can find most of the party ideas online 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 This is the worst book I've ever waisted money on. I'll be sure to go to the library or local bookstore from now on to check out, anything that he writes, for myself. After reading his book about the best 150 perrenials, I thought this might be a winner. Then someone rated this book with 5 stars. No Way! Talk about Rube Goldberg. The first item he mentions is an INDOOR composter. Even the new Organic Gardening magazine is in the 21st century. If I didn't have to pay for postage I'd send this book back. I'll donate it to the library for the next book sale 
 I enjoyed the parts regarding the S.S. Valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. Except for Picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. We never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. The whole "adversarial" situation with the 1st Officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for Picard 
 I have waited years for this album to be released on CD, but listening to it this week has been a big disappointment.  Rather than digitalizing this from the master tapes, this CD was quite obviously made straight from vinyl - complete with hisses, pops, etc.  Especially poor toward the end (ruining one of the finest recordings of Icarus with McCandless at his best).  I really expected more and suspect the members of Oregon had very little to do with this release.  C'mon folks, yank this off the shelf and give us the real recording.  I still have my vinyl version of this and it is easier to listen to. 
 A lover's betrayal. . . A killer on the loose. . .   Eve Duncan was actually happy. She had a man who loved her, an adoptive daughter as great as her own, and her dead daughter's bones were found and safely buried. But then a letter in the mail opens her eyes to a secret her boyfriend, Joe Quinn, kept for two full years. Now she wants away from him, and when a job opportunity in a different state presents itself, she packs her bags and leaves. On her first night in Louisiana, someone tries to kill her, and they won't give up until she's dead! Will she uncover the secret in time? Or will death silence her?  When I picked up this book I wasn't surprised it got high on every bestsellers list. It was moving a mile a minute and between the hired assassins, secrets, deaths, and conspiracies, I knew I was reading a great novel. And then, after chapter 5, the book came to a stop and decided to creep at turtle speed. The character of Eve Duncan became uncharacteristically naive and immature, while her 12 year old adoptive daughter Jane was acting like a 50 year old, smart and mature beyond her years. The book dragged all until chapter 12. Once chapter 12 begins, the book takes flight once again and the bombs (literally) start going off. The ending was good and though I thought it was predictable, it was still somewhat enjoyable. It wasn't as good as the first two books in that series, but it was better then the third. 
 The Scientific Method applied to this book:  1) Form a hypothesis:  Great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment:  Interview 80,000 managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw conclusions: Write this Book.  With the exception of the "12 questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  They make several insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes."  However, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  Did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  Did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount.  The entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.    It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  However, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  If Buckingham and Coffman didn't claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind," I would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.   
 Typical of the war movies of that age.  Very much the Americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice.  I enjoyed looking at an America that was.  Would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life 
 This book is poorly written, disgustingly inappropriate, and crass.  The characters are rude to each other.  It references periods, maxi pads, virgins, groupies... it clearly shows the problems in today's society including lack of respect for each other, lack of dignity, forget grace, that's long gone...  Do anything with your money other than buying this book. 
 This film is based on a concept that has potential - a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things - but it doesn't deliver.  Clearly, the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us, but he pretty much drops the ball right there.  Usually with this sort of plot, you are at least given the illusion that *someone* knows the answer and what's more has some clue about what to do with it as well.  There's no such suspension of disbelief in this one, nor even an attempt at such.    Adding injury (if you count eye strain) to insult, the whole thing is shot in grainy B&W with annoying MTV-style jump cuts.  In the awards for Obnoxious Splash Films of the Year, this one takes the cake, but not the Pi 
 The book reads like a gripping novel. Unfortunately, the evidence the author uses is pretty much innuendo, hearsay, and rumor. Having been a student there, his comments are exaggerated. Yes, there are some problems about the curriculum and professors who deem themselves self-important, but I doubt this problem is only at Harvard. This book capitalizes on the desire in America to see the  top stumble once in a while 
 Birch once again gives us more information about herself than is needed.  Check out Donna Farhi's "Yoga: Mind, Body and Spirit" for a more thorough examination of the subject matter without all of the self-important jibber-jabber 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 The sole market segment this book MAY assist are people who have never moved.  The points made are so obvious that it could have been written by your next door neighbor, not an "insider."  The only "insider" aspect to this paperweight is that someone on the inside saw a market opportunity to cash in on a segment of the moving population with a catchy title and nice cover graphics.  The "ABCs" of relocating, as PART I is described, offers about a couple of paragraphs on MAJOR topics ranging from "Negotiating a Profitable Home Sale" to "Insurance, Finance and Estate Guidelines".....hardly subjects that can even be skimmed in a few paragraphs.  Not that I would expect a treatis, but to suggest in the index that such subjects are addressed, is nearly misreprestation.  In sum, if you read the index, you have read the book, because the information which follows, to be generous, touches on each  subject 
 of stupidity! smoke on the water have the most stupid guitar rif of the rock history, boring boring boring, but if you like it ok 
 Man, oh man, I think this is one of the worst books I've ever read.  If I could give The Thanatos Syndrome negative stars, I would!  Seriously, half way through, I came to Amazon to see how bad other people thought it was.  Boy was I shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive!  I found the book bizarre, unfocused and poorly written.  The volcabulary repeatedly seems misused.  The plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that US funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation.  The physics, engineering, psychology, medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic.  Characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome, only to have them dissipate.  And so on.  The characters don't even seem like real people.  For example, the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain, and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are.  How could someone know a person that well, but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood?  Or:  one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them.  C'mon, if the guys a nut (and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck' to them is nuts!), write him as a nut the whole way through, don't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book's climax!  The book's title isn't even explained, for crying out loud.  Thanatos means death in Greek, I believe, but I could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying.  I won't read this one again, nor will I look for anything else by Percy Walker.  
 I highly recommend this item as a study in rhetoric and denial of science.  Mr. Bethell was recently on Book TV discussing his book and was truly entertaining 
 It's hard not to love the idea of this book, just as it is easy to hate marred execution. A fascinating botch job, but still a botch.  As seems to be the case with the authors of many social histories, Kuh is so enamored with the fact that he got to this idea first--and it is a "why-didn't-I-think-of-that? one--that he inserts his story into the mix; in this case, he'd like to see a parallel to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist--but he ain't Joyce, and clearly isn't much of a cook. He's a great hypocrite, however: I found it hilarious that a guy critiquing culinary elitism continuously throws out french dishes without translating or providing an explanation of the dish. You will be amazed at how little discussion of food there is in here.  I won't dwell on the grammatical errors or preening prose--other reviews have--but I will say that the most dishearterning aspect of the book is the author's inability to get over himself, which severely limits his coverage. Clearly, he's not good enough of a writer or thinker to understand his own bias--because he fetishizes the past; makes his time in the kitchen (60s and 70s) to be the most important era in food history (of course!); and then tries to act like a distant, objective journalist for the present, treating it like clinical, lifeless business. This supposed distance kills the book's intent: instead of tracing the evolution of the American restaurant, he ends up lionizing the past and trashing the last twenty years of professional cooking, which get few pages and absolutely no discussion about the food produced. It's remarkable, given all that has transpired in the last 15 years, that he spends no energy on the fact that America is the culinary center of the world, yet can come back to talk about Henri Soule again and again.  The book you're looking for has not been written yet 
 I read this whole book. And once I was done, I still was left wondering, what now. It really hasn't done anything for me.. 
 I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  All the reviews both here and in the literature that came with the disk are positively glowing.  However, although well performed, to my uneducated ear this just sounds like  "random music."  It's the muscial equivalent of abstract art.   For me, it was a waste of money 
 I'm a huge Suz fan ... but I really think she missed the boat on this one.  Her style has changed since she moved to hardcover & this book just fell flat for me.  The secondary storyline or FBI agent Jules was much more enjoyable than the lead couple Cosmo & Jane.  Didn't like her at all & Cosmo lost his "Seal-ness" somewhere along the way.  Not a re-read for me 
 That should have been the title of the book. I was really disappointed. There was very little about Grace O'Mally, and more about what she did on her vacation.  I really didn't care why she changed her name or where she stayed or that she got sick and couldn't go row-boating. I just wanted to know about women's roles at sea, which she did cover a bit, but she could have done in a 100 page paperback instead 
 I was expecting this collection to be as funny and engaging as Nobody's Perfect.  While the collection does have some highlights, notably Woody Allen and Steve Martin, a good bit of the book is more enjoyable as a historical observation on highbrow humor throughout the great magazine's long run.  One of the fun parts about the book is trying to figure out when each piece was written, as you're reading it.  That's one of the FUN parts.  Hoo Hoo Hoo 
 Living near McCarter Theater in Princeton my AP English class got to go see a production of this play while it was still being work-shopped for Broadway. Afterwards, my teacher asked what we all thought, of course first stating that she loved it so that all of the "favorite" students knew which opinion to take. They all raised their hands and said they loved it to, however, no one could say why.  Why not?  Because everyone hated it. I was the first to open the flood gate. "I thought it was ridiculous.  It has no real substance to the plot." "That's because the language is the point" "Well the language is the worst part.  Why would poor factory workers speak in absurdly flowery metaphors?  Especially ones that stupid ('Does the bicicle miss the boy?')?" My teacher flipped out at this. "You don't understand!  That's what literature is all about!  Metaphors!" The woman, asides from being a gigantic b**ch, was merely blinded by what reviews had told her to think and by her crush on Jimmy Smitts. A month later, the New York Times, reviewed the play after its Broadway premiere.  They said pretty much exactly what I thought.  I was going to bring the review into class, but why bother?  The woman already hated me.  PS. One earlier reviewer discussed how it was impossible to determine from the production the the daughter was raped.  During a Q&A afterwards, Emily Mann stated that they were having problems deciding how to show this.  I agree with the reviewer that they clearly didn't come to a good solution 
 The Adorama Silica Gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it. I emailed customer service at Adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond. I can't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready. What color should it be and what color should indicate recharging. How to I recharge it? Nothing tells me how to recharge it. So far, money wasted. Unresponsive to my emails 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised!  To date, I've been denied twice.  The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode!  I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted."  Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.  The product itself is average.  I've used better and worse.  That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price 
  If you wish to own a book produced with the customary competence of HBS Press, nice paper and all, this book is certainly worth it. If you wish to purchase a book that provides some information about the history of economics then too it is worth it. But if you are looking for what the author pretends this book to be then you would be sorely disappointed.  The key theme of this book is that there is a new field of Complexity Economics, the preserve of the Santa Fe Institute, which is so revolutionary that it would lead mankind to truly, finally understand the Origins of Wealth. Well, in the excitement that that promise held, I actually ended up reading the whole tome. It helped me recall and recollect some tried and true ideas of economics, a refresher course of sorts, but left me with an aweful, disappointing feeling as well.  First, and foremost, the author simply lacks the intellect to cover and comprehend the complexity he is attempting to simplify for us. He can hardly hold the attention of the reader on a single page, on a single theory, let alone do so across conflicting ideas, or across the whole 500 pages. Many of his understandings are so superlous that he misses the essence of some of the key economists of history. His quotes are always unknown and irrelevant ones, and one is left to think why he chose them, not so many more relevant and applicable ones.  Second, the phrase complexity economics may be new but the idea that economics is complex or interdependent or organic is as old as the field itself. Behaviorial economics has already won a Nobel Prize, and investor irrationality two more, which prizes are awarded decades after the original contribution. Even John Keynes had written extensively about investor rationality decades ago.  Third, one is constantly fed the party line of the Santa Fe Institute, which is part pop-culture, part academic, part baloney and part intellectual theft. That the author is a McKinsey advisor does help one commisurate as a reader with the poor effort, after all their hot air is best left for short reports not full books.  Fourth, most importantly, the book takes off the title from Charles Darwin's Origin of Species. Oops. There is no attempt to address why economics is an organic field, or how that theory of complexity about a living system has any relevance whatsoever. Here the book is not even a history book for it is stunningly unfamiliar with the literature on the subject. There is a mention here or there but which leaves one thinking of what he has missed, not what he has covered. The area claimed by complexity economics has been covered by so many fields and so many writers, that even old Nobel laureates like Herbert Simon were hardly revolutionary.  Fifth, the second half of the book just collapses into garbled garbage. There are chapters about finance and the random walk hypothesis, leaving one to wonder what the author is even selling and why. Is the economy so complex as to be a random walk, which the author rejects (explicitly), or is the complexity by design, which too the author rejects (implicitly). Recall the early part of the book where the author says it is by design but there is no designer. OK? and what has that got to do with complexity economics, or behavioral economics or random walk theories.  Sixth, the book is no more than the scrapbook of an overly hyperactive but terribly undertrained mind. Nothing captures this book better than the scene in which top scientists and top economists are brought together (by John Reed of Citibank I think, or else why is he mentioned so much in a book about economics). The author talks the usual mumbo jumbo, even citing scientists ridiculing economists. Well complexity economics rests on all the slippery slopes that traditional economics does. One cannot get out of that conumdrum by living within it.  Seventh, any author that cites John Reed of Citibank has no idea what he is talking about. John was a technologist and an engineer who revolutionized Citibanks back office, and blew it three times. He does not in any sense have any understanding of any financial system, other than as a manager of a company in which his tasks to the end were technological or personnel. Also any author that cites Malthus again and again should be condemned to the same failure as Malthus was. What Edsel was to the auto industry, Malthus (and this author, if he was any good) are to economics.    Finally, no economist can ever escape the limitations of economics without conceding that finance or economics are like medicine (not chemistry) and law (not laws of physics). They are in their nature inherently practical pursuits, not science in any sense. Just like the sideeffects of a particular medicine can never be predicted for every individual, ever, economics can never predict perfectly. Every great economist, including Adam Smith, Von Mises, Keynes and Milton Friedman have been moral philosophers, who wrote books on social, political and philosophical issues in their spare time. Each thus understood how small an area they truly knew. So the hope of the author of leading humanity to some new threshold of revolution is a trumpet that has been sounded since the dawn of economics, and will alas, be trumpeted again and again by the economist turned seer turned consultant turned author.  RANDOM HOUSE WAS RIGHT TO DUMP THE AUTHOR, FOR THE AMAZON RECORDS SHOW IT WAS THE ORIGINAL PUBLISHER WHO ANNOUNCED THE BOOK, ALHOUGH HBS PRESS WALKS ON WATER TOO. WRONG CHOICE THIS TIME THOUGH.      
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 Maybe my expectaions were too high. It's hard to beat an album like Dr. Octagynocologist and Dr. Doom. This album has sick beats and 50% of the songs are about urinating on people. Check out the Deltron 3030 and skip this one 
 Though well written.  Mr Strobel's 'Case for Christ' cannot be logically concluded since all of his sources come either from the Bible itself, which indirectly Strobel is also making a case for, and people who are unabashedly Christian.  It is like attempting to prove the existence of god by saying that the bible says he exists.  Then when questioned on the validity of the bible we say it is valid because it is the word of god.  Strobel tries to make a case by stating biblical sources when in essence that is the very thing he is trying to make a case for.  Including other secular non-christian sources that provided validity for his claims would have helped his case tremendously.  As it was it didn't prove anything to me other than Mr. Strobel is a believer.  Good for him. 
 I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts 
 This is a profoundly dishonest book, not only on the subject of Joan of Arc, as seems to have been covered in detail by another review, but also on other topics in which a similar lack of research - and therefore a lack of detailed knowledge - has produced speculation and outright invention. It is  another case in which an author gathers a few convenient half-truths and  spins them into a story that suits their purpose while ignoring the  objective evidence. Unfortunately, such sloppy intellectual habits have  become all too common 
 Richard Bach is the most inspiring writer alive. Or he just was the most inspiring one? The alternative explanation to much of the disappointment that seems to be common to Bach fans after reading his latest book, is a very humane one - not eveything that one does could be a master-piece. If this was his first book, I would say he was a promising author. But after books and books of wonder-ideas, this can at best invoke sympathy for the Richard struggling to reestablish the lost connection with Tink.  At its beginnig, Out of my MInd suggests that the story will elaborate on the factory of ideas story from One (my personal favorite; both the book and this particular episode). However, it appeared that Bach was not able to elaborate on this or any ohter idea.  I am still hopeful the real Richard Bach will be back. However, reading Out of my Mind, the thought of Leslie kept coming back. Bach had an almost spiritual connection to his fans. We believed him, as you believe a teacher and a leader. I still believe in parallel present times, but do not have the courage to reread The Bridge Across Forever. Out of my Mind did not convince me that Bach himself believes in his ideas any more. Leslie is not just just a divorce case... Two stars just because everyone has the right for error 
 While not entirely lacking in emotional resonance, this book is definitely a drop in quality from Donaldson's science fiction and fantasy. I got the impression that he tosses these mysteries off, for fun and without much attention to detail, between writing the books he really cares about. It's not that it's entirely unworthwhile, but mostly the characters resonate only in two dimensions, and come off as insanely obtuse. The plot is so simplistic as to be laughable. You'll have it figured out by Chapter Two. This can be a fun, quick read nevertheless, but don't expect the grace, dignity, and care that Donaldson generously lavishes on his sci-fi/fantasy works. 
 I'll have to second Mr. Harding's comments. There are some good songs on here, but the singing isn't the finest I've ever heard in the gospel realm and the musicianship is competent but not overwhelming. The live recording also tends to make the piano sound distant at times in the mix.  I can only imagine people like this because of the feeling they get from the sheer enthusiasm of those involved. You definitely do pick up on the "Spirit" for lack of a better term when these punchy numbers hit an acappella break and the soloist is testifyin' over the choir's loud clapping.  Note: This release adds three bonus tracks to the original 1960 lineup. "Restore Unto Me (The Joy of Thy Salvation)","The Lord's Prayer" and "The Lord Will Make a Way (Somehow)" are the additional tracks. (I can't say any of them are outstanding, however.)  HIGHLIGHTS: "Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody" gets over on its spitfire call and response between soloists Calvin White and Margaret Sampson and the choir at large. White shines on "Sweet Jesus", a lovely ballad that goes into near orbit during a sumptuous acappella break.   LOWS: "He Stays in my Room" is PAINFUL to listen to thanks to a dissonant vocal. Faytha Drayton sounds fairly nasal on her solo in "You Can't me Doubt Him". Bessie Lewis seems to struggle to maintain the key in "He is Such an Understanding God".   BOTTOM LINE: If you're a gospel devotee, you'll probably like this well enough. If you, like me, listen to Christian music but you're selective about WHO you listen to, you may not find this compelling enough to want a copy for your collection. 
 Book Review The Slaves Shall Serve - Meditations on Liberty James Wasserman (2004)  When I bought this book, I had hopes that I had come to the end of a long search for a book that combined a genuine understanding of both politics and the occult.  That sense of hope mainly hinged on the fact that Wasserman is a Thelemite, one of the few modern esoteric traditions which I consider not fluffy.  Unfortunately, what I found was yet another magician who seems to have spent so long on the astral plane that he has been able to develop only the most superficial understanding of the social-political realm.  Wasserman has seen the smokescreen of liberal ideology for what it is... only to trade it for the most common and silly ideas put out by conservatives.  For example, while condemning the "liberal" notion of gun control, he states that he thinks Senator McCarthy was right, and believes than an invasion of blue-helmeted U.N. troopers is imminent.  One of the most amusing claims he makes is one parroted by right-wing talk-show host almost daily: that there is a leftist bias in mainstream media.  As evidence, he points out a Media Research Center report that found a 10-to-1 ration of "anti-gun" to "pro-gun" stories on major news channels between 7/1/97 and 6/30/99.  Well and good, but if the media is really so left-biased, then why did the same research organization find a *100-to-1* ratio of pro-war to anti-war stories in the months leading up to Gulf War II, at a time when the most conservative polls showed over half of all Americans opposing the war?  And if the media is so leftist, why do right-wing pundits like Newt Gingrinch and Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson all have their own talk shows while leading Left intellectuals like anarchist Noam Chomsky and socialist Howard Zinn find themselves confined to poorly-compensated tours between universities?   The gun-control essay is, in fact, the best-written and best-researched essay in the entire book.  There is another decent essay about Waco, but the documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagement, which Wasserman references, does a better job of laying out the horrors that the U.S. government carried out there.  The others I find to be rather groundless opinion papers with few convincing arguments to back them up.  The book is further weakened by the fact that these essays comprise a little under half of the book - the second half is a reprinting of the U.S. and U.N. Constitutions with some minor notes and observations tacked on.  The book sells for $20, a rather steep price for about 100 pages of original writing, especially for such superficial analysis.  I'm sure Mr. Wasserman really does cherish the idea of freedom, but I'm not sure he entirely understands it.  He condemns both collectivism and democracy!  "Would you really want the post office to run the world?" he asks, to which the True Libertarian (i.e. Anarchist, from whom the so-called libertarian party mis-appropriated the term) responds with a resounding Yes!  The post office is a perfect example of how a non-centralized federation of autonomous communities could function.  There is no central high command for the post office, but if you put a letter to Prague in a mailbox in San Francisco, it will get there.  Wasserman also defends the idea of a republic, saying that true democracy is like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.  Well, that goes to show that you can prove anything by allegory.  If we inject a little realism into this allegory, we can see how quickly it disintigrates though.  First of all, nowhere in nature will you find two wolves for every sheep.  Common sense tells you that this is impossible.  And even if wolves did outnumber sheep, it has been shown that even these fierce predators practice- not survival of the fittest!- but mutual aid, that other important anarchist principle.  If a member of the pack is sick or injured, the pack doesn't abandon it, but shares food to try and keep it alive.  The individualism which Wasserman so often invokes sounds to me more like egoism, which, unless I am mistaken, is the enemy in Thelema.  Perhaps that is why he feels the need to justify his worldview with a divine power as the basis for morality.  His position just doesn't hold up on its own.  The fact is, the whole liberal/conservative split is itself just a smokescreen put up to hide the true agenda of those in power, the heads of the multinational corporations whose GDPs are larger than those of almost every country in the world, and whose transactions in fact make up a large percentage of the GDP of the world's superpowers.  Both "liberal" and "conservative" presidents have obediently carried out the secretive and undemocratic World Trade Organization's program of "neoliberal" economic reforms.  NAFTA, for example, was dreamed up by Reaganites, refined under Bush Sr., put into action by Clinton, and then further expanded under Bush Jr.  More than the U.N. coming to take away your guns, Mr. Wasserman, you should be concerned about the WTO coming to take away your food, your water, and your livelihood through programs which no bullet can damage 
 This book offers no real practical advice for reader to "survive" in crazy and dysfunctional workplace. Furthermore, the writing of this book is way too PHD-alike to tie to its "light-hearted" title. I stopped reading it after 20 pages or less 
 I found this to be a collection of superficial soundbites. If a person is a fan of the major players they might enjoy seeing the interplay between them but for me this documentary is a bore 
 Long story short: this is a spectacularly pretentious book that says precious little about Caravaggio or his art.   90% of the book is the kind of vapid talk, talk, talk that has meaning only to the kind of phony "artists" who populate our cities and museums with ugliness and nonsense. Though a very few pieces are shown to "quote" from Carvaggio, most have nothing to do with his art. So why are they discussed in this book? Is this book nothing more than a marketing gimmick for lousy artists?  There's the artist who copies a small section of Caravggio's "Christ and Saint Thomas," and below it displays a square filled with red Jello. OK, at least the "work" has something do with the great master. But how about the installation that consists of 7 benches that have leaky red gelatin atop them in the place of cushions? And where do Andre Seranno's morgue photos or his "P*ss Christ" fit in -- except perhaps to shock the reader?  This book is a complete load of nonsense. But it *is* expensive. Do avoid this if you are looking for a serious look at more than a handful of Caravaggio's works, accompanied by a sensible discussion of his craft and subjects 
 And I still can't find those little aliens :)  Really, there is no conspiracy.  And there certainly ain't no extraterrestrial life.  The only mysteries of Ancient Egypt is why current Egypt is still so backwards 
 This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time 
 dear readers I have not read any of these books before this one, but I have seen the movies. Odviously I loved them, so I wanted to read the series. When I bought this one I thought "o.k., mostly Marty and Clark." But when I started reading the first page my attention went elseware. THIS BOOK IS SO BORING THAT I DONT THINK THAT I CAN BARE TO FINNISH IT! No offence to the author, but I suppose that I, a teenager, am to young to appreciate the dull reminecences, the unimaginative dialog, and all of the deep southern accents. I am only on page 40 and I am looking for another book to read. So my advice to anyone looking for any action or plot in a book, is to pass this one up and see the movie (cringes as she says it, because she never says it)! I picked up this book thinking that it was a non-cheesy not dscriptive romance novel. But she spends eight times the time thinking and talking about herself than thinking and talking to Clark. I might have enjoyed this seiries if I had read about younger characters.  
 I love cozies and am very fond of the Miss Julia series.  I had to lower my rating of this book because there is a 98 page reminiscence in the middle of it that provides nothing new to the loyal reader of this series. That's about 1/3 of the book. Very disappointing. 
 Once again, Iron Maiden offers over and over again the same songs they always play. This is noting new. This is nothing interesting. That band just shows no respect for the fans because they offer the same stuff in order to make money. The same tracks live for the 1000000000000 time. If you are a fan, show some respect for yourself and do not buy this. Make the band know they have more songs to offer 
 My 5 year old bought this toy with his birthday money.  The figures are great and the weapon and dragon are awesome, however, the ship will not stay together.  Every time my son plays with it, we have to rebuild it, making it not so much fun for any of us.  It probably is fine for an older child who can fix the ship on their own, but if you have a younger child you may want to pass on this one 
 I finally figured out how to manipulate the remote and menu to get the film to play without the commentary.  Very good after you master this.  I would now rate it as a 5. Mark Wagstaf 
 I loved every Elizabeth Peters book I had ever read until this one. She is one of my favorite authors and I am a huge King Arthur fan. My expectations were high. The book was horrible. The plot was loose and the writing was like a bad romance novel. The only good parts were the descriptions of the towns and sights in the Enlgish countryside. From the copywrite this must be one of Ms. Peters early books. She should be ashamed to leave it in print. This is the only book that I ever bought that was so disapointing that it made me angry that I had spent money on it.  (For some reason following this review it says it is for the audio version of th book only.  I have never listened to the audio version.  This is referencing the actual written book. 
 Ummm.... Why should I pay 20 dollars for this when it comes free in a 5 dollar comic book 
 I cannot say I enjoyed this book, largely because the main character, Joseph Reaveley, seemed to me to be self-absorbed and oddly moralistic in his approach to the horrors of war and the challenge of defending what often seems entirely indefensible. For example, there is the rotten war correspondent who forces (though heaven knows why) a courtmartial of a poor wounded soldier who may or may not have deliberately maimed himself to get out of the trenches and tunnels he was wounded in. It is never quite clear why in the face of no evidence of self-mutilation this fellow is courtmartialed and possibly (we never know) likely to be hung. It is, apparently, because, morality and honor require this??? Then, when this same correspondent turns up dead (with everyone thinking it couldn't have happened to a nicer fellow)- Saint Chaplain Reavely takes it upon himself to find out if he was murdered and if so, by whom. This, in the midst of trench warfare, poison gas - and then the idiocy of Gallipoli - where Joseph appears to confront another war correspondent who thinks the stupidity of that battle should be reported. Oh no, says our Joseph who is horrified that anyone in England should know of this - and tries to stop him - risking his own death (how incredibly brave) as well as that of another poor wounded fellow who, of course, is ready and willing  to die, because Joseph knows best. Then, of course, there is Joseph's moral outrage at his sister who is chastely yearning for a General, and his "courageous" decision to ruin his best friend's life because doing so is "the morally defensible and right thing to do" despite the fact that Joe knows what his friend did was necessary to save England from the truth of the horrors of war. Really?  This was the most disappointing of this series. Joe's previous moralizing was a bit much - but tolerable. This one was way over the top and thoroughly unbelievable 
 A useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between countries.  However, it is not worth the price.  It is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students.  It is more suitable for general second year accounting students.  Plus, as I am working with a multinational European bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date.  There is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries 
 untrustworthy is the term that comes to mind to describe this piece of literature and its author.  There really isn't anything "human" about the "change " galpin advocates in reality.  In fact after hearing the man speak, one can only get the "whats in it for me" philosophy.  Secrecy, abandonment of ethics and morals comes to mind when   reviewing the work and the man.  Deeply disappointed 
 I was very disappointed in the content of this book. I was expecting meat and only got a strip of bacon. I already knew all the fluff stated in the book. I was looking for How to set up vendor relationships?, How can I "hold" a suit for my client to 'try on' without having to make a purchase for a couple of days while my client makes a decision? Instead I read 20 of the same statements over and over again (I got the feeling they needed to meet a page quota). Bottom-line: If you are really "green" and don't expect executable information, this book is for you. If you already have your office established and have a couple of clients, but no idea how to set up vendor relationships and what/how to charge, then I suggest you learn by trial and error, then write your own book...I will.  But please, put some meat in it 
 I read (or tried to read) the first six or seven stories in this book and wondered - these are the best horror and fantasy stories??  I was bored to tears by each of them, by authors who seem to have no idea how to inspire wonder in the mind of the reader.  As a writer of such genre fiction myself, I am offended and appalled that these stories were published anywhere, let alone selected for a best of anthology.  Ellen Datlow shows me time and time again that she knows nothing about editing fiction.  Bring back Robert Silverberg, Jack Vance, Sam Delany, Roger Zelasny, Fritz Leiber .... 
 Richard Haass attempts to distinguish himself from the neocons. Aside from form, however, the substance really isn't any different. Both begin with the assumption that American Imperium is a requirement for peace and prosperity and any real deviation means *global* catastrophe. Any suggestion that American Imperium itself is the problem is simply beyond the pale, and is dismissed by all sides of american foreign policy elite (neocons and neorealists) as "unserious" or worse. Neocons and neorealists are 2 sides of the same coin. The "argument" between them is kabuki theater. A pointless handwringing melodrama, signifying little and meaning even less. At their core, both are motivated by a proconsul's view of the world where the only future of humanity worth living is one where america's elite, and the children of america's elite, are the one's calling the shots.   It's not a view shared by the rest of the world 
 This metal detector is nice, notwithstanding, it performs poorly when in all metal mode.  Initially all metal mode works fine, however, after half an hour of use the batteries begin to wear out and the battery low indicator does not come on.  When all metal mode is used after half an hour of the detector's use, it just squeals uncontrollably.  It's supposed to go off over metal and pin point the source of your initial find with great accuracy.  Again, after thirty minutes of use of the detector, it will no longer go off over the source, it will just go off constantly, no mater where you hold it.  I could hold it into the air and it still squeals.  I made every adjustment I could and it just continues to make noise.  This mode is worthless unless your using it with two fresh 9 volt batteries every half an hour.  Finally, if you're hunting say meteorites for four hours, you can expect to spend over $56.00 on batteries for that afternoon 
 I've seen better books that offer help in this area, but for the price I paid, it was still worth it.  My kids can use it to gain some insight.  It is very easy reading, too 
 The first movie was full of hammy and snobbish acting. Perhaps it was the point of the first movie to just be rude and awkward because the plot of this movie is that a boy bets his step sister that he can sleep with the new girl on campus. This is not an original plotline, but the added twist is that if the boy sleeps with this new girl, as part of the bet the step sister will give herself to her step-brother. Take that for what its worth. There was a good crop of rookie actors in the first movie, but then the second movie is not worth it at all. It was a B movie... which is why it went straight to video. If your a frustrated teen boy, you will love this movie for its sexual content. Otherwise, it is greatly overacted and over dramatic 
 Historically inaccurate, as has been mentioned before.  Before you see the movie search online for Artemisia's work.  If the director, in her movie had shown the very powerful piece "Susannah and the Elders" her theory of Artemisia's romance with Tassi would have been ripped to shreds.  Only a woman suffering from circumstance and a cruel injustice could've depicted scenes with such passion.  In the painting Susannah's face and posture show such despair and hopelessness.  Also, Judith and Holofernes (sp?), it doesn't take a genius to see the violence there.  For Heaven's sake, she's sawing his head off, no quick slice there!  Judith's face is one of grim determination.  Plus only a female director who submits passively to domestic abuse and lacks self esteem or vision can make a rape into a gentle love affair(yes, I am saying I think the director needs counseling).  Plus the movie never mentions the fact that Tassi attempted to have his wife killed on five different occasions.  See this great woman's work, don't buy the movie 
 Coming after the "Back to the Future" movie trilogy, with its perfectly placed conundrums and insanely ingenious plot twists, and after Stephen Fry's capricious "Making History," another good, fully thought-out  alternative history, this Gore Vidal opus rather pales in comparison.   Vidal tackles Big Physics, but gets immediately lazy and is unable and/or  unwilling to flesh out the math and the scientific concepts.  So we're left  with a hodge-podge of famous characters, past presidents mostly, who behave  arbitrarily and a plot that turns arbitrarily.  What's the point?  I don't  know - "life's a silly game" maybe?  This could have been an excellent book  to give to your teenage son (if for no other reason than that it shows a  kid doing something other than staring dumbly at his computer) but the  graphic sex is probably something most parents wouldn't feel comfortable  passing on to their "impressionable" offspring 
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 I grew up reading Johnathon Livingston Seagull over and over, and became a fan of Richard Bach after reading a few of his other books later in life, but with One it seems he's become too comfortable in his role as an always-inspiring and thought-provoking author, and didn't strain himself to be either.  The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions.  Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it.  Very mushy and soft throughout, and occasionally even preachy and self-righteous.  I'd recommend one of his earlier books over this 
 The problem begins with the categorization of this book.  The back cover says that the book is fiction, yet the author repeatedly states that this is a true story in the prologue, epilogue, and everywhere in between.  After this, the problems of the international bestselling author become even more dramatic.  Setting himself as the main character, Coelho sets on a journey to find his angel.  Making contact with an angel in itself is not a radical concept for a plot.  However, equating Christianity to sorcery is downright blasphemous.  The elaborate ceremonies described for summoning angels are in no way related to Christian doctrine.  To contact his angel, Coelho seeks a motorcycle gang in the Mojave Desert called the Valkyries.  It is possible that a motorcycle gang could be spiritually gifted.  However, the idea that the Valkyries sleep with men to make money for their missionary work is appalling.  Coelho lost my respect in this book the minute he suggested "the beast" was present on the cover of The Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonley Hearts Club Band".  How much more hokey and unoriginal could an author be in stealing an idea.  While I enjoyed "The Alchemist", I felt betrayed after reading this book.  A once promising author has lost his direction and now pedals weird concepts that resemble cults. 
 Actually, I wish Amazon would allow for two ratings ... one for the movie itself, and one for the DVD.  Fantastic movie, horrendous DVD transfer by DreamWorks.  As has been stated by everyone here, the way DreamWorks has handled this movie is shameful and beyond disappointing.    Do NOT buy this DVD ... it simply is not worth parting with your hard earned cash.  Either rent it or find a away to watch the newly released Australian or UK releases (~March 2006) which have DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 English voice-over tracks 
 While this is a very high quality edition of the story of Pinocchio, I decided to return the book.  Why?  Because chapter 15 is entitled "Pinocchio is hanged" and includes an illustration of Pinocchio hanging by his neck from a tree with his hands tied behind his back.  Although this may be true to the story of Pinocchio, I didn't feel that a book containing an illustration such as this is suitable for young children 
 I really wanted to like this book.  I know that Holly as a character is written to be rather superficial. She's dazzled by big names and celebrity, whether it's Julia Child or famous dog trainers, fashionable street addresses, educational and dog institutions,  brand named dog food or titled pooches.  All have gotten her gushing approbation, and for the most part, her naive enthusiasm has been a fun ride.    The flip side is that she just as strongly sounds out against anything she doesn't like: cheap addresses and clothing, poor hygiene and personal habits, garish jewelry and stereotypical characterizations have all gotten a lot of page time. Most of the books in the series seem to rise or fall on a maniac/depressive line.  When Holly (or Susan?) is up, she gushes about what she loves (dogs usually, or whatever) the carping asides are minimal and the books are interesting and fun.   When she's down, the characters are drawn harshly and critically, Holly dwells on unpleasant details, asides and negative or even prejudiced descriptions and the book is not fun.   This book is not a happy one. Holly starts off the book being critical of her mother, surprisingly since formerly she always spoke of her in glowing terms.  But now she blames Marissa for posthumously causing her ring nerves, and for being a "hypercompetent martinet". I admit I got tired of Holly complaining in past books about her father, who seemed generally good hearted, and whose pull with the AKC she never hesitated to draw on when needed,  but was so embarrasing to her in other ways that she tried to avoid him the rest of the time. I was hoping after her marriage to Steve she'd reconcile more with Buck, grow up a little. Instead it seems she's now started after Marissa. Not that we couldn't read through the lines about that relationship in previous books, but at least Holly always spoke well of her. So that started off the book with a disappointing jolt.  Virtually every newly introduced character after that unauspicious start is dysfunctional as well, even the featured dog. And while praise of her own dogs usually adds amusement and uplift, there's very little of them in this book.  Instead Holly spends a lot of her time at "home" when she used to obsess over her dogs (or her email), instead obsessing over one of her many other pet peeves, weight, in the person of an overweight houseguest, describing how she throws out much of her own food, cooks green beens, and counts every bite the character eats. She actually uses the word  "disfigured" to describe her. Her own dogs come into it when one gorges on the guest's secret foodstash.  The other new characters are given the same unloving detail, with something dysfunctional brought up with all of them.  Without spoiling the plots to describe this, when *every* new character is introduced in a negative way, there's something wrong.  I'd hoped that Holly's obsession into negativity in the latter part of the series was due to her disappointment over Steve's marriage to another, or her previous head injury, or something related to a series plot that now that she was married to Steve or recovered from her concussion, the character's former likability would return.  I.e., a plot point. It would be hard to keep reading her otherwise. But instead of marriage soothing Holly's lapse into crabbiness, and swinging her mood up, the author seems now to be using Steve for more of the same critical asides.  Steve delivers a long lecture to the houseguest that sounds more like Holly "channeled" instead of his formerly mild mannered self.   People read series cozy mysteries for entertainment, and often for character development. Holly's character started out a bit strange, but often fun, and usually likeable.  Even the murderers at times had a redeeming quality or two.  But now Holly just isn't likeable, and even the non murderers are drawn harshly. She seems to see characters now always negatively, often stereotypically and sometimes in a downright prejudiced light that seems out of base with supposedly liberal Cambridge.  She has everything she could want, (except perhaps a bigger yard) but she continually finds faults to dwell on, to obsess over. If she's angry at her mother for being a "hypercritical martinet" she needs to stop channeling that critical nature in her own fictional life.  Or the author should stop channeling it in her books.   Carping isn't a very admirable quality in any character,  much less being entertaining.  A whole book of it without relief is not a pleasant or fun read.  I know this author has written good books, and I hope she gets over her funk and writes them again. This series deserves better,  as do the readers. But this book was not one of them.  
 Let me count the ways this thing let me down:  1. You have to open it to slide out the full keyboard, making it vulnerable to damage  2. It doesn't matter whether you open the case or not. If it drops, the case falls right open anyway, spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protect the 8525 from.  3. The case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it.  4. The case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something, and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged (at least that's what happened to me).  Super disappointed in this product, in case you couldn't tell 
 I love all of The Berenstein Bear books. I've been reading them since I've been a kid. I'm now 20 years old and I still read the books. But this one offends me. I love Jan & Stan Berenstain, but why did they have to bring 'God' into the series? I am an atheist, and hearing/reading the word 'God' makes me sick! I'm sick of people being obsessed with all these mythical gods and stuck up in religion! I crave the day that religion and the belief in gods is completely destroyed from people's minds. Bringing 'God' into my favorite children's book series is an absolute disgrace 
 This should be the real title.  How many people does George have to screw over before the world wakes up and realizes that this guy is just one big rat 
 The vast majority of the book has no relation to the title.  There are great passages, but they are largely buried under dozens of pages of yammering prelude, silly bickering, and attempts at drunken humor.  James Morrow's Blameless in Abaddon covers the same theme with much greater depth and breadth 
 This is the old version.  Seek out .MAC with iWeb Second Edition instead if you have a newer MA 
 Perhaps I was taken in by the 5-star average review of this book when I bot it, or seduced by the reviewer who claimed even a raw beginner could profit by reading it. I should have been more cautious when one reviewer said that it was not for the timid or faint of heart.   I have read some popularizing books on this subject and even taken a course for non-physicists in the subject of particle physics. I found the book unreadable for several reasons. Professor t'Hooft undertook by himself to translate this book from its Dutch original into English; it is clear that his upbringing in the excellent Dutch school system allowed him too early to specialize in the sciences at the expense of language study. Even though the book's English was vetted by Robin Mize, in many places--averaging once per page--the English expression is nearly unintelligible. A difficult subject whose mathematical elegance is apparent to the baptized but admittedly difficult to convey in language for tyros is here often beyond hope of being understood.  The first 11 chapters, wherein the author presents a history of the subject with its brilliant breakthroughs and sometimes insurmountable problems, are readable. But once the author himself, then a graduate student seeking a thesis topic, enters the history and the account becomes personal, the book ceases to be intelligible. Sadly, this is the very selling point of the book: "This is a first-hand account . . ." The cover reviewers from Nature and Physics World are enthusiastic, but then they are scientists. "Sharp statements" and "novel formulations" are not the stuff that open doors for novices in search of broad avenues of understanding. And the "dry ingenious humor" of the author was quite lost on this reader who was struggling to parse the English with Dutch syntax. Sorry  
 Difficult to set up! Netting rips far too easily... Avoid this item! Be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough 
 This is one of the worst books written in the field. The author barely shows how he came to any mathamatical answers in the book. His theories and math also have many holes in them and therefore they should not be trusted. Honestly the author of the book should go back to college to learn how to write in a scientific manner and learn basic stats 
 Hey, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Yoshimi, but this is just atrocious. Maybe I just don't get it, but I don't want to have to "get" random sounds with Wayne screeching in the foregound.

 Although there are new nutritional ideas, the average person interested in a balanced diet will find this difficult to follow.  Recipes are boring 
 What happened?  Her previous book, "The Last Life," was terrific.  The two short novels in this [price] book (big type, too) are awful.  They read like five-finger exercises at a third-rate MFA program -- all characterization, no action or development.  Omit, but buy The Last Life -- it's great.  Hope the author's next will return to her previous level of excellence 
 This work is said to be plagarism--see Scandals and Scoundrels: Seven Cases That Shook the Academy by Ron Robi 
 I felt that the writer tried too hard to be hip, cool and funny and because of this, it was difficult to read this book.  I found myself searching for the next "excruciatingly contrived hip, cool phrase"; thereby I wasn't concentrating on the storyline 
 This book is from 1987, I briefly read the reviews saying that it wasn't in the digital era, OK I figured that's fine, how out of date could it be? However, I didn't expect that so much of the book would be dedicated to functionality that's now fully automatic, such as TTL Flash, and TTL exposure metering.   It's certainly a very interesting technical read, that provided me with an understanding of all the different macro options, lenses, filters, extensions, TC's, reversing rings, bellows, reverse mount adapters, lens stacking, etc. However, it wasn't for me.   I was after something that would show technique, or provide advice on how/where to find the shots he was taking, but the book doesn't cover that at all, to my dismay the book starts with the author writing "it always surprises me that folks find it hard to find subjects" but then provides no advice. After having bought a 60mm Micro lens I was hopeful this would provide direction, but other than "I probably should have bought the 105mm lens" I didn't get any direction from it.   
 After reading all these reviews, I bought the book thinking I was buying THE infertility book must-have. It's OK. Not great, not bad, but not what the hype here led me to believe. I'll keep it in the library, but I'll be more careful about buying based on reviews here 
 The author is reusing a similar plot device than in "Twisted":  a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes. The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.  A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish:  ("favilla", "favillitos"). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional. In sum, a book carelessly executed 
 The premise of this book is: what would have happened to the history of the world if the Roman Empire had never fallen? Giving Robert Silverberg the benefit of the doubt: rewriting the entire history of the world is a difficult thing to do. However, because of that most people wouldn't try it.  The book would have been better as a collection of short stories. Each chapter is a story in itself, and then history normally jumps 300 years and all the characters who were in the last chapter are, clearly, dead. Another annoying thing about this method is that each chapter he has one of the characters recap the entire history of the Roman Empire, including all the chapters that you just finished reading.  Silverberg is also pretty inconsistent in certain things. First, he tries to Romanize all the place names in the beginning to the point that sometimes you don't know where he's talking about. But then on the next page he mentions the German boarder. Not only that, but when they discover the New World (a.k.a., Nova Roma) they come across Mexico and Peru. Also, later in the book he talks about how "Londin and Parisi" were major cities. I'm not that up on Roman history, but were those really the names of those cities during the Roman Empire?  There's also a bunch of historical inconsistencies. He wants to rewrite history as if the Roman Empire never fell, but yet there is still a "medieval" period (complete with knighthood) and a Renaissance. The Renaissance doesn't make sense because if there was no real "Dark Ages," how can they have a Renaissance? However, if I recall correctly, the whole concept of knighthood was part of the feudal system that arose as a form of organization once the Roman Empire fell. WWI and WWII also happen around the same times, but under the names of the First and Second Wars of Reunificantion. However, he's also somewhat inconsistent about what these wars refer to, having the Second War of Reunification refer first to subduing fights in the outer provinces and in the next chapter having it refer to the founding of the Second Republic. He's also inconsistent in the numbering of Emperors. For example, all of a sudden he has Trajan VII who is from Hispania and yet somehow even though it's special enough to mention that he's from Hispania, his name is still the same as six other Emperors before him, also you cannot seem to figure out when these people ever ruled. Not to mention my annoyance at the fact that the languages in Europe develop in exactly the same way that they did, which I'm not entirely sure would have happened if the Roman Empire hadn't fallen.  A big part of my annoyance comes from his treatment of the Hebrews. First of all, Silverberg is clearly of the belief that the Roman Empire fell because of the Christians. So how can he make Christianity not start in the first place? Well, clearly by having the Exodus fail and the Hebrews remain slaves in Egypt. Of course something that I realized toward the end of the book is that he refers to the Hebrews having followed the Law. If they never left Egypt, how did they get this Law? Not only that but I found it offensice that he portrays the Hebrews as being greedy and miserly with their money. He says that the Hebrews have a "knack for finance" (87) and one of the Hebrew characters in the first chapter is the only one "who kept the strings of his purse drawn tight" (28) while others are giving money to street entertainers. That stereotype arose in the Middle Ages because the Church restricted Jews to being moneylenders. However, (a) that's after the point in the story that the book starts at and (b) the stereotype would not have have been created if the the Roman Empire hadn't fallen. Yet Silverberg treats that stereotype as truth, and I find that offensive 
 Peter Segal's "Anger Management" is a film with nothing going for it.  It is best described as boring, annoying, and devoid of laughs.  Mild-mannered Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding.  He immediately develops a problematic relationship with Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), the self-help expert leading the sessions.  As the two men spend more and more time together, Buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling.     "Anger Management" just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like.  It is essentially a one-joke film that wears out its welcome very quickly.  Sandler and Nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker.  Furthermore, the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings.  Truth be told, "Anger Management" is one of those projects that was green-lighted because of the talent involved and not because of its quality.  
 The first three books in the saga of Kay Scarpetta were readable, even good.  The character was sympathetic, as were most of those who were involved with her.  However, the stories and the characters quickly sank into self-pity, whining, and self-absorption to the point that they fast became unpleasant at best.  After some time, this reader decided to give Cornwell one more try, picking up Blowfly off the bargain table with much hope.  That hope was too soon dashed to small pieces.  First, the readers have not been dealt a fair hand in the matter of Benton Wesley, the man Scarpetta loved and who died a horrible death in an earlier novel.  Pete Marino, the detective Scarpetta worked with in Richmond, is even more irascible and surly than ever before.  And Lucy, Scarpetta's niece, now heading some sort of investigative/para-police group, is whiny and vicious.  Worst of all, though, for a professional, she makes one of the stupidest mistakes in the very beginning of this story that a person in her field could make.  Readers have to wonder how she has survived this long.  Having discovered all of this in the first third of the book made me reluctant to go on.  Then the setup for the "big problem" was so heavy-handed, that I stopped.  All of the elements that made me quit reading this series in the first place were present in this book in spades.  Where were the editors in this bit of work 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 This book constantly asks reader to jump back and forth between chapters.  It failed to present a general picture of financial accounting. The author  did not organize his ideas well. Do not choose to read this book if you are  new to accounting 
 My elderly mother watches him and recommended that I get his book, thinking it would be of some help to me in this day and age of rising gas prices, the growing gap between rich and poor, the expensive and increasing costs of health care, etc., etc. I never heard of him, but it seemed like it would be a useful book. Well, this book was not helpful to me in any way. He seems to be focused on his own agenda in many areas and not on real, regular people. When he does offer insight or advice it is very simplistic, generic and obvious, for example - just "forgive yourself". He doesn't have anything original or interesting to say, he's not clued in to REAL issues affecting every day people, and he doesn't offer anything in the book that is even remotely helpful. This book was very disappointing. I ended up returning the book and got my money back 
 I usually cook everything from scratch and don't mind spending a few hours making several appetizers. BUT, to make just one  recipe in this book, you'd need to spend a couple of hours. The majority of the recipes are too fussy and complicated and just not worth the trouble. I made a couple of the crepe appetizers with different fillings. They were the least time-consuming but the result still wasn't worth the effort - no one took seconds 
 I am one of the Vietnam veterans referred to on page 217, the ones that didn't agree with anything the VVAW had to say.Someone wrote in their revue " the myth of civilian disrespect to the soldiers during this period of time", I would have to say it felt quite real to me. The only reason I checked this book out of my local library was to confirm a couple of things about John Kerry and the VVAW. All my questions were answered either by the book or by a recent interview with Gerald Nicosia. The first was that the other members of VVAW felt that John Kerry was just using the organization to gain public notoriety to help him with his political career. The second was that he was at the november 1971 meeting. This is when the anti war VVAW considered assassination of pro war Senators. Simply amazing 
 A true Christian teacher teaches the principles of the Holy Bible -- both the good and the bad.  False teachers teach only what people want to hear.  Yancey is like a false teacher.  He doesn't want to teach anything that makes people uncomfortable -- such as the Holy God of the Bible ordered King Saul to annihilate all the Amalekits -- women, children, disabled included!  This is our God!  The God of the Bible we worship.  If anyone has problem with the genocidal God of the Bible whom we worship as our God, then he can go to Hell.  He will go to Hell because he doesn't believe in the God of the Bible who ordered King Saul to kill women, children, and the disabled 
 I purchased this for my 11 year old son.  I am so thankful that I read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it.  The pictures are hand drawn but graphic.  Far too much detail for the target audience. Kids need to know about sexuality but they don't need to know EVERYTHING before they are even teen-agers.  I would be upset to find this in a school library.  This book definitely needs to be used with supervision. I returned this book as I believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of 10 years old. 
 So I saw this one live action Alice in Wonderland movie and it sucked!!!! But I'm confused this isn't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie, I think it is. I'm not sure if I want to risk boring myself with other crap... so will I watch this verison ever... who knows 
 Una interpretacin absolutamente falaz tanto de la historia como de la filosofa poltica. Un sinsentido que lamentablemente ha tenido enorme repercusin en la formulacin de polticas desde el imperio hacia la "periferia". Un deseo de teleologa desde la imposicin del poder. En fin, hay que leerlo slo para rerse un rato con tanto absurdo. 
 I read this book and I can't figure out what Banks was trying to say. I was thoughouly confused for days wondering what was going on. I would love for someone to tell me what it was that I read, becasue I certainly don't know 
 As a historian of the IWW, I bought this title hoping for something new and insightful.  While the presentation is new, it really suggests what Henry Adams referred to as the devolution of America.  The real IWW did some interesting things with the graphic arts -- none of which are cited or displayed by the author.  While portrayed as a serious history, this is truly a comic book posing as history.  I would not buy it again 
 The Taunton Press has published some excellent books - I especially like "Built-Ins". But this books seems to have been thrown together with little thought or integrity. Featured are numerous pictures that can been seen in their other books; this recycling of images is an affront to the reader - I never forget a photograph, and feel ripped-off when I recognize it from a different book. The Taunton Press should re-think its strategy; re-hashing previous publications and slapping on a new title is lazy, unoriginal, and insulting to its readership 
 Heavy machine, looked durable, almost commercial. Put her together and began. Within 5 MINUTES of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated! Returned it the following day and bought a Bissel that has worked great, was cheaper and weighs less! 
 I must have a funny bone missing or something. This trite little book was a big yawn from start to finish. The only thing I can say in its favour is that, living and working in France as I do, it will be a little easier to explain some of the peculiarities of the English language to the natives 
 While I applaud the author's stated intention of injecting personal insight and empathy into a discipline that has long been characterized by often falsely objective posturing, this collection left me highly  dissatisfied. The effect of her essays was to make anthropology just  another of the many contemporary genres that inflate "personal  experience," rendering it melodramatic and marketable. If I were more  interested in the individual doing the telling, perhaps the book would be  more compelling, and I found myself reading on in the hope that at some  point the author would succeed in making herself an interesting subject.  Unfortunately, the finale left me with the suspicion that she is not a  particularly good writer, though she may be a very good academic, one who  sells books to boot 
 Please, it is exagerated to think this book is a classic, such a opinion is too restrict and reflects a readers too simple meaning of life 
 What a lazy and poorly written book for a writer who has been so thrilling in his previous novels.  I cared so little for the "good guys" that the "evil" medical examiner was not fearful.  The head of the mob and his henchman seemed far worse - torturing, etc.    It should come as no surprise that not all readers are going to root for Frank, the boring mob lawyer and his self righteous daughter who are defending characters that are uninteresting.  I never was made to feel anxious on their behalf.  Breach, the poorly dressed, sadistic mob boss acts like Amanda is his god-daughter or something.  There is something very wrong with that.  I don't care if his henchman, Prochaska, is wrongfully convicted anyway.  For Frank and Amanda to be worth rooting for you need a truly hideous "bad guy" as was the case in Wild Justice.  On their own, they are not intersting or vulnerable enough to make us worry about their cases especially with such uninteresting clients 
 Luckily, I didn't buy it. A friend, who is also a fellow raw foodist, loaned it to me. After two weeks of pain from this book, I gave it back. The mac and cheese was disgusting and I won't waste my breath on the rest of the book.  I have to agree with another reviewer. I've seen Brian posting fake reviews about his book to "up" the sales. Unfortunately, his grammar and writing style is apparent when you read the reviews. Almost always they have misspelled words, run on sentences and poor structure.   Problem is that his book suffered the same fate. This is an example of another person, like Frederic Patenaude, trying to write a book that really hasn't taken the time to taste and experiment. He sees this as an opportunity to cash in by self marketing his own book.   Sorry, but if you pay more than $3.00 for this book including s&h then it's too much 
 I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom.   The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?   This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it.  I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published! 
 Basic connectivity and wireless work. Any attempt to use advanced firewall rules fail including VPN passthrough.  This device could not have gone through even a rudamentory test cycle.  Please read the reviews, this is common and these problem were confirmed by my IT dept and also by D-Link's tech's as well.  On second one, all of the exact same problems.  Sad to have made a choice, hope they make it right 
 I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.  I could not finish it.  I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it.  So I traded it in at a local used book store.  I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress.  The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody.  I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book.  And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.    I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book.  It was very disappointing 
 many of the other reviewers have captured the problems that this book suffers from. It is a crazy www of poor design and problematic realisation. This is not information design. spend the time you would have wasted  reading, thinking quietly. I have read contextual design which thinks  through integrating design with users and it is much more provokin 
 I'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot. It's redundant and unnecessary, and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent. Only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself. Double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that's based on and well...  My gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it's original format onto DVD was bad. The soundtrack is about 1/2 to 1 second off from the video part of film, therefore the voices don't sync up with the lip movement. 
 Unfocused, repetitive, and worst of all - boring!  What should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame.  Ronnie Earle, the district attorney at the center of the film, says,  "This isn't about Democrats and Republicans, this is about cops and robbers." If only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say. Instead, from the start, The Big Buy feels like a film you've walked into thirty minutes late. Following the theme stated by Earle of cops and robbers, The Big Buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic, but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely won't notice. Somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story, to bad it's not being told here.  
 Once again, National Geographic and some producers have gotten together to make a movie. There is so much B-roll of birds, coyotes, bats and whatever else in this flick that if you took it all out the movie itself would be about 50 minutes. Also, since part of this movie takes place in the jungle, there's plenty of unga bunga in junga tribes dancing and running around. You can tell the B-roll really did come from some sort of National Geographic-esque type production house because whenever they use it, there's a lot more grain than the rest of the movie. Now, the movie itself has a horrible dialog and the voice over work doesn't help either. The way the movie flows from scene to scene is absolutley ridiculous too. Whoever planned out the scenes must have been a schizo. Some of the zombies look really good, but the majority of them look like someone just put grey paint on their face. Decent gore, but that's about it 
 Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the "Dracula" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la "Dracula 2000." That alone should tell you my expectations.  But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or people at a Halloween spook house.  However, one good thing about this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are included on the DVD, it earns 1 star 
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot 
 I bought this after seeing Mark Morton of Lamb of God reference these guys and Duane Dennison as worth a listen. What I heard was bad production, shoddy vocals, generic guitar, and overall dullness. Steer clear of this is you like good music 
 When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem. 
 I SUBMITTED MY REVIEW TWICE! WHY IS IT NOT BEING PUBLISHED? PLEASE REPLY  
 "Casablanca" is my favorite movie of all time.  I felt extremely happy when I heard that an original soundtrack of Max Steiner's great score was to be released.  However, my illusions became shattered when I bought  this CD because almost all the dialogue from the movie was included on this  Rhino release.  I felt so disappointed at that.  It would be better to buy  the movie instead 
 I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse. It arrived and I immediately saw a defect,in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly, even with major force. I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them. I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me. Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter's organization but without any success. I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and, in particular, the after sales service.

 Watch out for the volume leveling mentioned in another review. Surely the compliers could have come up with a better sort order than by composer. The change in tempo/volume between pieces makes it impossible to enjoy. My two CD's ended up in the trash.  Ke 
 Neither even the stellar acting of the great actors William Defoe and Christopher Walkin, nor the nearly continual gratuitous sex that permeates throughout, could save this boring film nor its weak plot. The sex scenes, which are numerous and ordinarily include several women at once, were actually well done though peculiarly uninteresting.  Walkin and Defoe are on their game, and nearly make it a worthwhile viewing, but the script writer and the director were both asleep at the wheel.  As a science fiction film, it contains nothing interesting either. The story is boring, and plods through irrelevant scenes. I had high hopes for this film; thinking it was similar to 'Blade Runner' and possibly half as good. After watching the first few minutes, I was minded of 'Liquid Sky'.  However, it wasn't even half as good as 'Liquid Sky', and that is not a great film either, but at least it held the viewers interest.  I wouldn't suggest purchase of this film to anyone who hadn't seen it first, and then only if they didn't fall asleep 
 For those of you who love Jack Kirby....Skip this one.  It takes his classic New Gods and deprives the reader of the colorful atmosphere and mood that made the series so special.  Did DC think that new readers would purchase this in black and white?  That color would be too expensive?  I cannot imagine why the suits at DC decided to publish Kirby's work in this format. Wait for the color version 
 Another Catherine Breillart examination of a weird-ass French chick.  I have a hunch that is a description of the writer/director herself.  At any rate, the real interest became a guessing game as to what inanimate object the heroine would insert in herself next.  A trying and boring distillation of everything that is absurd and exasperating with introspective, obsessive intellectualism. The young lady is lovely, and I hope she found better material for herself in her later career.  Whenever I am exposed to one of these extravaganzas of repulsive people doing shocking things, I always think of Elliot Gould as the photographer in Little Murders, who is embraced and lionized by the intelligencia when he starts photographing dog poo on the streets of New York.  And why not?  Isn't it nature?  Doesn't it symbolize and comment on the way we live? Yeah, right. Have fun.  
 the fact that Woodward was a briefer to Alexander Haig when Woodward was serving in the Navy. Tons of documents have come out disproving the allegations of Bernstein and Woodward in All the President's Men and Final Days. The authors downplay the relationship between Haig and Woodward dramatically, hiding the fact that Haig was Deep Throat. Look at this logically: why would a high up guy in the executive branch named "Deep Throat" come out of nowhere to reveal what he knew about Watergate? Deep Throat MUST have had a previous relationship with Woodward, and the only man with a connection to Woodward who knew so much about Watergate was Alexander Haig. Why isn't this mentioned in ANY of the Woodward/Bernstein books 
 i'm a student & my age is 20 
 While the concept of this film is entirely interesting to viewers in search of enlightenment especially when it regards birth, death and transition, it sadly fails in quality.  Eliot Jay Rosen hosts this badly filmed documentary in an attempt to show how a soul arrives, leaves and spends one's time on earth. The concept is fascinating and essential to someone on their death bed in my opinion. But the script is haphazard at best with glimpses into the life of a few people dying of cancer, and others who have had life after death experiences. But unfortunately I felt some of the interviewees seemed rather spooky and cultish in their descriptions. Because of this anyone not open to the concept of enlightenment will probably be completely turned off to the idea if they watch this film. For anyone versed on the ideas expressed within this film it is basic at best and just sort of an overview of the theory. The quality of the film is really horrible as if done by amateurs so I found myself being distracted by the film rather than the notion.   Rent it.....the purchase isn't worth the experience. 
 This product is not eligible for free shipping, yet it ships from the Amazon warehouse along with the humidifier that IS eligible for free shipping 
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 apparently none of you have sensitive skin, because if you did, you would understand that all those receipes that include the use of alcohol would murder your skin!  especially the one for problem skin, my face hurt just  reading it!  i would also like to add that, for what you would need to put  on your skin to kill the bacteria that grew there from all the spoiling  FOOD you just had on your skin...it's not worth it. i was quite  disappointed with this book, except for the incredibly well known use of  cucumber...all you're going to do is damage your skin, upset it's natural  balance or give yourself an infection. it sounds really nice, but there are  tons of alcohol free, safe herbal products out there that would do a lot  better for you 
 I must disagree with the others who gave this book a poor review. I do believe the book is not exploiting fear. It is depcting the truth of a horrible subject and those who downplay this are in some denial. Unfortunalty, how the book conveys this is sub par. It focuses mainly on the offender's mind and the type of horrible crimes offenders commit, but it is often redundant. It briefly departs from its overly dramatized narratives to cover types of offenders, but for the most part I found myself having to hunt for information. Many passages in the book read like a novel with the author trying to play up the drama of the situation which will be almost like culture shock to nayoen used to reading typical psychology books on this subject. It has a lot of filler, I think, and is certainly not a concise information packed book.  The book does drive home one very important thing, though- sex offenders can be anyone- your neighbor, your friend, your pastor and that is the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 
 The very title for the book - "I Con" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young & William L. Simon. I could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs.  What is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems 'personal'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill. And the facts aren't well-strung together either!  From the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a "reformed" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!  If you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy 
 "Dark Tort" was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read, but for a novel that's supposed to be part of a quirky, light mystery series, I found things a bit leaden.  The book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered, and when we finally do move beyond that scene, a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further.    I do admit that it also doesn't help that I'm one of those people who can't suspend disbelief and have to ask, "...so she's an off-site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified?"  But, that's just me.  Oh, well... many of the recipes did sound good, though I doubt I'll get around to making any of them.  This is one of those reviews where it's probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series (which I personally haven't read but suspect aren't much different than this one), you'll likely enjoy this installment, too.  The rest of us can just wait for the latest Robert B. Parker "Spenser" novel for our light mystery fix.    
 Huge problems with the LCD screen, two cameras within one month after purchase showed the LCD "shattered." One has already been shipped for service and the other one will be going in tomorrow.  Sure it is easy to use and produces great pictures, but the LCD problem is a definite negative. 
 I didn't like the way she skipped around in the next chapter 
 Does not keep beverage warm for a long enough time. Construction is cheap and does not deserve the price. 
 I bought these as a birthday present to myself to replace a set of well-used Monsoons which finally bit the dust. I'm not a gamer or an audiophile so I thought these were just fine for what I wanted--decent sounding, small enough to fit on my desk, and a name brand. And they were all that--for a month. I used them before bed one night and the next afternoon I went to use them and there was nothing but a loud buzzing coming out of the left speaker. I fiddled with all the cables and connections. Nothing but buzz. I turned everything off & on, still nothing but buzz. The right speaker seemed to work just fine. In frustration, I turned off everything til the next day. Fired it all back up and the buzz was still there. Thankfully, I had kept the receipt and packing material and returned it within the 30 day time limit. I had the opportunity to upgrade them for the newer Bose Companion set and I chose to go with a Logitech system with small speakers and a subwoofer I can hide under my desk.  In the month I'd had these Bose, I'd decided that I was really still a kid at heart and I missed the thumpa thumpa of my Monsoon subwoofer. I never got that from the Companion system 
 This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!!  Totally out of date! Useless!! Wondering why it is still for sale.  The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one...  Outrageaous!  Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back 
 While reading this book, I had the feeling that the author was making his observations from the perspective of an overgrown teenager, home from school around 3 pm and making puerile rants at the (...) tube, while downing a coke and potato chips. The author, who has said elsewhere that TV has become "our ground of being," borrowing Paul Tillich's phrase, doesn't seem to acknowledge or understand that most American adults work hard for a living and really don't invest a lot of mental effort in watching TV.  They're actually busy with making dinner, dealing with their kids, paying the bills, downing a couple of cool ones, and getting up in the morning to do it over again.  This is not to disparage the hard working American, but rather to suggest that most people really don't take TV all that seriously, or even pay it much attention.  Just because the TV is on, doesn't mean people are watching it, or at least watching it critically.  They have more basic needs to attend to. From 1980 to 2002, the time on the job (any job) has increased by about ten hours a week. I don't think information or pseudo information gets through to a culture that is so sleep-deprived.  (...)  Additionally, Gitlin takes his subject matter entirely too seriously. I mean understanding media was pretty much covered by McLuhan, and, just as A. Whitehead said that all philosophy was a footnote to Plato, one could say the same for McLuhan in relationship to his progenitors. Additionally, Gitlin's perspective's really couldn't be that profound since he seems to be called upon by the media as the academic in residence for news shows.  I think it may be time for some producers to cull their rolodexes (or is that palm pilots?) I started this book, believing I would be at least somewhat intellectually challenged, but in the end, the sentences sort of just rolled over me like a syndicated drama series rerun 
 For those already aware of Buddhist or New Age principles, this book might serve as a pleasant reinforcement. If you seek a deeper truth, you'll be disappointed by the cooing stories of the author's grandmother. The ideas, like accepting what is and living in the moment, are sound in my experience, but the presentation strikes me as infantile. A luxurious use of ink and space make for an attractive book, suitable for a coffee table or waiting room 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 I have purchased a total of three of these collar. They seem to work great for a while then they they need the dog to bark louder and more often to get them to activate. Then, after a few months, they quit working altogether. I check the charge and the batteries and that's not the problem. I don't think they are for large outdoor dogs 
 I am a student of Ayurvedic medicine and particularly passionate about Ayurvedic nutrition.  I just wanted to point out to all readers and potential readers of this book that Ayurveda does NOT support the eating of raw foods as the majority of your diet.  It encourages all constitutions to eat a majority of cooked food, because it is easier to digest and helps to support healthy agni (digestive fire).  Ayurveda is also a very strong supporter of drinking cows milk, providing it is organic, unhomogenised, and appropriately prepared (cooked with spices).  In fact, drinking milk is one of the keys to health and happiness in Ayurveda - milk is the one food that directly nourishes shukra dhatu (reproductive tissue) and therefore directly nourishes the immune system.  Ghee (clarified butter) is also a very important food in Ayurveda. Ayurveda only supports vegan diets for certain constitutions or conditions, usually for limited amounts of time. Ayurveda also supports the eating of meat in certain conditions and by some constitutions, providing again that it is appropriately prepared.  If you really want to improve your diet and ensure it is appropriate for your prakruti (constitution) and vikriti (current imbalances), go and visit your local Ayurvedic practitioner!     
 Most of the material found in this book can be obtained from your state university extension or on the web, often times in greater detail.  Although reasonably priced, this reference contains only surface level information 
 This is another of those books for me that was very "middle of the road".  It was not terrible and it was not great.  It was a bit slow for my tastes and the characters were very ordinary.  
 If you are using a computer with a recent version of windows 95, or  windows 98, the code in this book won't work, so don't buy it.  Frankly,  the publishers should have pulled it off the shelves by now 
 I have to wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers...to be fair the multiplication information that *is* contained in this book are useful and some of the pictures using the chocolate bar can help students. However, the art references by far overshadow the math lesson and as I was reading it, I found myself distracted and confused...and I'm an adult!  The hershey's fractions book is much better than this one. I thought I'd get the set and now I'm glad I didn't--this one is worth skipping over 
 The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history. The books is misleading in that regard 
 	I have found this book very difficult to enjoy.  To begin with, the first chapter is spent telling me that I can do it!  The writing is condescending and achieves the opposite of the intended motivation.  The cartoons are stupid and not comical. While reading you'll quickly learn that the author offers a service to you, the aspiring inventor.  Reese, as your partner, will take your idea, help you develop it, package and pitch it, and negotiate the contract.  In exchange you split the royalties with him.  This sounded like a great idea to me: Your idea combined with his knowledge and skills could produce great results.  It's a win/win.  So I looked into his website.  For him to consider your idea, you must pay a 175-dollar fee.  The concept is that this fee is nominal compared to typical lawyer fees.  Its object is to prove that you are serious and so that Reese is not swamped with ideas.   The real payday for Reese is when you get paid too with royalties for licensing your idea.    I am a college student and cannot afford to swing 175-dollars so easily, so I requested that he waive the fee and hear my idea.  I assured him I was serious and that I believed my idea had great potential.  After all, the big money is in the royalties, not the 175-dollar initial fee.  Reese declined the offer.  He said that it would be poor business practice to offer different prices to different people. I am very objective, and I am not offended that Reese declined my offer.  But, to address Reese's inability to modify prices, consider that car dealers negotiate prices, department stores have sales, and of course, Amazon will sell you this book for less than your local bookstore.  I quote Reese from page 68, "While we're on the subject of fees, if the price quoted is more than you can afford, it's quite appropriate to ask if the attorney can come down a bit."         Reese unintentionally enlightened me to the nature of his operation.  The 175 dollars is so important for a very good reason.  The 175-dollar fee may seem nominal compared to the fees of a lawyer, but Reese is dealing with many more clients than a lawyer.  One thousand ideas submitted is worth $175,000.   I know that if you're reading this review you have an idea, you don't know what to do with it, and you can't afford to spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer to find out.  Reese knows this too.  This is perfect marketing.    I'm not suggesting that Reese doesn't do what he claims.  I'm sure he takes ideas and markets them and makes money for himself and the inventors.  However, I question what percentage of submitted ideas he acts on.  If he was successful with a significant percentage, it may have been lucrative for him to at least hear my idea.  The message Reese sent is clear:  The 175-dollars is more relevant than the potential of the idea.              I give this book two stars because I commend Reese for his clever approach at earning a buck.  I feel he is unethical, and he condemns most of his own practices in this book.  However, when it comes down to the bottom line, Reese isn't breaking any laws, and he's trying just like you and me for that million-dollar payday.    
 I thought this book was going to be a wonderful improvement on an 800 year old ideal, modernizing it to fit a less hostile and disgusting world. I was wrong. If you're against republicans and war, this book will infuriate you like it has done to me. Don't pick it up if your morals are not Christian conservative, do yourself a favor and find another mentor. I'd recommend anything by Gandhi or the Dalai Lama.   I give this book two stars only because the author presents his viewpoint well enough to be useful to those that agree with him. The rest of us were at a loss picking up this book 
 The cigarettes have no taste.  Many people in the work place go out for a smoke break.  I bought the candy  cigarettes so the non-smokers could go out for a break also - the cigarettes have no taste at all 
 70% of contents are sponsored, and ads appear everywhere making the whole thing hard to read. Most importantly, instructions are not understandable 
 I love this turban. It enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head. It's lightweight and extremely absorbant. I have been using one for more than 5 years. I'll never go back to usung a regular towel for my hair 
 This book was intelligently written -- too intelligently. In fact, I found it unintelligible the first time through. After reading Ake, I was looking forward to reading Soyinka's lectures. To my disappointment, they weren't  lectures. They were sermons delivered to a room full of PhDs. If you  already know a good deal about Africa and are not afraid to have to read a  book two or three times, then this book has some interesting ideas 
 There are much better books on management out there than this collection of unorganized work.  Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques.  If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment.  This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.  Spend your time elsewhere. 
 If you're an insecure enough parent that you need Michael Bradley to tell you the whole family problem is that just that "your teen is crazy" so that you can evade facing your own issues, this book is for you. I worked with children, teens, and parents for 10 years (directly in their homes on a daily basis; not, like Bradley, by seeing them in my office once in a while), and I can tell you there are a lot more crazy grownups out there than crazy teens. In fact, teenagers get along with their parents a lot better than parents get along with EACH OTHER (proof: our 60% divorce rate). Last year, California law enforcement offices responded to nearly 200,000 domestic violence cases, the vast majority involving adults over age 30.   If Bradley can't summon empathy for the several hundred thousand children and youths who are confirmed as violently or sexually abused by the parents every year, the several million who live with alcoholic or addicted parents, and the tens of millions who suffer severe family conflicts before and after their parents' separation and divorce, he needs to get out of his comfortable office, toss his arrogant theories in the trash, and take a hard look at the real world.  I looked up the terrifying teen statistics Bradley presents, and EVERY ONE OF THEM IS OUTRAGEOUSLY WRONG. He (or whoever he copied) just multiplied numbers of gun deaths, drunken driving wrecks, suicides, etc. shown by the National Center for Health Statistics by 400% or 500% and stuck them in his book. The rest is no more accurate. In particular, Bradley fails to mention the real statistics: ages 35-54 (the parents) now have soaring violent death rates far above those of high schoolers. A teenager is twice as likely to have a parent get into a drunken accident, three times more likely to suffer a parent who commits suicide, 10 times more likely to have a parent die from an illicit-drug overdose than the other way around. Bradley can't seem to see this--and he incessantly trashes teens as "crazy"?  Reading this book was like listening to stereotypical seventh-grade alphas ridiculing the "retards." Bradley's name-calling is so obsessive--he berates teenagers as "crazy," "stupid," "nuts," and brain-damaged in frenzied repetition on nearly every page--that it's pathological. He sounds confident and tough, but this book is ultra-permissive when it comes to ignoring the rotten adult behaviors that underlie rotten teenage behaviors.  Having said this, I respect and admire good parents. Good parents know they're not the blameless victims Bradley excuses and that conflicts with teens are nearly always a two-way street. Parents who need help maturely seek it from therapists who will hold all parties accountable, not just encourage them to dismiss every problem with their teenagers as caused by their "large, brain-dysfunctioned children." It's no accident that arrogant, tough-sounding books like this are popular in a time when grownup misbehaviors and disarray are skyrocketing and kids are dealing with more troubled families than ever. After reading authors like this, I wonder if the never-mentioned side of "brain science"--the deterioration in key memory and learning genes and loss of cells that accelerates after age 40--is causing the real craziness we should be worried about 
 It has been a couple years since I've seen this, and I can still honestly say that it's like watching a Andy Warhol movie of Salvor Dail puking.  A kind of swirly colorful mess, with Brendan Fraser and Bridget Fonda stuck in the ooze of ick, and can't escape it's yuck of a screenplay...On a positive note, Jim Carrey isn't in it. Other then that, nothing can redeem Henry Selick, Kaja Blackley, and Sam Hamm for this putrid monstrosity, and I mean that from the bottm of my heart 
    'A Mighty Wind' seems to be 'This is Spinal Tap' done in a folk medium. Unfortunately, the gags and cliches in this film seem to be lifted, as another reviewer stated, from most of Christopher Guest's previous efforts. To put it mildly, halfway through the film I was half-asleep and wishing a dwarf would crush Stonehenge 
 There are perhaps 30 good pages of writing in this book.  30.  Out of 260.  Anne Carson is one of the most over-rated writers to have snuck into the American scene in decades 
 I just bought this CD after reading Nevermore was spawned by the band Sanctuary which I used to like a lot. However I find Nevermore quite a bit more thrashy and not very original. I like Warrel Dane's voice and lyrics but they are somewhat covered up by the instruments and many of the songs are just kind of boring. I havn't heard any other Nevermore CDs but at this point I would have to say Sanctuary was a much better band. At least they could write a decent melody. 
 The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.  
 Certainly, the assignment of this book in a graduate level course must be covered under the Geneva Convention.   Not only is it poorly written, but it is intellectually shallow -- nothing but an assemblage of hackneyed  cliches about how horrible the "dominant culture" in America is.  I cannot believe that I have been assigned this trite tome as the sole text  in a GRADUATE level course.   What's even worse, it provides virtually no  guidance for current or prospective educators about how to effectively  teach a classroom full of students of disparate races, cultures, religions  and socio-economic backgrounds.  What a shame that is, since this is such a  very real need in education today. Thank goodness this is only for a 4-week  summer intersession.   That this book is in its 5TH EDITION is simply  beyond comprehension 
 Amelia's trademark is taking all directions literally without applying reason.  This time she has the insane notion that she's going to play in the school band.  Naturally she bollixes up the works and the show ends on a sour note - literally, thanks to Amelia's blundering miscalculations.  Since baking is her strength, perhaps the conductor will relent if he eats some of her desserts.      
 While this book provides a decent cursory review of East Europe, it is not to be taken as an authority on the subject.  Many times, Roskin will oversimplify political agendas and use imprecise vocabulary to describe his subjects.  For a comprehensive look at the political factors of the area, I would suggest something more along the lines of Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy 
 After reading the 5 Star review on this DVD I purchased it hoping that if it even came close to this recommendation I would be overjoyed. Anyone if even faintly familier with classical piano has heard of Rubinstein who is certainly considered one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century. Unfortunately he is not one of the great actors of the 20th century and this staged production done,I'm guessing for TV or the schoolroom,is truly pathetic. The film is dark and grainey and the fidelity is awful.  I know this was made in 1953 so what should I expect? Better than this.  There are some wonderful classical performances on DVD with supberb audio and video so maybe I'm spoiled. If your looking for a great recording of Rubinstein buy the Phillips Great Pianists of the 20th century 2 CD set. You won't be disappointed.       
 I've watched Mark Bittman on PBS and really liked his style.  I have some cooking skills, but would like to be better and thought this book would be a good start.  I was wrong.  I tried a couple of recipes and they all failed.  The eggplant saute and the boiled shrimp were waaay off in their instructions and were inedible. This is not a good book.  I would recommend Cooks Illustrated magazine and At Blanchard's Table.  These have been great resources for me to help me improve my cooking skills and understand why certain things are done certain ways.  Plus there's always the Alton Brown show Good Eats on the FoodNetwork 
 I would say that if you were a Britcom fan, this would only tantalize you and leave you wanting sooo much more.  If you really wish to get all the goodies, take the jump and get the full sets.  You will regret not knowing what went on after the first series for these well performed shows of British wit.  Also you should not forget "The Vicar of Dibley".  I waited 7 years for them on DVD, and never regreted spending a penny.  Dawn French and the rest of the cast were Brilliant 
 The author wrote this in the 80's when the future of academia was looking a little bleak so I can forgive him some of his pessimism, but the book is rather dreary and has the principal effect of scaring away those considering a doctoral program (which is perhaps a good thing).  The book has three critical flaws:  it's 100 pages too long, it's dated (especially the material on computers and sexual harassment), and the author has the annoying belief that social science dissertations are the only "full" dissertations.  By suggesting that his own field of Sociology is the most difficult field of study, the author alienates many potential readers and loses any claim of impartial observation.  All of the useful gems of advice are covered in a shorter and more optimistic book written by Evelyn Hunt Ogden on the same subject.  Read that one instead 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power.  David, what happened????  The story is very fascinating but the characters were not.  I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person.  But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable.  He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand.  There were just too many up and downs for me.  I am sure the next book will be back on track 
 Hi,  I am highly regretting buying this mat.  It is too bulky to carry.  And it came on sale in Big 5 for half the price of Amazon 
 This book was suggested to me by one of my co-workers with whom I frequently debated different topics.  I picked it up with slight hesistation because of differences of opinion between the two of us. While Harris addresses several issues within this book, I often felt that he moved between cause's too quickly.  Instead of addressing one cause and demonstrating it's impact on the myth completly, he tends to introduce the point, and then just as quickly move on to the next point with out finalizing his point. I think I may have enjoyed the point a bit more had he followed through on his points a bit more. The other issue I had with this book boiled down to Harris' writing style.  While reading the book, I felt as though every other sentence was "I believe", "I will demonstrate", "I propose", etc.  It should be understood that these are the authors points, that is why his name is on the cover.  The inclusion of these phrases detracted from the reading of this book while adding nothing to the subject at hand.  The book also seemed to be written as a teaching aid to a college class in the regards that at the end of the chapters, it felt as if there was no conclusion reached....almost that the book was written to introduce thoughts and to promote speculation by the readers, without taking a stance on the issues at hand. Overall, this book had the potential to be a real page turner, but the authors questionable writing style made it almost unreadable, at least for this reader 
 The design of the bed is awesome.  Unfortunately it would not hold air.  There were no visible flaws.  The instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used.  The bed would not hold air at all.  (I only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st)  I purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing.  I love the design but I am disappointed in the quality 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 I attended a workshop with this dangerous charlatan. I was truly shocked by what I witnessed. This self-procliamed messiah had an almost hypnotic effect on his devotees. He appealed to their egos by telling them they are the "chosen ones" privy to the wisdom of the "ancient mystery schools." But there's a catch,to be a part of his special circle one must embrace thier darkness. "I am the darkness" is the mantra of those who follow this man. And the results are what you might expect puppet-like people who slump and then stand to attention depending on their master's pull of the string. 
 This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow 
 As to the people commenting on the below reviews being self-promotion, let me just say that I work in a chain-bookstore which has recently been hit by a plague of special orders for this book by a person whose address and phone number don't really exist. The book in non-returnable to the publisher, so we are stuck with it on our shelves. I'll let you try to figure out for yourself who that person might be 
 i cant fit a normal mattress in my new apt so i need this till i move i had it a month and the one of the seams tore and kept getting bigger i couldnt patch it because the hole was on the velour side so i had to buy a new one. im not buyin a swiss air mattress agai 
 I totally agree with the previous two reviewers.  Unfortunately, I got this DVD before they posted their reviews.  I came back here to warn people not to be misled by the title and the rating.  There is absolutely no sex or violence in this movie.  Keri is not such a great actress and the plot is not worth mentioning.  So what's left! 
 I bought this book with much enthusiasm after reading reviews since I wanted to study more about power animals and be able to share some information with others.  Well, there are no water animals except "whale", "dolphin" and "seal" so when we looked up fish, crab, octopus, and frog, we found nothing.  My power animal is the cockatoo - well, there was not even parrot to look up. Bottom line, there are only 36 animals with information.  For those of you who believe in totem animals and power animals, you know that for each person, there may be several animals to look up.  This book is not for those who are looking for a complete selection (obviously, within each species you find so many but it would be nice to at least list the main categories).    "Native beliefs explain that a totem animal is one that is with you for life, often an animal with whom you share a connection, either through interest in the animal or your resemblance to or shared characteristics of the animal in question. A power animal or spirit animal is a spirit in animal form that comes through with a specific lesson for you, and will change throughout the course of your life." 
 Hayward has nothing new to offer--merely another prideful preachment to the already converted: those members of a privileged yet considerable contingent that has access to "absolute truth" and who are renewed in their faith by assurances that a long-ago, inconvenient wait at the gas pump, temporarily high interest rates (a boon for savers), and a comparatively minor incident (the Iranian hostage crisis)  were, first of all,  Carter's "fault" and, secondly, equivalent to the debacle of Iraq and the world's perception (96% of the population of our planet) that America does what it pleases, which in this case is to wage an indefensible war against Islam.  Note the book's title (supposedly that of a "scholarly" historian), which is nothing more than a fault-finding, two-bit harangue, picking up where Limbaugh, Coulter and company left off, for a change scapegoating an individual instead of "them" (the "liberal" media).  Next it begs the question (a specific logical fallacy) by characterizing and condemning Clinton and Kerry in its alleged "description" of them.  Finally, in the book itself the author spends page after page setting up a straw man (some figure whom he claims is worshipped by everybody in America) so he has something to shoot at.  This book is nothing more than a rallying cry for the neo-conservative base (true believers, guardians of "absolute" truth and morality, America-first as God intended) who have screwed up big-time and would rather not face up to it.  (Can't blame them.  It's a helluva mess they've created, so why not blame it all on the little peanut farmer?)  Absurd?  Worse. We have now created a world not safe for anyone's children or grandchildren.  It's time to end this kind of cheap sniping and look to solutions--or to Rwanda.  Perhaps by allowing American civilians to enlist as United Nations soldiers (as Canadians, Irish, and Australians do), we could gain some redemption in the eyes of the world, being seen as peacemakers rather than as self-serving, xenophobic (unless oil is involved), childish whiners.  It's time to make order rather than encourage further disorder.  A book that sanctions living in denial is the last thing we need 
 I picked up this book based on the recommendation by Stephen King in Danse Macabre. I liked the mood and the basic premise of the book, but the constant shifting in viewpoint between the characters and the jumping back and forth from the present to past events just made me quit reading half way. It just became too irritating and with over a year's reading to do on my bookshelf, I just couldn't justify spending any more time on it. I am sure more forgiving readers will enjoy the novel, but I personally expect a novel to be structured in a way to encourage the reader to keep reading. Unfortunately for me, it ceased to be fun and became a chore instead.  This is only the third book that I have started reading and didn't finish in my entire life. It was that bad for me. With the praise I keep reading about Straub, I would be willing to give him another shot. But it won't be this book 
 I realize that this book is for "Idiots", but come on.  Shallow coverage of HRM.  I can't believe the author reviewed his own book and gave himself 5 stars.  He's not biased at all.  Not worth the money. 
 Decent camera, but not great.  Shark mode is nice.  Housing looks good, but mine leaked at ~20 ft...camera was dead by the time I got it out of the water.  Good news is that Amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week.  Net result was one decent picture and a disappointing Christmas present.  Next time I will buy a housing for a better camera.  Canon has some nice ones 
 This book was indeed a quickie, in more ways than one.  First of all, the romance came together too quickly.  Chapter two ceased the intensity of the infatuation stage when the two characters were already touching.  BORING.   Not that touching is boring, but when you read a romance novel, you like a  little bit of anticipation and challenge between your characters.   Secondly, I would liked to have read more about Graham and his relationship  with his long lost daughter.  Seems that the plot was quickly thrown in at  the last minute and wasn't very interesting to read.  Tug at my heart  strings with rekindled love, between family or intimates, and give me an  ending that will make me sigh.  Don't get me wrong, the story was cute, but  I think most romance readers like a little temptation and saavy, not a  steeple-chased love story 
 I am a Navy Wife of four years facing my first deployment as a wife and I found this book to be the corniest thing I've ever read. EVER.  The "comical" stories everyone seems to be gushing over sound like they were pulled right out of a dusty old Reader's Digest. I didn't find the book to be informative and I found the definition section of the book to be incredibly trite and boring.   Example: Term Active Duty, Military Speak: Actively serving and deployable. Spouse Speak: This means your address is written in pencil in address books.  Dear God. How incredibly lame. Military members move. Yes. It's true. We ALL know that. Civilians know this. EVERYONE knows this. This poor attempt at humor is dull and over-used.  I didn't learn ANYTHING from this book and would NOT recommend this to anyone  SERIOUSLY looking for information or advice about military life or deployments. You can get USEFUL information by going to your local Fleet and Family Support Center or attending a pre-deployment brief. 
 This documentary is not one of John Grisham's best works. At times the book was hard to follow however he did make his point in the end. I think Grisham's talent is writing fiction and he should stick with that. 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY. I just received my "Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill" and have attempted to assemble it. The handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console. The Customer Service numbers are all disconnected. Their website gives an additional number to call, and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers, or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you. I have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them. This company is a complete scam. If you are even considering buying one of their products, your money is better spent getting your head checked 
 Yeah, those folks in the 50's sure were paranoid and gullible. Ha ha. How anyone could possibly think that the subject of nuclear holocaust and the fear thereof could be milked for a few laughs is pathetic. But even if this film was entirely based on a fictional threat the vast majority of its fitful stabs at humor require a deeper state of inebriation than I would care to endure 
 Much smaller then other similar histories it is lacking in many areas. It skips many classic versions of the caped crusader in favor of a commercial promoting the current "Dark Age of Comics". It doesn't bother with many of the best and landmark portrayals such as Adam West's 60's TV series, The Superfriends, the radio and movie serials, the classic cartoons and more. There was no example of the best writers and artists, among them Adams, Aparo, Robinson and Sprang. A very abbreviated account. They could have done better and since they probably will when the new Batman movie comes out why bother to buy this book? save your money and wait until a better one is published 
 I put this book down after the eighth test out of sheer frustration. I picked it up at my local library just for something fun to do, as I know myself pretty well through my own experiences and introspection over the years. I usually enjoy personality tests, and am even sometimes surprised at the amazing accuracy of the more famous ones, such as the Myers-Briggs. I was a bit disturbed that I was finding such inaccurate answers, at the least the ones I could even understand how to score. I scored well out of the norms on every test, which I think is odd as I am college-age myself. Out of the first eight that I took, Who Controls Your Fate was probably the most accurate, and easiest to understand scoring-wise. It's just disturbing that this is a compilation of tests from various sources, and 7 out of the 8 I took had answers that I felt were pretty far off.  The scoring was also very difficult. Some of the instructions on how to score were almost impossible to decipher, which could have led to some of my obscenely off scores. Other tests would not even define what was a "good" or "bad" score, you were left to decide on your own!    The book just seems to have been quickly thrown together with very poor explanations. I suggest finding a book that delves more into one type of personality test, such as a book on Myers-Briggs or Enneagrams. 
 I ordered this book for my 3 year old nephew and was surprised to receive a book without any words. I think in the description of the book, rather than saying "English", it should say picture book.  I am a fan of Mercer Mayer but preferred to buy one that this little boy could grow into in his reading 
 GET A PS3 60 gig version.. IT has this technology built right in plus u get the best gaming system on earth till 2011.

 Don't bother with these.  I am a school nurse, and not just this brand, but MOST brands of ear thermometers are inconsistent, especially when the average person does incorrect positioning in the ear canal.  I had to use the ear type for 8 years between Pediatric ICU and school nursing.  I got pretty good at getting consistent readings, except on very small ear canals, and those with a lot of wax.  We got rid of ours and went with an Exergen TemporalScanner Temporal Artery Thermometer.  It takes less time, doesn't require probes, and you can get one at Costco for $30 
 As a fan of N. Farmer after reading The House of The Scorpions, I had grasped this book with enthusiasm.  Sadly, I now question my admiration towards the author.  This book, set in early saxon era, gives overly descriptive and frank and straight forward counts of the Norse people's heinous actions, without consideration of the ages of her readers:  page 105 - "The sad eyed woman collapsed.  She hadn't been strong to begin with.  Olaf dragged her up, and with a swift movement that made Jack cry out, he cut her throat and threw her over the side."  And, that's just a tip of the iceberg.  Try a search on "cut" within this book and you will find dozens of more of these decadent actions that I truly do not believe that a young person should be reading.    	In regards the characters, I have to agree with other one-star givers, that there are no character buildings within the story.  I did not see any special ability nor courage in Jack, who was chosen to the bard's apprentice.  His sister, Lucy, is a retard - thinking the Norsemen who captured them are some king's men who came to take her back to be a princess.  Thorgil, who is one of the "shield maiden" is absurdly defiant - how she still survived the odyssey, is outrageous.  And, of course, Olaf - whose suicidal downfall was inevitable in a battle with an invincible opponent called a troll-bear.    	Only good part I see in this book is how the author tried to weave and bestows the knowledge of Norse mythology upon the readers.  The book is crammed with trolls, Asgard, Jotuns, Freya and etcetera.  It is filled with good knowledge.  Yet, the storytelling is very hectic.  Surroundings and atmospheres are left undescribed.  The novel bounds along with hiatus leaving to wonder as if this book should have been a trilogy where many sections seem detracted to fulfill the publisher's encumbrances rather than the author's artistry to shorten a potentially a greater novel to a mere kiddies' read.  	To fulfill the knowledge of Norse mythology, I would recommend "D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths"  
 First, the good:  this book is GREAT, it was a Christmas gift for my dad who has been a Broncos fan since Day One - 1960 (the first year the team played in the AFL.)  He loves it, and loves remembering all of the old Broncos stories  Now the bad: I ordered the autographed, leather-bound, $50 version of this book in AUGUST of 2006!!  It was originally scheduled to be delivered in November.....then that was pushed back to Janurary, which of course misses the whole point, which was to have it by Christmas, but whatever.  Then, in Janurary I get an email saying it has been delayed AGAIN and won't arrive until March.  Well, forget it.  Cancel that order.  Order a "regular" version.  Two weeks later - STILL no book.  I call Amazon.  Order the book for the THIRD TIME, and they send it 2-day shipping.....the second book never arrived.  Nice process, Amazon and whoever was responsible for the autographed, limited edition book!! 
 "Why geography matters" did not deliver according to me. Though it may be very interesting for people not very familiar with geography and how it does matter in ordinary life as well as for global issues, it seemed to me anyone a bit aware of these very issues will not learn much 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 This is mostly a picture book with very little detail.  I read it in under an hour and still had no idea about issues like electrical, pump size, and caluculating flow for a waterfall.  If I was in a brick and mortar store, I  would have never bought this title.  Instead, I have found a lot of use out  of "Ortho's All about Garden Pools and Fountains" 
 This book is a good idea in principle but clever clogs Mr Maltin seems to know nothing about films. Whiles he raves about old fashioned stinkers such as Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Psycho, he is far less complimentary about classics such as Weekend at Bernie's, Gremlins 2 and Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach. I think Mr Maltin should learn to keep his so-called opinions to himself in future. Verdict: A very expensive doorstop 
 This item sucks, got it, broke second time I tried using it. Simply do not buy this overpriced piece of plastic 
 Though I respected Allan Bloom's translation and introduction to Rousseau's "Emile", "The Closing of the American Mind" shows his inadequacy as a social theorist as well as an academic.  The worthy, though somewhat obvious, point here is Bloom's recognition of America's movement away from intellectualism.  Ironically, this work filled with tenuous arguements makes a case that intellectuals (if one considers Bloom this) have very little to offer (and may be incapable of understanding) society. His comments on music, culture, and race are embarrassingly naive and insipid.  One of the more glaring deficiencies here was the treatment of German philosophy; I don't know that there is a notable scholar who has more misunderstood Nietzsche than Bloom.  He should stick to translating French and leave interpretation up to more worthy critics.    
 In her first work to be translated into English, Ami Sakurai's Innocent World is a quick peek into every middle class parent's nightmare: incest, casual prostitution, rape, and the utter nihilism of today's bourgeois youth. Part document of the numbed state of teenagers in Tokyo, part manga-like read, this novella is the book for those with an interest in the underbelly of Shibuya youth culture, in particular of how young women are able to divorce their bodies from their minds in pursuit of money - and what they will do for it. The protagonist of Innocent World, Ami, is Every Young Girl in Tokyo: educated parents who send her to a private school, an absent father, a young woman lacking nothing who is utterly devoid of feeling. The only possible twist is that her older brother is retarded. She discovers that she was the product of fertility treatments that involved a sperm donor not her father (her mother did not want another child with developmental problems, for which she blamed her salaryman husband). This leads Ami in pursuit of Number 307: the man who donated his seed. On the way she prostitutes herself - perhaps out of boredom, perhaps out of resentment - and becomes physically and emotionally involved with her half-brother. A depressing if insightful read 
 I don't want to compare this album to all of Liz's other albums but it's hard not to. Yes artists would like you to take their work for what it is at the moment and I have done that. I must say some of the songs on the record, I can almost see the Liz of old, lyrics-wise. She has some wit on this album and towards the end of the album there are some more listenable songs.   Liz obviously felt something wasn't right about her music or it could be all about the money like many have said. This was a very blatant attempt to sell records, something that I would have NEVER come out of the young woman who released such an underground classic as Exile in Guyville. Her 2nd and 3rd efforts were great with Whip Smart only a notch away from surpassing Guyville.   Nonethesless I gave this 2 stars instead of one because I love Liz's music ALOT and she was the best female rock singer/songwriter of the 90s, forget Alanis, Tori Amos and the countless copiers.   BTW her next album is much more tolerable 
 In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.  While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.  According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).  The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.    One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God."  He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.  In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.   According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.  Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.  In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.    While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations. 
    This book is absolutely terrible!  It contains explicit religious content (Christian, no less;-) for no reason at all.  More importantly, this story is taken SO FAR out of context, it looses ALL meaning and emotional impact.  Why are the white people so mad?  Why are the children segregated in the first place?  I don't know for which grade this is intended; but whichever it is, the students ask those questions.    One of the author's more recent books is on Bruce Springsteen, OK?  'Nuff Said?      If you see Robert Coles, wish hateful stuff on him for me. The illustrator is culpable by association 
 All textbooks over $50 are a rip off, WRITE A LETTER TO YOUR STATE SENATOR TELLING THEM YOU WON'T STAND FOR THESE OUTRAGEOUS PRICES ON TEXTBOOKS FOR SCHOOL.  MOST STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES!!!  WE CAN BEAT THE ENDLESS NEW EDITION CYCLES THAT PUBLISHERS RIP US OFF WITH IF WE MAKE IT KNOWN!! WE CAN'T AND WON'T STAND FOR THIS 
 I looked forward to solid information in this book that wouldn't easily be found elsewhere, but the writer repeats some of the points he's already made rather than going further into the lives of these composers. In general, the information is less substantive than I thought I might find 
 What a huge disappointment and waste of money!  Janet Evanovich should be ashamed of herself, and I'll know not to buy any book by the co-author, Leanne Banks.  The 2 primary characters fell in love way too fast and for no good reason.  The only reason this rates even 1 star is because there was some mildly amusing dialog here and there.  "Pugg" should have been named "Pigg" because he was a disgusting pig and not at all likeable.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  I can't say it enough 
 I wanted to see Natalie Portman in what I thought was a real acting role. The only other movies I've seen her in was Leon the Professional (which I thought she was superb in), and Phantom Movie. I fail to see how she was nominated for best supporting actress in this movie. Maybe it was a weak year in female actors? She did a fine job, but I do not believe it was worthy of being nominated.  Now, onto the movie.  This is basically Seinfeld with big name stars. A pointless movie, that was so slow and no plot... I was sleeping through half the movie, and I lost interest after the introduction of Natalie's ("Alice"). Jude Law did the best job in this wretched film.  He pulled off the "loser character, and failed author mentality."  I don't get this movie, or why it was even made, but, I am not into similar movies.  This movie, supposedly about people who lost love, or was in love...no. I don't think so.  There was no love in this movie.  It was lust, pure teen-age hormones running rampant.  All it lacked were true teenagers.   The chemistry lacked between all of the characters, except between the characters and I did not believe in them.  Other than that... For a brief moment, I did believe in Natalie's Alice and Jude's Dan. Oh well. I guess I don't understand this movie at all, but I also didn't care about them. The characters were despicable and annoying (like Seinfeld).  Oh yes, there were many wasted scenes.  Such as, the photo shoots scenes. Who cares?  Why bother showing that?   As funny as the internet "chatting" scene between Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen), it was almost as meaningless.  Certainly, it was far too long.  The producer, director and scriptwriter should be knocked over the head with such a bad movie.  I don't blame any of the actors at all, they tried their best in their limited functions in this garbage. That said, Natalie Portman needs to use her talents and beauty in better roles.  
 I agree with the first review (one star...). However, the book could be  useful for someone who is starting to make his way in learning in strategic  games. I would also mention that 3'5 floppy comes with the book (C code for  DOS platform) so the fact that 80% of the book is a source listing is  annoying. Begginers would find first couple of chapters interesting though 
 I did laugh and was mildly entertained and never bored with this one.   The DVD commentary also includes some other stories that are also pretty funny and explain some of the pitfalls of an underfunded movie, which explains some of the end product here, I would think.  Of course, I had seen the Ebert&Roeper review of this movie beforehand so I was not expecting much.  In fact, I was curious about a movie they found so terrible.  And "Dirty Love" is not all that great, it was not as bad as I expected either.  My wife hated...HATED...this film, so I would not call it a "chick flick". 
 This product does not work, is ugly, and - worst of all - is expensive. The makers should be ashamed of themselves. Using different types of water does not make this useless product work 
 I didn't find this book helpful, and here's why:  My 10 year old daughter tends to over eat and crave unhealthy foods, so I'm working on educating her on nutrition and keeping her active.  I thought this book looked like a good resources, but the problem is that it looks like a young child's book, even though it contains good information in the second half, appropriate to an older child.  So, my 10 year old took one look at it, declared it a 'baby's book' (because the cover and art and first pages look like it's designed for a very young child), and I couldn't get her further in it, because she prides herself on now being able to read 'big kid' (chapter type) books.  The packaging/art approach just don't match the level of the content 
 From looking at the D-Link website and talking to five tech support staff, it appears that there are countless versions of this card, each with different driver software. The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal "automatic" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2. So I called back again. And again. And again.  Despite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot. Remove the program. Reboot. Install from the new driver. Reboot. Remove the program. Talk to a senior tech support person. Install from CD. Reboot. etc. It would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they're doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort.  I spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card! I am not alone in this experience; see cnet's web site user reviews of the DWL-G650.  Another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it. The DWL-G650 is bad news. I give them two stars cause they actually have tech support, though in this case it was utterly worthless.  Back it goes 
 We got this as a gift & used it.....its loud and spits out water.  We're not happy with it 
 the book contained good exercises, but all are available in any book or from anyone in a gym you ask, the routines were to complicated and not enough attention paid to them, escpecially for beginners or intermediates, the book focused to much on bodybuilding for pro's. if your a beginner or intermediate bodybuilder find a better book you'll only be disapointed with this, especially since the author spends a large proportion of the time talking about previous or current bodybuilders, i didnt buy the book to read about other people, the nutrition section is also useless.....i recommend one of arnies book 
 I purchased this book hoping to get a fresh perspective - why do people choose a suburban lifestyle and how that shapes society. Instead, I got 275+ pages of the same elitest criticism.  It's important to understand what the author is describing as suburb vs. city. I picked this up expecting to find a NY vs. Levvitown or Chicago vs. Park Forest argument. It seems that the "cities" in this book are not your major metropolitan areas, but smaller cities, around 250,000 in population or so. When you read on, you'll see why he is concentrating on these examples - all of his cities' "haves" and the suburbs "have nots" would be shattered when applied to Manhattan.   Next issue I take with the book is that there are a lot of claims made, but not a shred of data to back them up! I agree with a lot of the points that he is trying to make, but if you can't solidify your argument with some statistics (and they are out there for this sort of research), then your book is nothing more than an opinion and rhetoric. One example was that there is much more socio-economic diversity in the Georgetown neighborhood of DC and that the secretaries and teachers live alongside the lawyers. If Mr. Duany were to pull up the socio-economic data from a Georgetown zip code (and this information is readily available, I just found it on google), he would see that this is most certainly not true. As another reviewer pointed out, just stating it does not make is so.  Finally, one of the other shortcomings in the book were the photos and the footnotes that contradict the argument. An example is a discussion of how a main street shopping district is superior because nobody needs to drive - they can walk home, to work, to shop, and to play. All garage space is provided in alleys, creating the author's version of utopia. But if this is true, then why is the accompanying photo showing a main street in Boca Raton that has not one open parking spot? Seems that this isn't quite the utopia that he is painting, and people still are driving, regardless if it is to get home, shop, to go to work, etc. There are also some points made in footnotes, which I passed over at first thinking that they were just citations. Turns out that sometimes they are counterpoints, that if he had added in the regular paragraph, would have destroyed his point. Come on now, that is just silly. If you have to conceed a point that weakens the argument, don't insult the intelligence of your audience by trying to hide it.  While this is a fascinating topic to me, I have to say that this is a very narrow-minded view that is lacking on anything concrete or even original 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 Well, truth be told, I am a die hard Barbara Michaels fan (aka. Elizabeth Peters).  I exausted my Barbara books and decided to switch to one of her Elizabeth Peters novels.  Since I didn't want to get into a whole series like the Peabody series or what not, I picked this book.     What a let down!!!    OK, it kept my intrest and wasen't a total waste of time, but the story was predictable from the middle of the book.  Maybe even the beginning. Normaly when I read one of her books I feverishly tear through the last 20 pages or so.  Yeah, this one contained the quintessential explination and the "wrap up", but there was no basis to it.  I came to the last page and thought  THATS IT, you gotta be kidding me.  
 I agree with the poster below, what a rip off!  I have been searching all over for the Jess Hutch booklet, and when the cover of this magazine showed the knitted robots and also the banner "Stitch a Robot," I figured I would pick the magazine up just for that... let me tell you when I turned to the page and it was a totally different robot that was CROCHETED, which I can not do... I was very dissappointed.  Total waste 
 The graphics and sample marketing materials in this manual were so cheesy, I could hardly keep a straight face. Without a doubt, it dated this material and made it seem useless to me. The information was alright.. but still pretty basic, and sometimes too random 
 First, I hardly ever write reviews...but after this story, I needed to state something.  Second, I am not considered a conservative and relatively open minded. Third, I always appreciate history and culture...and understand this story was handed down through generations.  However, never reading this story myself and reading it to my three and a half year old for the first time - I had to stop half way through the book after realizing the heart of the story surrounds a monkey killing a baby owl and the jungle searches for the killer while the mother owl grieves.  To complement the story, there is an illustration of the monkey (snarl showing sharp teeth) hitting the baby owl over the head with a branch...not a bedtime story for this family.  It was given as a gift, and will be returned shortly.. 
 It seems like Koolhaas can never get out of graphic design architecture. At one point he became interesting but is now becoming like fashion designers where trend and surface have more meaning. Perhaps, he should quit architecture and become a graphic or fashion designer.  Delirious Koolhaas.   The Prada Boutique in Beverly Hills is quite nice. I recommend seeing his real buildings instead of buying books and if you have to buy his books, I recommend you first read "Delirious New York" and look at his competition entries for Park de la Villette and early works 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 I cannot recommend this novel to any reader.  It had too many aspects of the countless, over-the-top feminist rants that are becoming so tiresome.  It was predictable that one of the few decent men in the story was dispatched toward the end so that the women could resume their life together.  The history, the relationships and the settings were unbelievable. 
 I think if you're going to be a self-respecting zombie, you'd much prefer the ability to buy canned baby brains from the delicacy store than bite it out of a living human. I mean ... you're tired, your muscles feel like sweat socks and you don't just suddenly get this urge to gnaw on living bodies. So that's why I was so excited when I saw the zombies heading to the mall. Hell, yeah, they got baby in a can, right? Wrong! This is just some sick excuse to hire your special effects pot buddy who took everything Black Sabbath sung about literally. Think about it, George Romero -- in his sick, twisted way -- is merely editorializing that we should kill all those who have AIDS, just line 'em up in a row and pick 'em off like bottles on a fence. As if they're going around and biting peole to infect everybody. Maybe George just plain hates zombies 
 After reading the book I can understand the disparity in the customer  reviews. "State of Mind" was a disappointment to me as I found  Mr. Katzenbach's "Hart's War" & "Shadowman" among  the best books I have ever read. Parts of "State of Mind" just  flew by and I became quite engrossed...then periods of dull nonaction.  Perhaps it was just too long. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Katzenbach's  writing there were many times I would have quit this one. Kept figuring it  would pick up in the next chapter. Ending is a pretty good payoff, but  takes too long to get there and it's a plodding journey. Set in a Blade  Runner world the overall plot made sense and the characters were well  drawn. Mr. Katzenbach has entertained me before and will again 
 While this is a brisk read, as a good popular history should be, I am concerned by errors in the text.  One example suffices.  In Chapter 2, Kelly describes the infamous Fourth Crusade thusly: "Venetian authorities offered a group of French Crusaders free passage to the Holy Land, then rerouted the Crusaders east to capture Constantinople."  Wrong on virtually every count.  Then as now, Venetians gave nothing away free.  The Doge and the leaders of the Crusade agreed on a (healthy) price for transport by sea to Egypt (not Palestine).  When the troops arrived at the port, however, the Crusaders proved to be short of funds, and were unable to raise the balance.  Only then were they diverted to the sack of Zara and then of Constantinople as a means of paying their debt to Venice.  See Norwich, "A History of Venice" for the details.  Now, if Kelly can get an episode as well-known and well-documented as the Fourth Crusade so wrong, how can one trust his judgment on other issues?  Especially on such issues as epidemiology, which few readers (myself included) are likely to know much about?  I also note that the author apparently personally responded to one of the negative reviews posted here.  I would rather that he respond to the one that accuses him of plagiarism.  I do hope it's unfounded.    
 I haven't seen the film but there's still not much to like about the book. It's full of lame cliches and silly (without being entertaining) fight scenes 
 Same stuff you hear in the news.  Doesn't tell you about why or how her marriage broke up or anything else really.  
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 Brandy and Jimmy Loves Mary-Ann are two spectacular songs.  They are worth the whole price of this CD.  They had better be.  The rest of the album is worthless.  There is not one memorable song on the rest of the album.  But, so what, I've listened to these two songs about 50 times and they are beautiful.  I know that so-called "one-hit wonders" is a common pattern in pop music. But, how could any songwriter have two musical ideas as outstanding as these, and then find himself with nothing more to say 
 I recently ordered this book - what a disappointment!  This book profiles luxury beach hotels around the world and includes leading hotels in locales such as the Seychelles, Maldives, Oman, Bora Bora and numerous other places.  There are two problems however.  First, the quality of the pictures is inconsistent - some pictures are good but there are too many that are blurry. Also, many of the pictures are from the hotels themselves.  The problem with this is that the pictures can be found on the websites of these hotels already and can be viewed for free.  Second, the descriptions of the hotels are poorly written and provide next to no information.  I could go on but why bother - Skip this one 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 This book was horrible. Had to skip to the end to get through it. I have read all of s.k.'s books and I was shocked by how bad this book was.  In the future instead of buying them, will test them through the library 
 Gary B. Nash's purpose for the book is, "to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the Mississippi River." (Nash, xxviii)  Nash bemoans how the "great men" still "dominate the master narrative [of the American Revolution,]" (Nash, xv) and that we are struck with "historical amnesia," (Nash, xvi) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the "great men" clique.  He states that we cannot capture the essence of the Revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society.  These groups not only include the poor farmers, artisans, and other laborers, but also of women, blacks (both free and slave), and of the AmerIndian population.    Nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories.  To illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society, he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries, which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the Parliament.  He also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which, in his estimation, helped to spur change all along the way.  In the case of the inhabitants of what would become Vermont, he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in New York City.  Led by Ethan Allen, the "Green Mountain Boys," as they would become known as, fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the New York City landowners had for their property.  (Nash, 110 - 114)  He also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the Carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well.  (Nash, 73 - 79)  In the case of the "Green Mountain Boys," their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the Carolina piedmont, whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of North Carolina, William Tryon.  Nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution.  In Nash's estimation, these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society, as championed by the Founding Fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era.  In Pennsylvania, the 1776 state constitution was heralded by Nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature, its weak executive, and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state.  He also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution.  (Nash, 271 - 286)  In states where the constitution did adhere to these premises, Nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people, as evident by the problems Massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook.  (Nash, 302 - 304)  The talk of freedom and equality also spread, according to Nash, to the black population in the American colonies.  These ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population, but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land.  This spread of ideas to the black population, particularly the enslaved portion, troubled white leaders, according to Nash (Nash, 59)  What was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise.  (Nash, 37 - 39)  What else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the British actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the British Crown.  (Nash, 157 - 164)  Nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the Founding Fathers were disseminating across the land.  Nash believes that this rhetoric, and its implications, were inescapable to the slaves.  (Nash, 64)  He also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the British; they were transported off either to Nova Scotia or to the Caribbean Islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland.  (Nash, 426 - 427)   Women also were praised in this work, as Nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict.  First, women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution.  Nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts, the measures would not have proved effective.  This is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands.  If they did not adhere to the boycotts, the measure would have failed, in Nash's estimation.  (Nash, 141 - 144)  Nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war, specifically in response to rising prices for necessities.  Nash showed us the response of many women in the Boston area to Thomas Boylston, a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed.  In response to these rising prices, women marched on Boylston's shop, and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies, to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices.  (Nash, 232 - 235)  The plight of the American Indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the Appalachian Mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various Indian nations.  Nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics, from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands, (Nash, 253 - 255) to the fact that many Indian nations chose to align themselves with the British in their cause to suppress the rebellion.  (Nash, 151 - 157)  What was more alarming to Nash is the colonists' "genocidal" policies towards the native population.  (Nash, 377 - 381)  Although it may not seem like it, there is an underlying premise to Nash's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the American Revolution.  That premise with Nash, at first alluded to, and then by the end of the book, states bluntly is class warfare.  There is, however, a very real problem in this Marxist outlook on American society during the era of the Revolution, specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today, or even as class was viewed in when Karl Marx wrote his tracts on such matters.  As Gordon Wood pointed out in his work, The Radicalism of the American Revolution, "The social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions, business exploitation, or various isms - capitalism, racism, etc. - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government."  (Wood, 5)  Wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to American society, which fell along "local, regional, sectional, ethnic and class differences."  These complexities made, "any generalization about Americans as a whole," quite difficult.  (Wood, 6)  Wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as Nash proposed in his work.  Wood stated in his review on Nash's work in the "New Republic Online": Nash's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the Revolution.  This mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians, who have produced a literature about it.  Unfortunately, these phenomena do not support Nash's argument.  Not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the Revolution, but the urban mobs, which were indeed directed at British authority, did not represent the class upheaval that Nash assumes.  The rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances, and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare.  (Wood, "New Republic Online Review)   Wood, in his review of Nash's work, went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in American society when he stated: But what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that Nash draws on to make his case for class warfare?  There was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century American society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades, but it was not the one that Nash describes.  Instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class, as Nash sees it, anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees, eighteenth-century American society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands--many of them the businessmen of the future.   In Nash's work, he viewed many of the Revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom.  Nash, I would argue, hinted toward the idea that the Founding Fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves.  Throughout the course of the book, Nash takes great care to "expose" the double standards of the Founding Fathers, making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their "elitists" lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below.  There is no bigger whipping boy for Nash than John Adams, who, according to Nash, was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people.  To be sure, Adams did have his reservations about the people, but it was more a fear of a "tyranny of the masses" than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation.  However, what is truly ironic is that Nash relied so heavily upon the writings of John Adams to illustrate many of his points.  Not only did he rely on Adams' writings, but also the writings of many of the other Founding Fathers.  Throughout the course of the book, when Nash referred to any of the writings of the Founding Fathers, I found myself wondering if Nash was cropping their words to support his case.  It is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than I can provide here.  What is also ironic is that Nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell.  Outside of the use of Joseph Plumb Martin's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the Continental Army during the war and the autobiography of Ethan Allen, he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience, both in the military and in the civilian sector.  To be sure, there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era.  Would their writings bear out what Nash proposed?  Nash criticized the Continental Congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries.  This inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke: they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution.  When Robert Morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army, Nash viewed it as an attempt to "tame the social and political radicalism of the Revolution."  (Nash, 367)  However, I suppose Nash chose to forget the fact that Morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort.  Why then would Thomas Paine, one who Nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy, agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of Robert Morris in favor of his new fiscal plan.  (Nash, 395)  If Morris' plan was so stifling to democracy, intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution, then why would Paine agree to be a party to it?  Not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with Nash's outlook on Morris and the Founding Fathers at large.  Further, if the Founding Fathers truly wanted rule for themselves, there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the "Newburgh Conspiracy."  It is true that the soldiers and officers of George Washington's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the Congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities.  (Nash, 370 - 371)  However, what Nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy.  The men wanted to march on the Continental Congress and put George Washington in power.  Washington, through an impassioned speech and performance, quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again.  Nash, as stated previously, believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era.  He believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously.  However, I would like to offer my own take on this.  Did it take pamphlets from the Founding Fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation?  I certainly think not.  Frederick Douglass' autobiography indicates that from a very early age, he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself.  In an illustration, a still teenage Douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of Baltimore and they complained about their lot in life.  Douglass illustrated the point when he wrote, "You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life!"  (Douglass, 53)  While Douglass certainly is an exceptional individual, I doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind.  Nash lamented the "genocidal policies" towards the AmerIndians adopted by many colonists during the revolution.  While it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives, first, this was nothing new by this point in American history.  Warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that European settlers stepped onto the New World.  In such a climate, atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable.  However, Nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions.  Although Nash admitted that the British courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists, even after the revolution was over, he cannot seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force.     Lastly, as stated previously, Nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the Founding Fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the American Revolution.  (Nash, xv)  First, I would ask Mr. Nash, "should we discount what the `great men' did during the war?"  While historians do deal with the "great men" of the American Revolution, I doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below.  Their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war.  We read about the Boston Tea Party, we read about the non-importation of British goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise.  We read about the plight of the Continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country.    What Nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution.  Bruce Chadwick's piece, The First American Army: The Soldiers of the American Revolution, he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the Continental Army through their diaries, letters and records.  Through these written records, we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty, the want of food and clothing, and their battle experiences.  Alfred Young, in The Shoemaker and the Tea Party, offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets, taking part in demonstrations and actions against the British and their oppressive measures.  Women's roles in the revolution are far from ignored.  Mary Beth Norton authored a book, Liberty's Daughter's: The Revolutionary Experience of Women: 1750 -1800, dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the American Revolution, both from the Patriot side and the Loyalist side.  Linda Kerber also wrote a piece on women in the American Revolution entitled, Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America, which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries, letters and legal papers.  The Native Americans receive their fair share of print as well.  Alan Taylor wrote Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution, which offers a rich, sprawling history focusing on the Iroquois Six Nations of New York and Upper Canada during the era of the American Revolution.  Taylor examines Indians' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it.  Colin Calloway, in his work, The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities, explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to Indian nations involved with the American Revolution.  The African-American population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals.  Glenn Knoblock wrote, Strong and Brave Fellows: New Hampshire's Black Soldiers and Sailors of the American Revolution: 1775 - 1784, which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the American Revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict.  Sylvia Frey, in her book, Water from a Rock: Black Resistance in a Revolutionary Age, explored the triangular relationship between the British, the Americans, and slaves in the South.  Through this triangular relationship, Frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the South during the rebellion.  Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic, edited by Jeffrey Palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that Nash presents, the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the American Revolution.  The political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the United States was not just the product of a few "Founding Fathers," but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement; print media more politically potent than that of later eras; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race, gender, and class.  Thus, this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution, as Nash is guilty of being caught up in.  These are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that Nash covered and, to be sure, there are many more.  These books are not hard to find.  Just do a search on Amazon's or Barnes and Noble's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that Nash claimed in these fields.  To be sure, there will still be authors who write biographies on the "great men" of the American Revolution, but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict.  Thus, Nash is not the lone voice for these "forgotten" as he claimed 
 Good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--"Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.  EDIT: From now on I am never giving a book that I halfway like two stars again because each time, I receive the urge to change my rating to three stars.  Just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three 
 I read it. I finished it. I put it down and didn't speak of it again. Not my style: Too much floof - not enough substance. However, if this is your thing, it's not poorly written 
 Aries Spears is cool, but I guess that I set my expectations too high for this one...I should have bought "I Ain't Scared" instead...I'll be selling this one immediately 
 Not the end of the world but I was dissapointed with the presentation of this book.  A lot of the illustrations seemed dated and were in black and white.   Additionally, the binding of the book doesn't allow the book to be laid down flat.  A spiral binding would really help to bounce from area to area 
 Do NOT buy this PDF if you are a serious professional and want to work for VoIP. You will waste your money buying this and waste your time reading this. I do not think I can give even one star to this book. However Amazon does not accept review if I do not give at least one star hence I have give that rating 
 For a 2-disc, director's cut, my expectations were perhaps too high for this DVD.  Nevertheless, I was appalled at the poor quality of the transfer.  The colors were dull throughout, and focus was frequently not at the beginning of scenes.    For the movie itself, I don't agree that it is holding up well over time.  At 25 years old, the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who aren't waiting for their beloved canceled TV series to be on the big screen.  There's no question that II and IV are the best of the series, but comparing it to other Star Trek original cast movies isn't putting the bar very high.  My interest in watching this again was just having finished Melville's Moby Dick, the final scenes of which Khan repeats liberally during the final space battle.  That said, I think Montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed Khan and very evocative of Ahab.  However, Shatner's pretentious Kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on.  The original cast schtick just doesn't make for a compelling drama 
 Really no amazing!!!!!!!! Un disco mas de early tri-hop .La unica cancion ke vale la pena es Daydreaming...and Hymn of the big wheel el resto aburridiiiiiiiiiiiiiisimo.......ohh Unfinished Symphaty es cool tambien 
 Poorly constructed, unstable when assembled. Wood looks fake. Very disappointin 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 I hate to be the 'dog in the manger' on this one, but I found this book very irritating.  Not so much in that it's a particularly badly written book (it's not), but its incredible popularity is more an indictment of it's fans rather than it's creator.  Mitch Ablom books, in general, and "For One More Day" in particular, are popular for the same reasons McDonalds, Olive Garden, Celine Dion, and Tom Cruise are popular.  They provide a mass audience (baby boomers in particular), with a well-packaged, predictable, easily digestable, intellectually nonthreatening, and utterly mediocre product.  "For One More Day" is tailored to the worst in the whiny, self-absorbed baby boomer generation.  As the boomers age, they greet the almost universal midlife themes of dissapointment and regret as if they were the very first people to ever experience those emotions, and make a huge deal of broadcasting and analyzing their feelings to death.  Who doesn't reach middle age and not feel some regret that they didn't write the Great American Novel, marry the Homecoming Queen/King, or start a fabulously successful dot-com?  I guess with the baby boomers it's a particularly bitter pill because they were brought up from the get-go to believe they were oh-so-SPECIAL.  Mitch Ablom has tapped this rich vein of boomer angst to great success.  His protagonist, 'Chick' Benetto, is a washed-up ball player with a broken marriage and a drinking problem.  In a fit of self-pity, he tries to kill himself and botches that one too.  He meets his dead mom, acknowleges he has been a real poop, and finds redemption.  Cue the string section and loosen the tear ducts.  Oh gag me!!!!  Even some of his 'novel' plot devices are nothing new.  Anyone who has read "An Incident at Owl Creek Bridge" by Ambrose Bierce will be spitting nails at Ablom's shameless cribbing of the books main twist.  The book itself is a childishly easy read.  Ablom is no great artist with the English Language, and no one with greater than a third-grade reading ablily will be taxed by this one.  Faulkner, Eco, and Melville can rest easy.    The baby boom generation has never been known for it's intellectual horsepower, and this book is tailor-made for the Oprah Nation.  A lightweight tome for a lightweight, self-indulgent society 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 I found this book offensive as a pagan.  I have no problem with Wicca as a religion, nor with those that admit it when they plaster other people's gods and goddesses onto Wicca.  What I do have a problem with is when one obviously did enough research on the Norse religion to know that it has very little in common with Wicca, and still claim that the Norse were Wiccan.  Freya and Freyr as the main deities?  Where did that come from?  I guess Odin was too manly to be the principal male in her mind.  The author not only ignored all research done by reconstructionists pagans, but she had to make Freyr, the most effeminate of the Norse gods, the principal male.   This was, unfortunately, the first book on the occult and Norse magic that I read.  Luckily, I actually did some research on the subject, and was able to discard it as useless in under a week.  I will say, however, the book is quite well constructed.  I have ran over it with a truck, left it outside for weeks at a time, used it as a coaster, etc., and the cover hasn't even fallen all the way off yet 
 "Listen, Bunuel. What are we going to do? The witch has quit. Says: too much nudity. Who does she think she is - Mother Theresa?"  "I am a little busy, JP (Quiet, babe! Can't you see? I am talking to my producer here!). Just get another broad for the role: anybody, only with a good front."  "But, Maestro! We'd have to re-shoot half of the movie. Fernando is already talking of another engagement. In any event, with his rate if we use him again, it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick. We might as well scrap the whole thing."  "Don't worry, JP. We'll keep shooting as if nothing happened. That's what being Great Director all about. They are morons, or why you think anyone would pay cash to see such garbage. Most won't even notice that the face is different, and those who do, will find a good explanation for it. Subliminal, surreal, existential, women are alike - all that nonsense, you know. Relax and have a drink." 
 Being a big B.C. fan, I could hardly wait to get my hands on her latest. Unfortunately, there is nothing new, and nothing exciting in this cookbook. There are three recipes for broccoli (yes, 3!), a repeat recipe for roasted cherry tomatoes (as if one recipe wasn't enough??), and a recipe for roasted onion quarters to be served as a side dish (yuck!). These examples were definitely the low-lights for me, but as I flipped through the cookbook, there was nothing that jumped out at me. I was completely underwhelmed. To end on a positive, it is a pretty book 
 Meandering. Monotonous. It is properly mixed and does sound good, though. However, it's a true betrayal of Metallica's namesake.  I often compare and contrast this work with Pantera's underrated (is it still in print?) 1996 album, "The Great Southern Trendkill" and realized the truth: There's no metal here. Even Ministry's "Filth Pig" has more metal than this (and Ministry was all LOADed up on heroin at the time). It may swagger and rock occasionally but that's the problem. It just lacks a punch. I wasn't moved. I was left cold.  Needless to say that I bought this for $5 USD used. And, when I finally listened to it, my conscience led me to that eternal question and a possible answer to that question:  Q: What's the purpose for the existance of 2003's "St. Anger"?  A: To make Metallica's 90s work look damn good by comparison.  Damn shame, really 
 Have two of these printers. Both began creasing the center of paper after a short period of use. Creases got worse and they started to jam. Went to Brother online tech support. Was told to use other paper. Emailed back that I used high quality paper but was told that was the cause. Not so. This seems to be a common problem with this printer and Brother will not acknowledge. Past Brother printers work great. Not sure I will try another Brother 
 I am a seamstress who knows how to sew, and how to thread both top and bobbin threads.  My daughter received this machine for Christmas.  We threaded it according to directions.  It sews about 10 stitches then jams.  I observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing, and leads to a jam every time.  Don't disappoint a child by purchasing this 
 Excellent photos but too much emphasis on the newest boxy glass cubes 
 So for the most part, people have been giving this book good reviews.  My personal opinion is that the book is terrible.  Part of the problem with books of this nature is that historians don't understand biology, and biologists don't understand history.  Kelly's major fault lies in his understanding of plague's biology.  He suggests that the Black Death may have been the reason for the increased frequency of the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion.  He cites an article from 1998.  I doubt he read the article nor anything about the topic further.  In the original journal article (Stephens, et al., [1998], Am. J. Hum. Gen., 62:1507-1515), the Swedes, at 14%, have the highest frequency of the deletion with the Chinese as the lowest.  The Black Death struck China too, so why do so few people have the deletion there?  This same problem plagues (pun very much intended) Scott & Duncan's work (Biology of Plagues, 2001; Return of the World's Greatest Serial Killer, 2005).  What Kelly fails to miss is the abundance of research that shows that Y. pestis doesn't interact with the chemokine receptors, which would have caused the elevation of frequency (the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion confers protection against AIDS).  This is just one of many faults in his presentation of Y. pestis as the causative agent of the Black Death.  He also plagarizes; see p. 25 of his work and p. 24 of Herlihy's The Black Death and the Transformation of the West 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 NATURE UNLEASHED has given us avalanches, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes and now fire.  This is probably the least effective of the series.  The villain is a Michael Myers like creature out for revenge on the park ranger who prevented him from stealing gold from a wornout mine.  The fire scenes are CGI crafted and aren't that impressive; most of the characters are cardboard and not too likeable and "star" Bryan Gennesse chews up the scenery badly.  For firebugs only 
 I love to read, and have all my life.  I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book.  I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it.  I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it.  You'd have to use a microscope to find it.  Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting.  I don't have a problem with that.  My problem is Mary  herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book.  I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.  Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book.  At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something.  In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.  Watch the movie.  Forget the book 
 Lucky Magazine makes me feel Not so Lucky.  It makes me sad that I can not afford all the items they put in their magazine.  One month they tell me round-toed shoes are in and show me 50 pictures of shoes that I would love to own of which 2 I can afford.  Then the following month Lucky tells me round-toed shoes are out and square-toed shoes are in and show me another 50 pictures.  You get the idea?  This magazine is based on trends and you will be broke if you try to keep up and feel bad if you can't afford all the great things it is showing.  I did enjoy Lucky for it's profiles on upcoming designers, some great website links, and the one or two affordable items it does toss in each section.  I also got a few ideas on how to wear clothing in new and different ways.   Most of the time, though, I felt sad and envious after I finished reading it.  These are feelings I'd rather not encounter.  I think I would enjoy it more if it were more informative discussing the quality differences in the items they are showing, maybe testing them out in different situations to help me make the best choice in my purchases.  
 Watched the movie on DVD, loved it so much I immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack.  One of the things I liked about the movie is the juxtaposition of ballroom music and hiphop.  The soundtrack for this movie about ballroom dancing does not have a single track of the ballroom music on it!  What's up with that? 
 i bought this movie after being blown away by the actor/director's masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle.  while it contains similar humor elements and near-anime-type action, it's really not worth the buy, and you would be better served by purchasing Kung Fu Hustle which is much funnier and overall a better production. i probably watch Kung Fu Hustle once every couple of months, which is no small complement 
 I bought this book for the Flower Toggle Hat Pattern, wanting to make it immediately for a gift.  The CO amount doesn't make any sense, but I went ahead with it anyways, thinking that the author is sure to know better than I do.  The completed hat (size 2-3 years) wouldn't fit a cat, let alone my niece.  CO 49 stiches with 22 st/in couldn't posssibly yield a hat to fit 17in. circumference. None of the sizes work out, and I used the recommended yarn, and knitted a gauge swatch.  ANY IDEAS???  Has Ms. Guy put out a correction?  I love the designs, but am not confident to undertake a major project when such an error was found in the first pattern I tried.  I'd still love to make the hat if anyone has the correction.  
 the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 Powell's analysis takes place in an economic vacuum, where all Americans had to do was wait out the four years of economic collapse, and the roaring twenties would have reappeared. The simple truth is that Roosevelt and the New Deal saved capitalism (that out to set off some of you, I'm sure). By 1933, capitalism had fallen into disrepute; only by regulating its excesses, and providing a safety net for its victims, is a part of it in existence today 
 If you want to know how German doctors use herbs as alternatives to pharmaceutical drugs, this is the book for you.  If you are an herbalist, or just want to understand the wonders of medicinal plants, don't bother  with this book.  For example, yarrow, known to be a favorite of herbalists  the world over, is listed with "not recommended" due to lack of  research, even though it has been used for over 3000 years in multiple  cultures, and has over a dozen medicinal therapeutic actions. Save your  money 
 What a magnificently high brow review of the subject of pruning.  If you can understand what these highly educated folks are talking about then you will not need this book.    The wonderfully proper English manner of only indexing by Latin names, colorful use thereof throughout with only minor mention of common names renders this tome utterly useless to the lay gardener.  An advanced degree in botany is required to fully grok what they attempt to convey.  Shun this item.  Wait for a revised version that makes this a useful book vs. the current flogging of hard won degrees 
 I found this book to be unreadable. If most people are like me and hear a little voice in their head as they are reading, the parentheses the author uses in practically every paragraph means a constant interruption of the flow of the idea and presentation. O'Hanlon seems to believe (or maybe assumes) that we are interested (and need to know) in what the heck (hell?) he is thinking (doing, looking, analyzing) every minute as he sails (vacations perhaps?)across the Atlantic. He should just tell me what he wants me to experience; there is no need to suggest alternative thoughts. 
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 William Gaines must be rolling around in his grave. Shame, shame...AVOID THIS 
 There is nothing in the Amazon "book description" that suggests that this is a fundamentalist Christian book.  Nothing wrong with a fundamentalist viewpoint...I just want to know ahead of time if I am buying a book that is as much about leading a Christian life as it is about homeschooling. I expected a book dealing with balancing my life as it pertains to homeschooling versus a book that covers balancing my life solely from a spiritual perspective. For some people, homeschooling and spirituality aren't the exact same thing.  The description and title of the book could have been more forthcoming 
 The writing is very good, but the true and simple test of a novel is to ask oneself these questions:  Do I care about the characters?  Can I stop reading this book right now and never wonder about how it ends?  If you answer no to the first question and yes to the second, it is not a good work of literature.  The Line of Beauty is, unfortunately, one of these novels.  Tedious, overly mannered and stifling 
 I bought this book interested in reading about how people would react in a post-apocalyptic world.  Instead I read a soap opera.  As one reviewer wrote, the first 200 pages are spent introducing the characters and what a boring 200 pages they are.  Unfortunately, it doesn't get much better from there.  Instead of outlining how resourceful some of the characters are in order to survive, the authors are preoccupied with race and sex (more characters than you can believe are more worried about sex than where they are going to get their next meal).  If you would like to read a good post-apocalypse book take a look at Alas, Babylon.  A little dated (cold war) but a much better read than this 
 Carly's book was "ok". She cries alot, triumphs, and blames many around her. This one is definitely skippable 
 I've read all the previous Rita Mae Brown/Sneaky Pie Brown collaberations, so I was excited to see a new one at my local library.  Being a murder mystery fan and cat lover, I've truly enjoyed reading the series.  The best parts are the animals speaking (I love Pewter) and I have a special fondness for Mrs. Murphy because that's who I am (Mrs. Barbara Murphy).  I love Harry, and I don't mind that she's not at the post office anymore.  Her new adventures in grape growing and farming is who she really is--a country girl brought up on a farm.  But I have to say I also forced myself to keep reading this book assuming (hoping) that as I went further, the plot would get better.  I believe it took well over a 100 pages (or maybe it just seemed that long) to get to the "murder".  It also seemed that many of the "regular" characters were missing or barely mentioned especially Miranda, who is a big influence in Harry's life.  I think it was because of the way Ms. Brown went on and on about the biological terrorism, etc--it was like I was reading Time or Newsweek, not a fun, fictional murder mystery.  The winery settings and grape growing were interesting, but some of the conversations that took place between Fair and Harry, or Fair and BoomBoom about the diseases, etc. just didn't seem realistic.  As the story moved along, it did get a little easier to read, but I have to admit, for the first time, it was too obvious who did it and why.  I enjoyed the ending with all of the animals from the barn getting into the mix.  Well, I see another book is coming out early next year.  I'm still looking forward to reading it. 
 I never received the item even though it showed available.  I don't think that should be able to list items they don't really have available 
 Lacking in depth and daring, this book is entirely unexceptional.  Elsewhere one of the readers of Snakes and Ladders cites A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry, now that is a wonderful novel.  It delivers more information, more emotion, more understanding than this little book of magazine-like essays.  I was very disappointed in Snakes and Ladders, thought it a waste of time and money.  Read a Fine Balance, it's glorious 
 Tony Robinson has the skill, through his personality, to convince the viewer of the thoroughness of his research and sincerity. Indeed that is what comes over in this documentary.  Unfortunately when the documentary is closely examined it is not objective. For example Robinson conducts an irrelevant Grail chase and he ridicules Dan Brown's claim that all the art, architecture and secret societies in his book are real. However, Robinson does not prove that any of these are false. It is true that he challenges their significance but that is not the same as proving that Brown was wrong in identifying them.  This documentary lacks the balance that is necessary to make it credible and my impression is that it follows a preconceived notion to present the book as a hoax. Unfortunately Robinson appears to have lost the plot for the book is a work of fiction 
 This book is utterly worthless. I am fed up with McDowell treating Christians as if they were stupid children. This is the final book of his I shall ever read. The "moral truths" which McDowell presents are either one of two things. First, some of them are so incredibly obvious that no person seriously doubts them, and any fool could have figured them out for himself. Or second, they are outdated and anachronistic relics of a past that is best left behind. Reading this book made me think that McDowell belongs somewhere in the mid-1800s rather than on the verge of the 21st Century. Clearly, if his point of view is followed, Christianity will be pulled backward, rather than moved forward 
 What a disappointment to get into this "true story" and discover it is a fictionalized account written on young adult level, with some graphic human and elephant sex thrown in towards the latter part of the book. It is a childish and silly piece of writing. Don't bother with it. It is below standard. However, I did learn that this female Indian elephant had "long glorious tusks" that are (for some reason) totally invisible in her photos 
 This may be "how Mexico really is," but its not a good movie. After reading all the great reviews I was expecting much more. But like 21 Grams, it is just a movie about people you don't really care about because you don't get to know them well enough. You feel like a voyeur on other people's miserable lives and you never get inside their heads enough to really care. Its like watching a sit com, just splashed all over a big screen. There is too much violence without a point. The acting is good but the stories are blah, especially the middle one, and the themes are not developed very well. Its too much "film-making" without anough story. The style doesn't hook into the story and there is very little emotion generated. I simply didn't care, and I would never want to see it again.  Y tu mama tambien is much, much better.

 The prose in this book is so convoluted and each point takes so long to develop that you'll be soon asleep.   What's worse, the book is neither a solid academic overview of the field nor is it a useful handbook for the practitioner.    Rossi and his co-authors make many attempts to give us the grand theoretical frameworks but they quickly get lost in qualifying themselves into a tepid soup in which nothing is ever black or white, hot or cold, true or false.     Although there are some capsule summaries and references to real programmes, these callouts are helpful only to break the tedium.  They are not presented in sufficient detail that normal people could ever learn from them.  There is never any clear instruction about how one should begin an evaluation or how one should proceed.    Possibly this book is useful for an intermediate-to-advanced evaluation practitioner who is interested in comparing his broad generalizations with Rossi's.   
 This neglects to connect the image of Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness, (in Genesis) with the concept that the Woman in Revelation 12 may represent the religion of Muhammad that sprang from the Ishmaelites. In one the earth brings forth water, in the other, it takes it in. Moreover, the twelve stars of her crown have been interpreted as the 12 Imams of the Shí'ih, the sun with which she is clothed, the kingdom of Persia, where her Child, the Promised Qa'im of the House of Muhammad arose in 1844, which is 1260 AH. The wilderness is Arabia, where the Point of Adoration was moved from Jerusalem (and has been moved again). The moon is the Ottoman Sultanate.  The Climax of the conflict is when the Dragon, representing the names of the Umayyad Caliphs, who were always trying to kill the descendants of the Prophet, is defeated by "Archangel Michael" who is believed by Baha'is to be Bahá'u'lláh, the Prophetic Founder. The seven heads are the dominions they ruled. So the time, place and lineage of the Promised One is foretold, but far be it for most Christians to accept His Holiness Muhammad, let alone the Messiah of Islam. 
 Having read the feedback from those people who reviewed the Ivor's book and who gave the book an excellent grade prompted me to buy this book, which I find ridicule since it does not teach you anything about Visual C++ programing.  Even though the book does provide an antiquated amount of old C++, it does not bring the essence that makes Visual Studio 2005, The Apollo Toy, which provides an infinitesimal amount of programing.  Save you money and buy Deitel instead.  Deitel's book does give you a great jump start to Visual Studio 2005.  I do not know if to dump Ivor's in the garbage or else 
 It's good the author updated her book, which was pretty old ...( It came out before I was even legal!), but I don't think it's very good. So it's one of those A to Z books. Tells you about everything, but not how to do it 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 I loved Plantation and Sullivan's Island but I could hardly finish this book. This was not up to her usual writing. I agree with the other reviewer I had to keep going back to reread parts. Bottom line for me this book was boring boring boring. So disappointed in this one. Trying to decide if I want to try Pawley's Island. 
 I love Sidney Sheldon's books, but I was quite disappointed with this one.  I can't believe it got such good reviews.  The story was fast-paced, interesting, and well written.  However, the ending was awful and frustrating.  It was too abrupt and too many things happened at once, it didn't resolve well.  It was also too much of a let down.  There are definitely better Sidney Sheldon books than this one 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 THE ALIENIST is hampered - in this reviewer's opinion, ruined entirely - by Caleb Carr's truly dreadful writing. His obvious desire to write a page-turner is frustrated almost at once by an absurdly convoluted narrative style. This, I suppose, was adopted with the idea of lending the text, a serial murder mystery set in 1890s New York, a properly tortuous Victorian tone. Unfortunately, that authenticity is otherwise little in evidence. The key players, besides speaking in wholly indistinguishable voices, are essentially modern figures thrown against period sets and dressed in period clothing. The narrator's discourse, though undoubtedly possessing a Victorian profusion of uninteresting and unnecessary detail, is disfigured everywhere with contractions and parentheses. The most anachronistic point, however, is certainly the discussion and description of the malefactor's crimes within the narrative; these passages are written with a gusto and a casualness that the average citizen of the period would have blushed at. They are purely, ludicrously modern. And Carr's difficulties, sadly, don't end there. He evidently could not decide how the narrator ought to refer to the title character, and so alternates the man's first and last name in an irritating fashion. The writing style as a whole is absurdly uneven, now careful and precise, now expansive and rambling, now simply vague and unclear. Finally and most irksome of all, Carr has a habit of concluding nearly every paragraph with statements such as "But we little thought how dangerous this revelation would  prove!" - ingeniously knocking out any suspense in a text already too awkward to contain much.  I will admit that I wanted to know the ending, and thought that the story might have been interesting in less inept hands, but as I am a confirmed detective-fiction junkie, I hardly think those are ameliorating circumstances. Altogether, I thought it a shoddy piece of work with little to recommend it beyond the grotesqueries of the crimes involved 
 the irritating writing style continues...unfortunately this time there is no attempt at a storyline and no interesting characters. we don't really need to be informed every time someone has to 'connect to the force', or runs through jedi meditation techniques, etc. it has to be implied at some point really 
 I'm sure that somewhere in this book there is a story, but it wasn't worth the cost of finding it.  Started reading this and got 100 pages into it before saying enough with all the obscure references, historical meanderings, and pointless speculations.  Seems like this book's real purpose is to test the reader's intellectual bona fides rather than to present a well written, intriguing story.  It was a slog and people who want to give it great ratings, I think, do so because they're afraid people will think them stupid if they tell the truth.  Call me stupid then, but this book needed a good editor and someone to tell this pretentious author to move the story along once in a while and lighten up on the obscure/pointless ramblings. My congratulations to those who managed to get to the end of this 533 page snooze fest.  You have my admiration for your tenacity.  I note that people usually rate one or two star reviews as unhelpful.  But take a look at lots of reviews of this book.  The majority of them say it is a long, boring slog, then they give it a 3 star rating.  How helpful is that?  
 This is very expensive for what is essentially hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. which would cost the average person about 3 dollars. 
 There is certainly a need for secondary literature to describe a complex standard such as the CMMI. This book does a reasonable job to accomplish this. As it has been stated there are certainly weaknesses. For example the ratio between actual content and number of pages is in some areas pretty bad. One citation an the start of a chapter is nice, two is an over load. In order to gain a fair understanding of the CMMI standard is not sufficient and neither is this book. However, "CMMI Distilled" gets you a step closer 
 To call this year's edition of Best American Poetry a triumph of mediocrity would be sufficiently charitable an act to count as one, perhaps two, of the three miracles required for sainthood.  It is, in fact, a triumph of badness: in evidence here is bland, tepid, listless language; strained and ultimately fruitless attempts at humor; clarity at the expense of vision, imagination, rich language, innovation.  Do not be fooled into thinking this anthology contains poems constituting any sort of "survey course" in modern poetry; it is, instead, made up of that particular brand of poetry, poetry-by-friends, which one man in a position of authority in the poetry community (David Lehman) happens to enjoy, and in this he is at odds with most of his contemporaries--for whom how well you write is substantially more important than who you know, who you've studied under, and where you live (cf. New York City).  This anthology casts a shockingly short net in a remarkably deep ocean of literary talent.  If you're looking to tune into what's happening now in the world of poetry, buy any book by Joshua Beckman, Sarah Manguso, Rachel Zucker, or Dean Young (some of whom have appeared in the BAP series, but never represented by their best work, and only intermittently, at that).  Or re-visit the best work of some masters (for whom the same caveat applies): Gerald Stern, Jorie Graham, and especially Franz Wright.  Don't squander even a penny on this insipid and uninspired garbage--everything here is either the wrong poem by the right poet or the wrong poem by a poet with the right connections 
 As a child born to the same type of immigrants she bewails in her book, Malkin is a quivering mass of hypocrisy.  She and Annie Coulter would make a great couple 
 There are much better books on buttrerfly gardening out there than this one - I recommend Butterfly Gardening by the Xerces Society.  Its got not only the plants that butterflies like but also the lifecycle of butterflies.  Creating A Butterfly Garden is like the hummingbird gardening book by the same author - very very basic with listings of plants and drawings of gardens but little more. You can get what's offered in these books off the internet.  I ended up spending a little more to get a decent book that got me further below the surface and have a great butterfly garden going - variety is the key.  The more kinds of flowers, the more kinds of butterflies.  Its important to recognize that to have butterflies you need to have caterpillars too and they are fun to provide for and watch develop as wel 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 This book is not for bookkeepers.  It is more for accountants who want to understand non-profit accounting.  If a bookkeeper needs to know the proper day to day and month to month entries for this kind of organization, than this book is not for you. However, if you are an accountant, you may be able to glean good information about the basic philosophy of non-profit organizations, such as account set-up and reporting 
 This record is not Robben Ford at his best, uninspired playing and singing and the lyrics are really at a low level, not a good record at all. 
 This is disgusting trash.  You people have really lost all moral decency.  The person you wrote this should be locked up - forever.  
 I usually like this kind of stuff by ECM. But this is very bland and very very boring. Avoid 
 I bought this cd thinking the music from the movie was going to be on it.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Don't bother getting this cd, its not even worthed.  I wasted major money and Amazon should've had the songs on preview, but they didn't help either.  A Shame 
 It has nothing but pre-published photos we have all seen before in magazines. The tats aren't even shown. They talk about how Angelina has a lot of them but they don't even list them all. Not made for the true tattoo enthusist. A coffee table book at best. It describes their crazy childhoods more than the tats 
 ............and follow me here, this movie is terrible. No matter what the other people tell you, I am telling you the truth and this is my business. If you are going to buy this film, and "pretend" it's a Bond film, you are better off getting "The Thomas Crown Affair." This movie is so over acted that it is ridiculous, though, in reverse of the last three Bond outings, it starts off silly and gets a little better. It proves that playing 007 has been good for Pierce. He has gained confidence through that role that has served him well in his films about love or jewel thieves. He didn't have it here, bless his heart. My girlfriend likes to think that it's him in the love scenes and not a body double. She said,"Oh, so that's what Bond looks like making love........."  Pass on this one lads, trust me 
 Silvey's book gives lots of wonderful books, lots and lots of books, but little concept of why (on an objective standard) she chose these books.  For example why choose Roald Dahl's BFG rather than his more renowned CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY? Why did she exclude WHOSE MOUSE AM I, the MISS PICKERELL books, ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN?  Where are the Scott Corbett, Bruce Coville, and Jay Williams classics? How can one compile a "Best" list of children's books without HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS or any Judy Blume book?  Very few books on her list come from African-American (bell hooks, Irene Smalls), Asian American (Taro Yashima), or Latino American (Harriet Rohmer) authors.  Hopefully when she updates this book she will make it more multi-cultural, historically respectful, and more objectively evaluated.  Should you buy it? Absolutely! It possesses some EXCELLENT books, but you should not make it your only book of this type 
 One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun.  Quite the reverse.  He has cut it in half.  The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either.  Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half.  Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes  Even the plot is tissue-thin.  The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring.  Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction.  As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one.  He is capable of far better.  
 Kids will like... for as long as it lasts. And it won't last long. I also found the way the basket attaches to the wheel base to become a cart annoying. The darn thing falls off all the time and eventually I threw it out. It just frustrated the kids at church nursery. Better off seeking a sturdier option. Even for a household with jsut one kid -- this thing is flimsy. It def. won't work for a situation where many kids will be using it (church nursery, preschool, etc. 
 interesting enough, lance loves to blather on about how its important that one cannot get absorbed in himself, but rather be about the team. i quote lance "if you aren't thinking 'team,' you got left home." ok, sounds alright. then i flip a page and read further: [floyd landis got second place in a race]..."I patted myself on the back for being smart enough to recognize how good he was before he saw it for himself..." ok lance, we get the point, you're awesome at everything, including being 'smart.' but you don't quite understand the 'team' concep 
  Miniter takes advantage of the American ideological divide by cashing in with controversal editorials of hyperbole.   Maybe he could get together for a book with Ann Coulter 
 Other than as a motivational work (and there, only nominally) this is not an effective financial reference nor does it contain any new ideas. The repetition (word for word in some cases) throughout led me to wonder if the author cut and pasted from a bank of passages that he had written.  The gist of the author's message is to find an aptitude or interest that one has and use it as a career basis to increase income. In other words, it's a world full of "rock stars" and all one must do is pick up their proverbial guitar 
 I read the reviews here about this book and loves mysteries. This one is a total bore

 Whatever his fellow Irish intellectual colleagues may indicate on the book cover to the contrary, Diaramid  Ferriter's,  The Transformation of Ireland, is not a readable book. Its length is long, its chapters, paragraphs, sentences, and words likewise. Diaramid has not a simple seven-word sentence in him.   It was once said that Catholicism is what everyone, everywhere at all times always believed. The contribution of its Catholic heritage to Irish character seems to be that every Irishman is always wrong about every thing at all times and every Irishman knows exactly what is wrong about what every other Irishman is saying. It is this inalienable right to be disagreeable, contentious and argumentative that Diarmid pitilessly chronicles in his encyclopedic book: an infinite panorama of discord. One is grateful that, indeed, time runs in one direction only for its spares us learning how, for example, de Valera would have disagreed with contemporary Irish feminists. All other generational, intra-generational and intergenerational disagreements are fair game for inclusion in The Transformation of Ireland   Howsoever the British may have tyrannized the Irish people, one cannot but observe that the Irish, in learning their language and publishing books such as this, have extracted some fit measure of revenge upon the people who spake the tongue that Shakespeare spake. Diaramid, according to the book-cover, is a "lecturer" at Dublin University. That's an understatement. To his credit, it can be said that judging from the numbing comprehensiveness of this book, he works hard at it. Puts me in mind of Hubert Humphrey, of whom Lyndon Johnson said, "Hubert prepares for delivering a 2-hour speech by taking a deep breath."   An occasional reference to the population of Ireland, somewhere around 3.5 million people, gives me cause to ponder. That is about the population of metropolitan Boston. How could so few people make so much fuss as has Ireland in the 20th century? Two salient facts provide a clue. One is that for most the 20th century the Irish were staggeringly unexposed to education. And second (and related) Ferriter notes Ireland's lack of any liberal humanistic tradition, such as played a role in most other European nations. Consider for a second, "Irish contributions to science." Can you think of one?                     
 I was in a hurry when I chose this book, now I wish I'd spent a little more time flipping through it. Each section begins with dialogue between Matty and the people/dogs he is working with. That part is completely pointless, and not even entertaining to me. Finally I realized I could skip half of each chapter to get to the meat. Still though, there is pointless ad-libbing through the actually instructions! By skipping, it only took me 45 minutes to get through this book. If you can manage that, there is some usefull advice. However, for such a thick book, I was very surprised that it only covered basic commands. I am still a little confused about how to train my dog! Definately not worthy of "The Ultimate Guide.." title 
 I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  : 
 I have found this cookbook to be both unspiring and a little misleading.  None of the recipes are really that appealing or all that wonderful.  They are okay, but nothing too fancy.  Often the quick and dirty process of this cookbook involves you using a lot of canned, frozen, or pre-fabbed ingredients, which hinders the taste of the finished product.  There are only a few recipes in the book that really pique my taste buds--everything else is either just average or far below average.  A talented cook can probably enhance the recipes with a little spices, fresh vegetables, and a little creativity, but then it misses the point of getting your meals done in 30 minutes or less.  That brings me on to the next point.  The whole concept of having dinner in 30 minutes or less is misleading.  Most of the recipes in this book are not main dishes, but instead side dishes.  To fill you up or to have a balanced meal, you'd most likely have to cook 2-3 of these dishes, thereby resulting in a meal that takes a lot longer than 20-30 minutes to cook.  I was able to get this book on clearance at Sam's Club for dirt cheap.  I also collect cookbooks, so buying this wasn't so draining on my finances.  However, unless you're either a hobbyist that likes to have a variety of cookbooks or if you can find this book for dirt cheap like I did, I can't justify spending the money for this book.  There is really nothing exciting here 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 The reason for the low rating is the lack of any subtitles on the boxset and Amazon's mistake in the product description. Folks, all seasons of this series are shipped in DVDs with no subtitles and no closed-caption. 
 I only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so I returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7+ hours of run time per charge.  
 This software didn't quite do what I expected.  I was somewhat disappointed when I discovered that it wouldn't convert iTunes m4p music files to MP3 files to run on a REAL Player.  
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 I received wrong item, but there was no service after that 
 This has gone too far. This is not science. This is not theology.  This is secularsciencism brainwashing forcing Scripture as reinterpreted to agree with its worldly-darwinistic conclusions and theories from godless theory-spinners like Carl Sagan, Edwin Hubble,Stephen Hawking, and earthly-wisdom educated astrophysicists.  It is a travesty when astrophysics presumes to tell the Bible what it means. Rather, the Word of God tells astrophysics to submit itself to 6 normal calendar earth-rotation days as the Genesis Workweek of the Lord as Moses understood. If Moses didn't have a PhD in astrophysics when writing Genesis and believed in a Sunday-Friday literal creation yoms of 24 hrs, then of course that's what the Bible's original intent and meaning today is.   reviewed by Juliet W. Larsen, apologist

 This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead.. 
 I make no bones about it: "Faust" is the one drama that outdoes Shakespeare in scope, impact, the kind of complexity that makes one THINK about what one is reading (or viewing, on the rare occasions that the play is staged). So why the brutal abridgement by Kaufmann? "Faust" deserves a completely uncut translation, and if we're lucky enough, uncut staging. So much is missing in this version that it just becomes a mutilated torso. If you want really to experience this Mount Everest of dramas, learn German and read something like the Hamburger Ausgabe (Hamburg Edition). And if you're lucky, see it staged 
 I wish I could have read the reviews here before buying this book. I bought it while at the airport because the description on the back sounded interesting. It isn't the page turner that it could have been.   The beginning is great and the gets you hooked, but it's pretty much what's on the back cover that got you to buy the book. Even from the beginning, Edward's prose is annoying, she describes things for no reason and it feels like she's wasting our time, trying to draw out the storyline.   Once the main event is over, the plot goes nowhere and it's incredibly boring. I started flipping past paragraphs of irrelevant descriptions.   I didn't think the ending was surprising at all. You know it's going to happen, you're wondering why Edwards takes so long to get to it. I did think it was touching and, fine, I admit it, it made me cry... but in my defense, I cry at everything (even that depression commercial chokes me up - Where does depression hurt? Everywhere. Who does depression hurt? Everyone.)    All in all, this book seemed interesting, but I wish I had chosen another (better written) book to read.

 I purchased this book with the intention of reading gritty tales of growing up in the South, not lesbian porn.  I do not have a problem with Ms. Allison's sexual preference; some of what she had to say about being a lesbian was interesting.  However, I found this book to be pornographic and disgusting.  I did not realize that 80% of this book was detailed sexual encounters.  For example, one story describes her partner urinating on her face. I do not recommend this book 
 It took a long time before any action to acumulate in Larry Watson's novel. I resented spending two hours of my time reading this book beacuse the novel could have conveyed the same message in 50 pages. I felt the writing was very simplistic contrary to other novels on family relationships and moral dilemas. A very easy read, avoid if possible 
 i bought this album because "boys of summer" got stuck in my head. i thought itd be something new and fresh. i struck out there. after the first song everything sounds repetitive. i got bored by song 4, since i somewhat enjoyed "in this diary". i wanted to enjoy it, i really did, but it just seemed so recycled. every song seemed to try and make teenage girls cry. im not a girl but the only time i contemplated crying was when i realized i couldnt get my 15$ back. sure it sounds a bit different from the run-of-the-mill stuff we're getting today, but not by enough. every verse and chorus could be played over one riff, its that identical. im all for a band keeping with its style, but that doesnt mean the style has to be narrowed down and boring. i wouldn't recommend this to many people. sorry, its just wea

 a friend of mine recommended this book a while ago and i decided to give it a try. what a waste of time! after a so-so start it dissolves into a silly, improbable, absolutely unbelievable mess, the conclusion being particularly stupid  and unrealistic. if you want to do yourself a favour, stay with patricia highsmith instead 
 I own the 2001 edition, which is awkwardly written, very poorly edited, and difficult to use as a reference.  Many photos appear to be xeroxes of movements rather than photos, and are illegible.  Many actual photos are of such poor quality as to be essentially useless. There is no index, no attempt to provide cross-reference material (such as calibres common to a set of watches).  Even the table of contents contains an error.  This book often gives the appearence of being thrown together solely as a vehicle for the many advertisements from various watch sellers that appear within it.  A much better method of pricing watches - more accurate, colorful and more up-to-date - would be to look at auction catalogs.    Not recommended 
 I was really hopeful about this diaper bag when I ordered it through Amazon.  The size is small and convenient, but I found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck.  Also, the clasp broke after I had it for only 2 weeks!  I am really disappointed, and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag.   
 Most of Stephin Merrit's work to this point has been backed to very catchy, tightly cohesive tunes, with simple and easy-to-remember synth-pop tunes.  This album is a departure from that trend... Much like the Magnetic Fields' album "Distant Plastic Trees", the lyrics are layered over a background that sounds like the inside of a wet cave, yet somehow reminds one of the Jetsons cartoon as well.  In that respect, this CD was a stunning improvement on what started in "Distant Plastic Trees."  It is pretty good, but not in the direction I wanted to go.  You served me Italian when I wanted Mexican... 
 It probably seemed like a good idea in retrospect. Elvis wanted to go to Nashville and meet with an icon of a country classic producer, then cut an album of some of his favorites right there in music city. And after cutting some of the best singles in a country format (Radio Sweetheart being one), it really could have been a great record.  Instead, it was Elvis' first big misstep of his stellar career. He failed to understand the hack mentality of the Nashville scene, and "Almost Blue" is the sound of a 9 to 5 producer (Billy Sherrill) trying to shoehorn a band of randy brits into a paint by numbers sound. While the album kicks off like it should ("Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To?"), the ensuing album finds the band in a straightjacket. The sole exceptions, naturally, were the ballads. ("Good Year for The Roses," "Brown to Blue" and "How Much I Lied.") The rest of "Almost Blue" then struggles to get out from under the limitations. It left Elvis and the Attractions, who had spent those first three albums exposing themselves as a volatile, high energy creative force, suddenly blanded into cookie cutter recordings robbed of an album worth hearing more than as a vanity project.  The bonus disc has live material, and it is at least proof that EC's love of country music isn't a facade. In fact, the bonus disc of "Kojak Variety" is a better country record than "Almost Blue." Consider that a recommendation for "Varieties." 
 I have read many ...for Dummies books and bought the All in One for Excel, Access and FP2003 together. The FP2003 stood out as by far the weakest of the three.  It gives short thrift to the mechanics of using the software and quickly drifts into programming techniques to avoid explaining how the software works. I bought the book to understand and use the many features of FP2003. I was disappointed.  A waste of my money, and no doubt, a waste of yours 
 Miserable and frustrating. I wasted an entire weekend trying to learn from this book. I seriously think they outsourced the actual coding in the CD, because there are so many ridiculous inconsistencies.  For one thing, the in-book code samples and example(from CD) code samples are completely different. The example code is written in a bizarre style that overuses uses spaces and parentheses in a way not used by the book and generally atypical to American code. There's also a number of devastating errors with both the book AND CD which made this a frustrating learning experience:  - Book code for a basic Windows program has error that causes program to not close properly. (have to ctrl-alt-delete) CD code for this actually works, but it's uncommented and very ugly. - CD code for the entire third chapter does not execute. It compiles, but it doesn't run. - CD code has this dxManager structure that is simply not explained. - Book doesn't tell you that you need to add .lib files until far too late. Sometimes it doesn't tell you what .lib files you need to add at all. - No VC++ 6.0 project/workspace files are provided. This is sheer laziness...it'd take them 10 minutes to add these.  I spent my whole weekend trying to use their base code, then trying to use the DirectX SDK's base code, then experimenting until I finally figured out a way to get their ransom-note HELLO WORLD program to work. I wasted an entire weekend on this. I had to hollow out chapter 4 example 1 code and plug in the chapter 3 example 3 code in to work with it. I've never had this much difficulty coding in my life.  Waste of time, waste of money. Find something else 
 Reading other reviewers' positive words on this page, you would never know that Rose's book is riddled with errors of fact, despite her almost total dependence on secondary sources.  But a discerning reader might wonder at the facile slippage between person and movement (as she does with the life and family of Theodor Herzl in her psychoanalytical outlook) or at the extrapolation of a full blown theory from interviews with a few fanatic settlers.  How she manages to get Shabtai Zvi as the remote founder of her version of 'apocalyptic' Zionism (oops, messianism) is likewise unconvincing.  Rose is a talented professor of English; she should stick to her last 
 This book exposes nothing.  There are way-better books out there, better written and better researched.  I bought it after watching her much needed bashing of these retarded Neo-Cons on Bill Maher's show.  Here's the lowdown:  She grabs one subject and repeats it dozens of different ways, adding new twists, puns and jokes.  The book has no cohesive structure.  Like an ADD-sufferer on coffee. Worst of all, she was part of that system.  She gets divorced, and boom.  Her politics take a 180 degree turn.  How's that supposed to work?  If the payoffs from these interest groups are providing for your cushy life, it's good.  But if you divorce your Neo-Con husband, then, all of a sudden it's bad.  Honestly, I see a lack of integrity here.  So, if tomorrow she marries a communist, will she be singing Lenin's praises?  Or how about a devil-worshiper?  Will she go satanic? Then, I watched her devolve on Maher's show, constantly doing nothing but vent her anger at her ex-husband in a thin veil of politics.  She ran for Cali governor and her points were high.  Then, she started opening her mouth, and her points plumetted.  For good reason.  Because she ran a negative campaign against the Governator. (Which is exactly the same thing she acuses Neo-Cons of doing in this worthless book). But, of course, knee-jerk liberals love her, because they see her as a repented sinner who sees the error of her ways.  LET ME SUM UP THE BOOK FOR YOU:  A party holds on to power too long, it becomes corrupt.  Campaign reform is needed.  End of story 
 This audio book would be much better read than listened to. There are certain areas that you will not be interested in, and some areas you'll want to read over and over again 
 Ms. Estefan sings a collection of oldies here, and NONE of them have anything unique to offer in the way of clever arrangements or an individual point of view. "Cherchez La Femme", the great song originally recorded by Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, is virtually identical, minus the pizzaz and sass. It is transformed into a bland vehicle for Estefan. Ditto "Turn The Beat Around". What is the point of copying the original musical and vocal arrangements so closely that it renders the remake utterly pointless? Why listen to these cheezy remakes when the originals are the real deal? Keep these questions in mind, and before you invest in this hollow exercise, seek out the originals, and leave this empty collection alone 
 Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film 
 Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be.    I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like this book, reasonably, I thought.  Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. Well, I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. The last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.  OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time.   I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. It was very tedious to finish but I made it to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books 
 i definitely agree with the other comment that it's all about window coverings. interior design is not all about window treatments and trying to sell products to your clients. interior design is about designing the homes of your clients. definitely a misleading book 
 I opened up this book a few weekends ago for the upcoming test.  I was really disappointed in that there were only 2 or 3 questions per chapter!  It did not seem like enough for such a LARGE & expensive book (500+ pp).  I was also told by my colleages that the questions do not mirror what you will encounter during the PE exam, so I really don't know how useful it will be to go through the sample problems when they won't prepare you for the exam.  I suppose that is why it is titled, "Sample Problems" and NOT "Sample Exam Problems."  Skip this book and just get the ones geared towards giving you sample examination problems 
 "The Curse of the Golden Flower" while offering striking scenes of epic proportion akin to any multi-million dollar venture offers little more than conspicuous consumption. There are dramatic scenes illuminated in gold, flowers and such...seemingly like an olympic prelude. This movie lacks sufficient character development, such as Yimou's other ventures such as "the road home," "hero" "house of flying daggers" "raise the red lantern" and "to live." Those movies captivating in both cinematography, character and emotion. It strikes a chord in the soul upon watching these films. However, I was highly disappointed in this venture because the characters were not drawn out. Gong Li's character, Chow Yun's character and such were not really full people that I cared about. Jay Chou's character is probably the most believable, however none of the plot seems to amount to much even with all the shimmering glam and low cut europeanized outfits the women wear. It does not appear to even be the Tang Dynasty, the culturally rich dynasty in Chinese history. The costuming, including the armor looks alien, appearing to be more Victorian era than Tang Dynasty and detracts from the film. Though it was effective in highlighting the extent of corruption, it fell so far short of Zhang Yimou's ability. I felt as if that hour and 45 minutes lay wasted before me in the strange decadence of the film. There is no particular dialoug or scene that sticks out in my conscious and I was not moved by any aspect of this vastly empty film. Maybe I expect to much from such a brilliant filmmaker and writer, but I cannot understand why such a film was even made, why so much money was wasted and why Zhang Yimou or Gong Li, Chow Yun Fat or Jay Chou would attach their names to such a waste of time 
 Rather disappointed. Only a few real usefull hints, some obvious "secrets", very disorganized, no logic structure.  I will be more careful selecting my next purchase espacially as I had to pay 10 Euro on top for the customs.. 
 The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.   Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.   Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.   Jesus wept.   And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.   At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually 
 This item works great when it works.  I purchase this item and the Bluetooth transmitted ceased functioning in less than 30 days.  The company which I purchased it from replaced the unit and the new one stoppped functioning fot he same reason about 90 days later.  Akronics, the vendor, will not even answer emails.  Holux, who has a 0ne year warranty on these devices, does not respond to emails to its service center.  From what I have been able to find out is that the Bluetooth problem is a common occurance and the unit is temperature sensative.  This is odd in that it is a mobile unit intended for the car and dashboard positioning.  So if you want to throw away your money buy Holux or learn from my mistake.  
 "A startling piece of detective work," says the Amazon book description, "that combines history, literary criticism, esoterica and archaeology, Genesis of the Grail Kings is the ultimate story of earthly kingship from its Mesopotamian foundation."    Well, yeah, sort of.   I have been expanding my mind with crackpot literature for many years and I must say that this is as fine an example of such bilge as I have ever seen. It starts off with a bang, being forwarded by "HRH [no less!] Prince Nicholas de Vere KGC, KCD / Princeps Draconis, Sovereign Grand Master / and Magister Templi of Sarkany Bend / The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court and Order".  Well, I'm impressed.  Sure I am.  Although I can only wonder why HRH has not also taken on the duties of Master of the Buckhounds, Groom of the Back Stairs, Archbishop of Titipu, and Lord Mayor, both acting and elect.    Gardner casts a wide net.  He offers aliens from outer space who may or may not have originated on a Kuiper Belt object with an orbital period of 360 (or perhaps 3600) years and who may have interfered with human evolution in some not quite specified way about 6,000 years ago to create--ta-dah!--Adam and Eve.  These aliens, of course, were the immortal gods of the earliest Mesopotamians who have ... well ... died out, leaving behind a line of alien/divinely appointed kings to reign over nothing much down to this very day.  I'm not making this up, you know!  Gardener also offers a revised history of the text of the Bible which, among other things, proves pretty conclusively that God did not dictate it to King James after all.    Gardener is also very big on offering the TRUTH.  Since the TRUTH is radically inconsistent with the writings of a couple of millenniums of historians and four centuries of post-Renaissance scholarship, Gardener politely corrects them all.    And he throws in other goodies, too.  Consider this passage from page 204 of the paperback edition: "Another feature of the white powder [the Philosopher's Stone] is that even its 56 per cent substance (that is the sample excluding the 44 per cent light content) can be made to disappear completely from sight, moving itself into another dimension. At that stage of experimentation (which, incidentally, can be wholly reversed) not only does the invisible substance weigh less than nothing but the pan in which it was  sitting also registers less than its zero point starting weight.  This particular aspect of the fire stone's has some stunning consequences, as will be discovered when the latter stages of our investigation move into the anti-gravitational sciences of  ancient Egypt."  Now, THAT's what I call top of the line woo-woo!  (An opinion which, incidentally, cannot be reversed at all.)  As book-length ravings go, this one is actually rather entertaining.  It contains a considerable amount of information, both accurate and new.    The accurate information includes details about the development of the currently accepted text of the Bible and the contents of a substantial number of cuneiform inscriptions from Mesopotamia.  A hundred and fifty years ago, when this was first published by hard-headed, sharp-eyed scholars, mostly of the German persuasion who were known as the higher critics, it was hot news.    Gardener's new gems of information, the experiments disproving the universal attraction of gravity, the long, long genealogies largely supported by moonstruck etymology, the literal truth of the venerable ages of the Biblical patriarchs and the even longer-lived antediluvian kings of Sumer, the oddly incompetent god-aliens from space, the endless riffs about the nature of myths and historical research, they are all woo-woo.  Just plain, sweet woo-woo masquerading as something useful 
 What we have here is a leftist author who believes the way to fix all racial problems is for everybody to accept his policy prescriptions.  He thinks white conservative Christians, although showing little racial animus toward blacks, are "part of the problem" because they don't accept his particular political views.  This bias taints any insightful parts of the book 
 Cannot remember a reading a worse book.  Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue.  The only good think about it is that it is very short 
 I turned to this book hoping to find help in theorizing the biographical narrative I use as an education researcher.   In an attempt to establish their research stance as viable, the authors attack both quantitative and formalist (e.g., deconstruction and post-stucturalist) positions.  To do this, they take what is in reality a wide array of theorists and tools and lump them together, making huge generalizations and managing to misrepresent these other traditions in dramatic ways.  My goal in writing this is not to defend these other positions, but to suggest that when we try to establish our own validity through straw men, we most often end up weakening our own position.  Unless we are going to assume that our colleagues are stupid or evil for taking research and epistemological stances different than our own, it seems more realistic and useful to assume that we have room for a wide variety of tools and that a given tool will work well in some situations and more poorly in others.  In the wake of the real threats posed to progressive practice and qualitative research from the National Reading Panel and No Child Left Behind, I find myself now seeking allies among quantitative researchers and I am better served trying to understand how we can work together.  This book would have been more useful if the authors had spent more time defining and redefining their own position and less time attacking others.  As it is, it is undertheorized and overwrought 
 I'm a huge PE fan from back in 1987 when I got "Yo! Bum Rush The Show!" and of course Takes A Nation is the best rap album of all time, bar none. But man does Chuck D come across like an idiot here. Let me give you the chapter breakdown: 1: It's the white man's fault. 2. Damn crackers own the music business. 3 White man rules the world. 4. Santa Claus is a big fat Caucasian. 5. The Western world has hyped the AIDS numbers in Africa for "their own devious purposes." 6. It's the white man's fault. That AIDS quote is real, by the way. It's full of this kind of talk, and that's fine. He's entitled to his opinion, and white people have indeed done some pretty awful things to minorites over the centuries. But how about a few solutions, rather than his "I have put together a proposal for the US government about slavery, a payment of four trillion, two hundred billion dollars." We get your point, Chuck, but let's be realistic and offer some real world solutions. White guys may be the majority of sports agents, Hollywood execs, and corporate CEOs, yes. Do they screw over their artists? Sure--but they screw over both black and white artists in royalties and residuals--just ask that guy who played Batman on TV in the 60's/70's. In fairness, there are some cool bits about Africa, gangs, and other rappers. The best part is his stories about touring with U2. But I was hoping Chuck D would give us some solutions, rather than just a big vent/therapy session. White people rule the US? Maybe. Deal with it, and bring yourself up to their level. Peace--and go get a late pass 
 This small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover. Yet, I find it unsatisfactory. It meanders in and out of the history of Islam and the Middle East, but loses focus on the way. Subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation, but not really in depth. It is obvious, however, that Lewis knows quite a lot - but still some clear mistakes (or misformulations?) in chronology and factual events mar the picture, and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled. It has some really interesting insights in how the USA became the great enemy of the Islamists, and many details that makes the Middle East history much more detailed than it usually appears. Yet, in walking there and there, it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of Serge Trifkovic, for example. And while Trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the Islamist threat, Lewis merely mentions the threat, but then walks on to something else. And he doesn't really connect the issues of Holy War and Unholy Terror in depth as promised in the subtitle.  Bottom line: While interesting, I suggest to spend time and money on better books. They are out there 
 I found this book to be very boring. I bought it because I had seen it referanced in a lot of magazine articles. It may be good for looking up useful information on heart disease, but not really a preventative book. The diet recommended in this book is unrealistic to me and seems like a diet that would be recommended to a person who was diagnosed with heart disease and had to change their lifestyle 
 Do not be decieved by this book.  If you're new to the sport of Judo, this book will provide an intelligent approach to the effectivness of Judo. However, if you have had a few lessons and have a High-School understanding  of Physics, then there is nothiung in this book that you wouldn't be able  to figure out on your own.  This book suffers from a lack of sufficient  visual aids and is often confusing when it attepts to break the concepts of  Judo down to mathematical calculations.  Overall, this book would be nice  to add to your Judo library... But it is not an essential 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 While this wasn't the worse film that I have ever seen it comes close.  This had the potential to be a really awesome and dramatic story, but it turns out to be slightly more interesting than watching paint dry 
 Sure! The same tripe that has suckered people in for ages - its all here! Every convoluted, disjointed, baseless notion and occult "fact" you could hope for. One wonders why the enthusiasts who gravitate toward this stuff never wake up. Where are the RESULTS? Have you won the lottery lately? Any gods materialize to provide you with a cure for cancer? How about being able to walk through walls or fly? Can you do either one of those yet? Nope? I thought not! But keep purchasing this type of material! Keep wasting your life practicing it! Keep rationalizing the lack of success or results! Keep on! What else have you got to do 
 I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read.  I did not like it because of several reasons.  First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.   One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.   Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.  The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.   Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk. (By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.)  
 Absurd humor is a very difficult thing to pull off. When it works, it's funnier than just about anything you can think of. And when it fails.... you get The Andy Milonakis Show.  The entire show revolves around a grown man who, for some reason, looks like a 12 year old boy (...whatever) doing weird things. Had this been executed with a little tact, or any sense of intelligence whatsoever, the possibilities could have been endless for this show. However, Andy Milonakis is a terrible performer, incredibly irritating, and the "writing" on the show is just about as lame and unfunny as it could possibly be.  Look, I'm a HUGE fan of absurd humor. Pretty much anything on adult swim, the Tenacious D show, Family Guy, Monty Python, Mr. Show, I live for that stuff. But leave it to MTV to pick up the worst, most watered down variant of this style of comedy to put on their pathetic network. It takes intelligence and skill to pull off a show like this, and Andy Milonakis doesn't have any of these things. Avoid at all costs 
 I found the book little more than a disorganized glossary of explosives and related terms. Yes, it does have hundreds of different explosives types listed, many of which are very esoteric and rare.  And it does contain good thermodynamic data for many explosives. But the explosives, terms, and safety data are all lumped together and only classified alphabetically in a single group. Coverage is spotty.  For example, black powder gets good coverage (relative to the overall superficial coverage of all subjects), while TNT is barely mentioned.  Prills are covered in some detail while nitrification isn't even mentioned.  Manufacturing techniques and intermediate reactions are at most just a few sentences, even for important commercial explosives. All the information contained in the book can easily be found on the Internet or at your local library, and in much better detail 
 I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.  A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.  In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.  Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance 
 I READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOXED SET AND NOBODY EVER SAID THAT THE DVD IS SO DARK THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE A OUTLINE OF BRUCE ONLY. I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY, IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE MAIN PERFORMER THEN WHY WASTE THE SPACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE ONLY PERSON THAT YOU CAN SEE GOOD IS THE SAX PLAYER BECAUSE HE'S WEARING A WHITE SUIT AND ONCE IN A WHILE THEY PUT A WHITE SPOT ON HIM. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OTHER DVD'S..................... 
 In this book James Hansen manages the impossible by making the journey of the first men to the moon unbelievably dull! Part of the problem lies with the subject. Neil Armstrong comes across as an intensely private man, modest to a fault and unwilling to "dish the dirt" on his colleagues - time and again, when asked about some of the controversies that have arisen from the Apollo program he refuses to be drawn and usually gives some self effacing response or gives obscure convoluted technical explanations. It makes for a frustrating read. The space program aside, Armstrong appears to have led a fairly uneventful life - during his detailing of Armstrong's combat duty in Korea Hansen is reduced to writing about the other, more exciting missions experienced by his fellow fliers or reeling off endless reams of statistics to pad out some not very interesting events.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the book only comes to life during the description of Apollo 11's mission and even then one has to wade through paragraphs of technical jargon. I realise that to some extent this is unavoidable but then I remember that Jim Lovell's book about Apollo 13, "Lost Moon" (later retitled because of the movie) was similarly full of technical info yet it never felt dull and in fact gripped me from beginning to end.  Overall, "First Man" was a disappointing experience. I normally plough through books very quickly but found this one a real struggle to stick with. I have to admit that before I got to the Appollo section I had put it aside for a few weeks as I was fed up with it. I replaced it with "Dear Boy" - Tony Fletcher's wonderfully entertaining biography of Keith Moon. I came back eventually but was left feeling that there must be a better book out there about the Apollo astronauts 
 Like most people who made the effort to see this movie, I read Tim Sandlin's book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Unfortunately for this movie, Sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter.  The film is disjointed, awkward, and hard to follow. It quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another, allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story.  The casting isn't bad-- a prepubescent Mischa Barton was a fine choice (a hysterical one for fans of the O.C.), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also respectable, although she doesn't fit her character's physical description-- but that doesn't nearly make up for the film's jumpy direction and half-baked plot.  In sum, this is a dissatisfying and substandard film. Undoubtedly, the subject matter is better suited for a novel, and Sandlin's humor and talents are better utilized there.  Read his books. Avoid this movie. 
 This album sounds like stuff left over from their other CDs, stuff that didn't make the cut then. It doesn't now either. I'm not happy with this CD at all 
 The texture of this product is fine, but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore, therefore overpriced.   Now, if the flavor and scent were exceptional it might be worth the high price tag, but it doesn't smell that great. It smells rather like over cooked coffee beans.  The Bare Escentuals Soy Mocha SPF 15 has a much nicer smell and texture, if you're wanting a Bare Escentuals product 
 This is one of her finer albums, but with this artist that is not saying a great deal.  She has better song selection on this album than on previous ones, but her voice is still no comparison to the other ladies of country music 
 It is missing information about who were the actual thinkers on whose views the theory Postcolonialism is based 
 What the hell happened to these guys, not that they had much to offer in the past but damn, this is the apitamy of falling off. This band sucks just more so then they ever did. When your a big name band in the past then you come to play the Charleston Municipal Auditorium, you have really hit rock bottom!!. You can bet I will not be attending, and i cant imagine many others attending either!  Give it up Godsmack your not with the times anymore, your horribl 
 Was hoping this would be a lot of fun for my 9 year old, and her younger brothers, too.  Forget it.  Extremely overwhelming for beginner dancers and fair-to-middlin' dancing moms, too.  The moves are cool, no doubt.  But my kids won't even attempt it. The coordination is not there.  NOT, NOT, NOT begginner friendly.  Too fast and too hard 
 There are as many nights as days, and the one is just as long as the other in the year's course. Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word 'happy' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. -Carl Jung    The story of Bone written by Fae Myenne Ng is a dramatic story that takes place in Chinatown of San Francisco. It is based on the lives of a Chinese American family that has lost the life of a family member. The family is frowned upon because Mah the mother of Ona, Leia, and Nina had 3 daughters. To have a female child is to have bad luck, because they are useless, they show no bravery, they serve no purpose but to have children and they disrespect the families' name. The book touches upon all different aspects of Leia's life in no chronological order, she relives each story through incisive memoirs. You learn that Mah had an affair, with a man and he left her when he knew she was having a daughter. Then she met Leon; Leon worked in the shipping industry and Mah at the baby store. Mah and Leon fell quickly for each other. But when Leon was out at sea she was secretly in love with Tommie Hom. He had hired Mah for her looks, even though she could not sew at all. Tommie taught Mah how to sew beautiful dresses almost as fast as the patterns were printed. She became the best sewing lady Tommie had ever had.  As a kid Ona loved to wait for Leon's ship to come in, she cried for days after he left for sea. She was the type of kid that became emotionally wrapped around anyone she met. Ona loved to be around people all the time, she spent her days at the butcher shop with the owner, and he taught her how to wrap the raw meat to be sold. She also liked to hang out in the laundry room with Leon. One day Tommie Hom decided to hire a women by the name of Rosa she was a lovely woman that Mah quickly become attached to when teaching her how to sew. They became such good friends that Rosa's husband Luc and Leon liked to be in each other's company. When one day they decided to close up the baby shop and open a Laundry Mat in their name. It was a good success but it did not last long. A few months after they opened and all the bills were just being paid off Leon and Mah went in to open up the shop and to their surprise they could not open the door, the lock had been changed. They called Luc but no one would answer. That's when they learned that they had been taken advantage of. Ona had fallen in love with Luc and Rosa's son Osvaldo. Leon was furious with her but the more he hated there relationship the more they fell for each other.  The story touches upon death, Ona whose troubled life ends tragically in early adulthood when she jumped to her death at the top of the Nam because she was prohibited from marrying the man she loved.  The book episodes all different aspects of Leia's life in no consecutive order, she relives each story through incisive memoirs. Through out much of the book you learn about Ona and how the family deals with the guilt. Everyone wonders why she jumped, they ask over and over how they could prevented this, but the family learns in time that your fate is determined by the choices you make. Leia makes her way from feeling guilty to parting the ways between sadness and being truly happy like a ship liner on the open sea. The sea is life and the liner is the awakening.  I believe to get the most out of this book you must look for a deeper meaning. The author is Chinese American and they are traditionally instilled with a form of emotional meanings. While reading this book I realized that I saw what the Leong family endured was incredibly sad and that is had a unfortunate effect on the family. I did not allow myself to become emotionally surrounded by what the Leong family was faced with. They encountered death, and pain, sadness and defeat but they still moved on to support each other and they moved on with life. They learned with every life there is death and with every affliction their will be gallantry.  Fae Myenne Ng describes each moment with descriptive language each sentence takes you to a sidewinding conclusion. In her memoirs you get a strong feeling of deep emotion, from guilt, to love, pain, and grief are completely described in a narrative perspective. The type of memoir used was very serious it gave the story line a very mysterious title. You can tell how Fae pictured Ona, she was like a blossom she was radiant and sweet, full of life and loved. When Ona was stopped from marrying the man she wanted dearly she could not subside from such a cold-hearted decision from the traditional Chinese family.  Birth and Death are the two noblest expressions of bravery. --Kahlil Gibra 
 some of the movies that claim to be in color are black and white. not too many really good movies, but i guess you can't expect much for the price 
 Ok I loved the first two movies.  I in fact just bought part 1 today.  The 3rd however does not compare to the first two.  It had an ok begenning for the first 15, 20 minutes then from there on there was nothing.  During the rest of the movie things would just happen with no explanation.  Like his son just showing up in the north pole.  The worst thing though was it took an hour for Jack Frost to get Santa to say the things he had to say to lose his position as santa.  Yet you have to watch an hour of frost messing things up in santas toy shop and messing with other little things.  After you see the movie you will ask yourslef why?  Why did he do all this when he only needed one thing to get what he wanted.  Then after watching this long drawn out movie that had so many dead ends and other things added for no reason it takes the old santa 10-15 minutes to bring things back to the way they were.  I laughed at a few parts and other more than likely will as well.  But when you are through watching it you will feel like you just heard a stupid joke, or you saw something on the news that someone did that is totally ridiculous.  You'll just say why 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 I felt sorry for my daughter this past Summer. She picked this book out of a list of 5 to read for school. The writing was all over the place, the plot went nowhere. Really boring. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...... 
 While John Steinbeck is a master of Literature, The Long Valley's stories are all dull and some don't even feel like stories, but just descriptions of things (the short story "Breakfast" was overly pointless). This collection starts off great, with a couple of wonderful stories, but the second half of the book (along with The Red Pony parts (another of John Steinbeck's drab writings)) is very bad and yawn-inducing.  My favorite story was "The Flight", and that is the only reason I am rating this 2 stars instead of 1. "Johnny Bear" is also a good story in this collection, and a fairly humorous one as well.  Check this out at the library for a couple of good stories, but do not purchase it as it would be a waste of money. If you want to read great works by Steinbeck, check out East Of Eden, The Grapes Of Wrath, and Of Mice And Men 
 Zulakika's Basque Violence is a confusing and chaotic work which attempts to examine the cultural background to the question of why a terroristic form of violence haunts the Basque people.  The works' shortcomings are abundant and ubiquitous throughout his writing.  No one outside of the field of ethnography will be able to comprehend the overpowering amount of  ethnographic jargon that inundates Zulakika's work.  His work is also delinquent in the fact that very few readers outside of the Basque culture could understand or find the thesis of the work. The reader feels as if he or she is stuck the eccentric mind of a bedlamite, who is rattling off the hagiology of the Basque culture from the Paleolithic era to modern day. The book is structured in what would appear at first glance to be studies of different areas of Basque culture and its relation to the violence that has been occurring in the area; however, the book fails to accomplish this task as well.  Readers will be greatly disappointed with this work because it does not realize any of the intended goals that the author set for himself work 
 Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That  made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end 
 This man is so full of himself. He comes across as the cult of personality for the neopagan movement telling people who to ostracize and who to embrace. His hypocrisy is on the scale of Jim Baker. Read some of the drivel on his website if you don't believe me 
 As you may know, I taught for 7 years in an inner-city middle school. The issue of race in America came up daily, and some days it was an ever-present feature. I was forced to think about it all of the time and all I know is that I don't know enough to solve the issues and no one ever will. Nevertheless, on ocassion I am moved to visit these issues again. This book seemed to be as good a place as any.  Tony Brown is a Black man (he prefers that term) who has hosted a PBS discussion show called "Tony Brown's Journal" for years. He also hosts a Saturday talk show on WLS 890 AM out of Chicago that can be heard throughout the midwest thanks to their high wattage broadcast strength.  He is an interesting man and a good discussion leader on his shows. His views were fairly consistent with my own, although I think that his preceptions of white america are a little off, just as he would undoubtedly think that my views of black America are off. The first 1/3 and the last 1/3 are full of pretty good thoughts, observations and ideas, except for their repitiveness.   The middle 1/3 is a bit bizarre. It concerns AIDS and his denial that it even exists. He claims that AIDS is not real because there are 30+ diseases that are associated with it. He wonders how certain types of cancers and certain types of fungal infections and viruses can all be from the same disease. He misunderstands that these diseases are presumed to be symptoms of AIDS since they are rare and usually are only present to people with depressed immune systems - which happens to people with AIDS (thus its name). He also touts a theory that claims that AIDS was started accidentally by using viruses from Monkeys to create a Smallpox vaccine that was used in Africa in the 1970s. After doing a google search I can tell you that he is not alone with this belief, but most others who share it assume that it was a racist plot by the US government in an effort to control population.  I was disappointed by "Black Lies, White Lies" because I like Brown's TV & radio shows. I give this book '2 stars' for its repitive nature and the bizarre middle of the book.  As an addendum, I thought I would add these conclusions that were gleaned from a poll and interviews by the "Washington Post" of black students and their beliefs concerning education that he quoted. I thought the poll pretty much encapsulated the attitudes of black students (as a whole) that I had in the Indianapolis Public Schools:  *Black students are poor and stay poor because they are dumber than Whites. *Black kids who do their homework and behave must want to be white. White kids who do poorly or dress cool want to be Black. *Black people don't want to work hard. *Blacks don't need to work hard because it won't matter in the end. *Blacks have to be bad so they can fight and defend themselves from other Blacks. *Blacks see their badness as natural. *Black men make women pregnant and leave. *Black boys expect to die unnaturally. *White people are smart and have money.  In my experience, the poll-takers nailed these attitudes dead on. I fought against these feelings for years, but to be honest, I got wore out and left the Indianapolis Public Schools partially because I couldn't turn it aroun 
 I wish I could understand liberals, I really do. One reviewer here complains about how Bush can't technically be tagged a liar because of his use of generalities. Isn't saying that Bush is "WRONG ABOUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING" a generality? I mean, really -- he was wrong to even pardon the Turkey before Thanksgiving? For those without a sense of humor (or your average NPR listener) that was a witticism, what Americans call jokes.   Gosh you get mad when people point out you "hate" America, but isn't this book a testament to that fact? Just to save you some time, I understand that you are now thinking that I am both a nazi who believes "W" is synonymous with "America" and I'm also a McCarthyite who smears anyone who doesn't agree with my "America, right or wrong" mentality. So with that out of the way, only an insane person would believe that Bush isn't desperately concerned with protecting America and defeating REAL religious fanatics that want to do terrible things to YOU before cutting your head off. Whether you agree with his methods is a different story, but if you don't agree with his sentiment than you identify with the enemies of America and therefore can't possibly be patriotic. You are agreeing that it is more important to write a book about hating our president rather than the crazy, WMD-sucking madmen who killed over 3,000 Americans in mere seconds, and would be more than happy to continue doing so.   If you DO agree that Bush is sincere in his desire to protect America than he can't be wrong about everything, and you have somewhat of a social duty to not totally crap on the man most responsible for keeping us free and safe (until Hillary wins in 2008, of course).  If you think the war is a pretext to take over the world, and that Bush has confused national security with world conquest - well, then you have either the option of a pill to cure you, or a cult to embrace you. But even to the girls who earn hard cash a dollar at a time adjacent to a greasy pole you would be considered quite dumb. Let me ask you -- if we were after oil, then why didn't we take it in 1990 with the 1st Gulf War? Isn't that what you said at the time was our reason for going to war then (oh I know it is -- I was in DC at the time and saw the protests on the mall regularly). And if we liberated Iraq to conquer it, why did they have elections with no one named "Smith" or "Johnson" on the ballot? And finally, WHY IS OIL TO DAMN EXPENSIVE TODAY???  Jeez, I WISH we had gone to war for oil, at least I wouldn't have to buy cheaper cigars just so I can keep my SUV topped-off!  All in all, having perused these books, let me just remind you that "HATE" is not a family value, and also that Canada is a lovely, lovely place to live. 
 Sally Mann hasn't a clue how to capture the souls of those she photographs!  If you are looking for artistic shots of 12 year olds then this book isn't for you.  The picture on the cover is deceiving about the books contents.  You're better off with buying the David Hamilton books (oh and by the way he is much better at photographing his subjects than Sally Mann could ever hope to be).  
 First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan.  I love the majority of his work. Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book. I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book.  What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises.  None.  Not like "Of Mice And Men" or "East Of Eden" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck.  Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book.  If you've read his bio you must read "Grapes Of Wrath" to understand why Californians hated him so much.  In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book.  One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved "Grapes Of Wrath".  Go figure 
 This product is an absolute piece of junk. Do not buy this product. Will not even load properly onto computer. Have wasted several hours trying to install product on windows XP platform with no success. I have wasted a whole day trying to install this piece of junk on my computer, now I will probably waste another day trying to return this bunch of garbage to the vendor. 
 Here's an example - "If all religions lead to God, but some of them claim to be the _only_ way to God - isn't that a contradiction?"  Well, no.  If I choose to believe (notice, _I_ am choosing to believe) that all religions which teach certain beliefs which I hold as universal spiritual principles will lead to gnosis of the Supreme, the fact that the Denoberites believe that belief in Denoberite doctrine is essential to that spiritual development is irrelevant.    Or, to put it in real world terms - the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church holds that salvation outside of that church is impossible.  Lutheran Christians may (in all probability, do) hold a similar belief regarding their own church. If I believe that _both_ of them can come to know God and attain salvation - there's no contradiction on my end.  If I throw Buddhists, Wiccans and Eckanckar-ists into the mix - likewise, no contradiction.  Similarly, the 'true for you, not for me' presupposes at least two different values of 'true'.  From the point of view of a nonbeliever, a Christian's faith in YHWH is equivalent to an Asatruan's faith in Odin or Thor. Odin's existence is 'true' for the worshipper in the second case, but it's the same kind of 'true' as G-d's existence in the first case.  Then there's the 'true' of 'it is true that water is wet.'  The usual thing about writers like Copan that sticks sideways in my throat is the assumption that what _he believes_ is the second kind of true, whereas what other people believe is the first kind.  Hope that helps!  
 The book starts out slow, and it weaves its way through the past and present, which gets a little annoying.  While it does have some feeling to it, and it does give a good insight to what life for african americans was like back then, I was for the most part dreadfully bored with the book.  Not something I'd really recommend to people to read 
 I was GREATLY disappointed in this DVD. Here's why:  1. It's basically 60 minutes of warming up 2. The level 3 (advanced) is not THAT HARD. 3. The annoying "inhale, exhale" chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center.' I just wanted to tell her SHUT UP 4. I didn't break a sweat once.  5. I used it twice and never plan to use it again. I mean, c'mon, I don't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that won't get me results.   I must say the ONLY THING positive about this DVD is the landscape.   In short, rent this from Blockbuster or buy it used. Don't waste any more than 5 bucks on this. It's not worth it.  
 I am very surprised with the rave reviews of this book here. I decided to purchase it for two reasons. First, I trusted the reviews here and decided it would be important to own this book. Second, I am familiar with Douglas Holt's academic work, and have read his articles in academic journals. I thought this book will be very interesting to read.  I am dissapointed mainly because I find that the book does not tell me something original. Instead what Douglas Holt keeps saying in this book is that building an iconic brand is possible by focusing on culture not products. His argument is not convincing, especially when he tries to disprove other forms of brand building: tradition, cultural and emotional. If I have a brand new product, can I still build an icon? Is it advantageous to have an iconic brand? What are the downside of it? These are not talked about in the book.   Another problem is that he keeps repeating the same argument again and again. It gets very boring after a few pages only.   What a disappointment! 
 Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 I hate lawyers.  What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb.   Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"   Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it.   But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money.   Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention.   I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?  What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**.   Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice.   Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment.   So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner.   Talk about contempt of court.  Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob.   Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much.   Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice.   Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't.   Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.    Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous.   If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar.   Otherwise, case dismissed.   JS 
 This book would be good for someone just starting out in the miniature "world." Most experienced collectors figured these things out as a child. Great book for a child! Or, if you're just starting out, you need this to get very basic information 
 Absolutely do not buy this video.  1) The fights are not fights. they are boring and tiresome staged tapping, pushing and pulling matches. Nobody wants to hurt anyone, and nobody wants to get hurt.   2)Jerry Springer fights are 10 times better than anything on this video. These girls keep their clothes on , and tussle like 4th grade girls at a sleepover.   3)ModelFight.com has their name on the box and these girls are not model quality and they don't fight.   4) The most violence these girls can conjure up is to giggle and smile into the camera and say "you better get out my room ! *smiling* *No, You get out !* says the other girl while pushing the other girl on the bed.   Complete waste of time and money.  You want chick fights, look elsewhere. 
 This is yet another one of a long series of "cause" books so overburdened with the author's personal whining that whatever message might be present is lost.  Let's be honest: If you are a "Cultural Creative" (what an ego!) you are most likely left-leaing politically, theologically and economically. The so-called wide swath of participants is actually a narrow ribbon.  The most disillusioning aspect about the whole work was the utter predictability of the whole thing. Take any subject (taxes, home schooling, abortion), listen to NPR, and immediately you know a "Cultural Creative's" stand. Not only their stand but their expressed purpose to guide the rest of us dumb yokels to their viewpoint by hook or crook.  You see, ignorance (wrong choices) is just not allowable.  A strong undertone of authoritarianism runs throughout as if he finds it unbelievable that anyone could disagree with his premises much less his conclusions.   Who in their right mind does NOT want a kinder, more educated, more humane, do I daresay wealthier society? We are worshipping at the altar of innocent primitivism here.  Incans may have been happier without overtime, cars, TV or fast food but I prefer medicines, dentists, cell phones, air conditioning and plentiful food. At this point we glimpse the elitism and paternalism.  Like sinners of old, we must be cleansed of our bad thoughts and repent (an evangelistic tone runs is rampant). We either adopt their viewpoint and "save the planet" or (I guess) allow Earth to self-destruct. The simple truth is: Americans are not ideologues much less misguided utopians.  We are practical folk, weaned on experience and tradition, working with what we are given and can make. Our concerns are not for some nebulous future but for ourselves and our families.  And with those goals in mind we each attempt to better ourselves, our children and the world about us.    
 I would suggest that you rent this before buying it!  Unlike the reviews above it was one of the worst thing I have ever seen.  I walked out of the theatre on this and there were many people on the lobby that walked out before me!  This is not a film for everyone and requires a very special taste!  There was no story...that I could see just a bunch of clips that made no sense 
 I was truly disappointed in this book. I bought it so that I could understand Ayurveda, but this writter discounts the true principles. He refers to Vata, Pita and Kapha as Body Types A,B and C. I think he should call it by the proper names and not try to take shortcuts. It is not a well written book on the subject. If you are interested in Ayurveda, I highly recommend Deepak Chopra's "Perfect Health". Not only does Chopra cover the topic completely, his book is inspiring. Perfect Balance is unrealistic. It recommends that people take teaspoons of spices and herbs daily. While the true way of following Ayurveda is to cook with the spices and herbs in the food. I do not recommend this book. It has some helpful information, but not enough. Why read more then one book on the subject? Deepak Chopra's book covers it all and he also has a website that offers Ayurveda products 
 This book completely held my attention as I said, "Yes! Yes!", to everything I read.  The author put words around so many things I have thought and felt for many years. Truth rings out on every page as the author points out the Biblical way, without being condemning nor judgmental 
 after a year of sobriety, including two months of AA meetings in the beginning of that year.  When it was time to drink again, I found his book and read it, and quoted it to my wife to get her to agree to let me drink again, though only beer and wine, of course.  Fingarette is correct: there are very heavy drinkers who are NOT alcoholics. They just drink a lot. If they stop drinking, or cut down, drink-related problems go away.  But if you are a real alcoholic, alcohol is not your problem. If alcohol is your problem, you are not an alcoholic.   I've given it a lot of thought in the 15 years since I made it back (almost didn't) to the sober world 
 I have had a horrible experience with this toy. The email that I sent to the company, which follows, explains it well. Because it is a long email I will sum it up (for those who don't have the time to read such a lengthy review) by saying that the quality of this product is amongst the lowest I have ever encountered with any consumer product. Many pieces do not fit well together, other are too tight, one piece does not work, and another piece was intentionally made to not operate correctly. I had enjoyed Capsela as a child, which was a wonderful and high quality toy back then, but now I have been utterly disheartened by the garbage that is now manufactured as Capsela.  Dear Educational Insights:   There are moments in my childhood that will remain forever blissful. The reminiscence of playing with Capsela ranks as one of my all time favorites. I played with and enjoyed Capsela for many years as a child starting with the 500 set. Later on, I got the 5000 set, and then I finally got the 1000 set.   I do not know what happened to my 500 or 5000 sets, but I still had the 1000 set when I got older. About five years ago, I accidentally left it behind when I moved. I have a daughter who is now eight-years-old, and I decided to purchase the 1000 set so that she and I can enjoy a wonderful way for her to learn about science: through the timeless play of Capsela.   I am appalled at what sits in front of me. I am so disappointed that I actually feel nauseous. The quality of this toy is utterly horrific. This horrible experience started with the motor capsule. The connection to the output of the motor is unbelievable loose; the toy falls apart during operation. It is so loose that the lightest piece, a coupler, connected with an Octagonal Connector will fall right off the motor capsule. I thought that perhaps this was a fluke, and I was originally going to contact you to see if I could exchange this poor part with a better one. Upon playing with more of the parts, it was obvious that this was no fluke; almost all the piece were spectacularly bad. I played with about half of the parts, and here is a list of problems that I found:   --There are connections which are so loose amongst many of the capsules and other connecting parts that the capsules and parts disconnect during normal play.   --There are connections which are so tight on some capsules and other connecting parts that it would be impossible for an eight-year-child to disassemble. (I hurt my fingers disconnecting some of these tight parts myself.)   --There was an Octagonal Connector connecting two Transmission Capsules together, an Octagonal Connector connecting two Capsules (empty) together, and an Octagonal Connector connected to a single Capsule. I actually remember my first 1000 set having these connections when I first opened it. I surmise that this is done during packaging so that these capsules, which can be separated into two halves, stay assembled during storage. The problem is that the Octagonal Connector on the single Capsule cannot be removed. I did not try to use any tools to remove it because I suppose it is possible that union is intentionally permanent. It should not be a permanent connection, and the Octagonal Connector should be able to be removed.   --One of the Crown Wheel Capsules does not work: the gears do not mesh properly. The reason for this has to do with the next problem.   --The Speed Reduction Capsule, the Worm Gear Capsule, the Crown Wheel Capsules, the Internal Gear Capsule, and the Clutch Capsule all have an internal piece that supports some of the gear shafts. These support pieces are loosely fitted in each capsule which causes a lot of vibration (the gear shafts are not stable because of it) and an excess amount of noise. The problems of vibration and noise are very bad in the Worm Gear Capsule; it is so bad that the noise is almost intolerable.   --Some of the Chain pieces do not connect tightly. As a result, these loose pieces disconnect during operation, and the chain falls off the Gear Wheels. (The Chain and Gear Wheels used to be my favorite part of this toy.)   --The Capsules (empty) can be separated into two halves. These two halves fit together, but not so well. When only one side of these capsules is connected, the opposite end is slightly ajar due to imperfect alignment. This really is not an operational problem as much as it is an aesthetic problem. There are a few projects where a Capsule has only one connection, and the ajar end makes it look ugly.   --There has been a design change in the wires and the way that they connect to the parts which receive these connections. At first glance, it did seem like an improvement. The connecting ends of the wires are now shrouded. These plastic shrouds have a tooth which fits into a notch in either the Motor Capsule, the Rotary Switch Capsule, or the Switch Box. The teeth on the shrouds of the red wires are not big enough, and as such, the teeth do not fit into the notches which means the wires do not have to line up when making the connections. This is not a problem since the wire does not actually need to be connected a certain way, but it is another low quality attribute of this experience.   --Although not a problem, I disapprove that the battery cases are now fastened with screws. This does not make for easy exchange of the batteries (as infrequent as it may be).   --It may be trivial, but the cardboard separators inside the box are flimsy, and do a lousy job at organizing the pieces. The original foam packaging was much better.   --This final problem is the one which prompted me to actually contact you about all of these problems. The Rotary Switch Capsule does not work. The reason it does not work is not because of some horrible manufacturing. It does not work because there is a wire inside the capsule that connects the electrical connectors on both ends of the capsule together! This is unbelievable! This totally defeats the purpose of the Rotary Switch Capsule. Even to a person who has not had any sort of analog electronics experience can plainly see through this transparent capsule that this wire provides an uninterrupted current. The whole point of this capsule IS to interrupt the current as it spins so as to create a blinking light. Why, OMG, please answer me why, is there a wire on the inside of this capsule that allows the current to pass right along? I have had a course in analog electronics, and this connection makes no sense. You have totally ruined this capsule with this connection. Why have you done this?   I know that Educational Insights was not the original owner of Capsela. It is apparent that your purchase of the Capsela name was only for monetary gain. You do not care about the quality of the product you brand nor the scientific, learning experience which this toy can provide. You have grossly ruined a wonderful toy. Now instead of my daughter learning about science through educational play, she gains "educational insights" into the substandard commercialism caused by the corporate world of greed 
 I thought these muffins tasted like white rice bread which isn't very tasty.  I've made my own muffins mixing brown rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch flour and they are a million times better.  Won't buy these again.  I expected these to be as close to the real thing as the Glutino crackers are to regular crackers(not the tomato basil but the plain ones) but they weren't 
 Andrew Weill is perhaps the most well-known of these type of practioners.  Unfortunately, some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven. For example, in study after study, large amnounts of Vitamin C given orally do absolutely nothing more than a   placebo for cancer patient.  Yet he still preaches this.  Given intravenously, actually, there is some evidence that it may work for some people..but it does not work by stimulating your immune system..it works in a different way.  The book How To treat and Prevent Cancer with Natural Medicine is far superios in my opinion, even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002.  Even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking Vitamin C orally over a placebo,  and the authors freely admitted it. But much of what the discussed in that book..Eight Magic supplements to take when you have cancer..has actually been proven. I am a cancer patient with myeloma.  Maitake D fraction, curcumin (it must be taken w/bioperine an hour before meals), selenium, and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on.  They do not promise that they have a cure of anything..they only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine. They do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure.  The book by Quiallan I think claims that an organic diet will cure you, and there is post after post that this has actually worked.  Maybe it has..but as a myeloma patient..my immune system is overstimulated, so I cannot take most immune system supplements..and some like Vitamin C are actually antagonistic In Vitro to myeloma treatments..this usually translates to the same thing in the body..unlike positive in studies that often do not pan out.  Anyway, I am not saying Dr. Weill is all wrong, but do not pretend he has a cure.  I have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice, another two by healers (I  am not religious), and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his PH totally got rid of his cancer.  I believe these people all may have gotten rid of their LOCALIZED tumors this way. For blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloma (a cancer of blood produced in the marrow), we do not exactly have localized tumors.  But with the addition of supplements mentioned in Dr. Murray et al's book, my response to medications has been phenomenal and I have went into remission. Unfortunately, at this time, myeloma always comes back from remission. There is new understanding why this may be so..that just came out December 2005.  There is even a drug available..but it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while 
 I bought this book because my late 70's Better Homes Cookbook was seriously falling apart.  Since I am a breast cancer survivor, I decided to go with the Pink Plaid Edition.  I was hoping the Pink Plaid would be a good replacement, but I'm not at all happy with it.  Many of the wonderful recipes in my old book are gone.  The few recipes I did try, I didn't like at all.  Many of the recipes included, in this edition, are not the types of foods my family will eat.  This book seems to have far more fluff and less recipes than the books of yesteryear.  I purchased the Pink Plaid cookbook ONLY a year ago and the 5-ring binder has came loose from the back of the book's hard cover.  The broken binder is not from overuse, as I've only used it a few times.  I am again looking for a replacement 
 Received as a Christmas present, dead by February 24.  Well, actually, that's two months.  Now all it does is flash an error message, and nothing I do gets it out of that mode.  I liked it before it died on me 
 I am a huge fan of the original Hugh Lofting Dr. Dolittle and not this shallow abridged version.  A good part of the story is cut and the history is mutilated.  The illustrations are obviously not complete Hugh Loftings even though they still bear his name.  Many of his illustrations have been cut and pasted  blending them with some weird Victorian style prints.  The result is a jumbled mishmash.  As a kid, I'm offended that they would take a wonderful piece of literature and trample it with political correctness jargon.  There are things said in the original version that I understand would not be appropriate today.  But it was a part or our history.  And it gives a great opportunity for discussions with parents.  As for this story, what is left?  The character depth is ruined.  The vocabulary is rudimentary.  Utter trash.  Don't waste your time.  Original unabridged or nothing 
 Having first seen the movie, I was prepared that this was not a starry-eyed wholesale endorsement of high school football, but I was still thrilled when my wife surprised me with a copy to read.  I have never been so dissapointed with a book on football, or all of sports for that matter. I enjoyed Next Man Up and A Civil War, due to Feinstein's balance between negative and positive lights on the game. Bissinger, in Friday Night Lights, shows no such balance. He does not "follow the season" in any logical fashion, sometimes skipping entire games, and spends a chapter instead focusing on national politics. Honestly, you'll see the name of Michael Dukakis more than you will the name of Permian's starting quarterback.  I love football, I love high school athletics, and found this book to be very annoying. Check it out in a library before you spend your dollars on it 
 I'll admit right out that I am only a student (college) and still (relatively) new to studying the history of the conflict, but with that said believe that this book was given the wrong title.  The title leads you to believe that maybe finally there has been an unbiased book written about the conflict that will refute both sides stories and give you some truth, but all I seem to find is information that discredits the Arab side of the story, leaving it extremely one-sided.  I believe that this book in the wrong hands has the potential to produce some violent anti-Arab behavior.  Look at the chapter devoted to Arabs threatening Jews, you could just as easily fill a chapter with Jews threatening Arabs, but what positive effect will that have?  For those of you in my position, just started out researching the topic and maybe still a bit naive, it is my recommendation to stay away from this book.  It is easy for some to fall into the trap of either anti-Semitism or anti-Arab sentiments and this book is only an invitation for the latter.  
 This is a disgrace... don't waste your mone 
 I found this book to be very good, but lacks information on horse breeds. Not all of the horse breeds are represented 
  There's a saying: "No one sets out to make a bad movie."  BROTHERS GRIMM (Miramax) might prove otherwise.  Near the beginning of his commentary, the usually brilliant Terry Gilliam actually says, "I didn't like the script, but I was out of work."  Not a good sign but an honest admission from the former Python.  Although wonderfully visualized, the Czech locations can't make-up for the muddled mess of a screenplay culled from perhaps the richest mother lode of raw story material available anywhere: The collected fairy tales of Wilhem and Jacob Grimm.    In spite of stars Heath Ledger and Matt Damon as con artist exorcists who encounter real evil, a great poster and an OK trailer, audiences rightfully stayed away via quick word of mouth ("incomprehensible" "unwatchable"). Worthy extras of interest mainly to budding filmmakers are Gilliam's commentary and the featurette: "The Visual Magic of the Brothers Grimm. 
 i really like the look of the toaster, and it does a nice job; on one side. the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired, or likely, will have to get a new one. 
 I tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable. You didnt even have one walker availiable, How is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker? I was very disapionted. I guess that I would have to rate you with a zero. And I would like to know when will there be any walkers available? I like to shop with Amazon 
 I have only read one of the chapters that is shown by Amazon to help pitch the book. I can only say that if the other chapters reflect some of the same tact as the chapter I read about owning your own business I would not be impressed.  Much of the information given contributes to the false hype that we hear about being in business for oneself. No mention of the cost associated with investment required, or for cost of living while trying to get business in the door, or equipment needed to run even a small service business. The fact is that most people don't make it beyond 5 years in business. The taxes paid to the government is twice as much listed because someone that is self-employed pays all of the fees, i.e., social security, Medicaid, eccetera per quarter. This equals almost 13% of earnings, this does not include the income tax to be paid.  The example given only reflects half of that amount.  What about healthcare? Employers offer some reimbursement here typically, some offer 401K contributions.  The facts that are listed relative to the earning one would make by owning a business versus working for someone else are not telling the whole story. 
 I was listening to KMFDM about 11 years ago and was a very big fan of theirs until the MDFMK/Attak era. There are some decent songs on here but it's really nothing special. Nothing new or exciting. In fact, I'm inclined to say this is total garbage when compared to Nihil or Xtort, which were both fantastic albums. And umm... can you really say they're based in Germany when the German fellows left (or whatever) and the "Kaptin" seems to have a Russian name? Anyway, if you are thinking about buying this as your first KMFDM album (which i doubt since they're just milking old fans for money and not bringing many new ones on at this point) don't. Buy some GOOD KMFDM like Nihil, Xtort, Money, Angst or "Symbols" instead to see what KMFDM really was, and should be 
 I did not choose to read this book... my great-grandmother gave it to me for christmas years ago and I knew I should read it sooner or later. So I read it.  And didn't like it. It was boring, and to me there was no point and each different part starts off like the part before last never happened. These stories don't seem to connect to each other, and I was confused and I wish that the whole story could've been about "The Red Pony" like the title. Because I actually liked the first part, but the rest was a waste of my time. The only good thing I could say about it was that I finally got that one out of the way so now I can read more appealing books 
 I bought this specifically for information about using the new LiveCycle Designer application that comes with Acrobat Professional to create interactive PDF forms. All of the information in this book (Chapters 26-29) is wrong about that app--none of the dialog boxes match, or are even close, and the program doesn't work the way it's described. I'm guessing that Adobe changed it after the book was written. 
 This book is terrible.  I lived in Japan for more than a decade and I was planning a short excursion so I bought this book.  It was not helpful at all.  It covers the greatest hits of  Japan but has very little detail about most places. It seems to assume that you'd want to just ride the train all the time without ever getting off.  Most of the suggested trips are incredibly unrealistic about the amount of time it would take to visit the listed places, almost to the point of ridiculousness.  I do not recommend this book at all!  Any other guide book and a rail map would be much better.  If you are planning on traveling in Japan, skip "Japan by Rail" and get "Gateway to Japan" published by Kodansha.  It is the best 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 Will not recognize 99% of the photos stored on my hard drive including those taken with a Canon camera. Will not work with iPhoto. Customer service reps are zip help. Configuring print options is definately not intuitive 
 I have to agree with the other reviewer.  I got my Solio in December and it only charged via the sun twice.  After that, even after leaving the Solio in the sun for days it won't charge.  It only charges if I plug it in, making it useless for me.  I contacted Solio support and they replaced my Solio, but I've had the same problem once again.  Solio support has stopped responding to my emails and won't tell me what was wrong with my first product.  They also refuse to refund my money.  This is a great idea gone wrong STAY AWA 
 I honestly don't know what to think of my reactions to books by Maureen McKade.  I've read seven of her books.  Four I've rated 5 stars, three zero stars.  I'm sorry to say that the only reason I gave this one two stars (zero in my personal notation book) is because I have enjoyed other stories from Ms. McKade so very much.  I have my notes on other McKade books and am amazed.  Evidently I either love her stories or I don't like them at all.  Sorry to say, this is a don't like it at all for me.  Widow Laurel Covey is on a mission to visit the families of soldiers who made death bed statements to her while she was a nurse for the Confederate side in the war which ended just six months past.  Creede Forrester was searching for her to find out if she knew whether his son had died in battle.  His information indicated his son was wounded but now that the war is over, he cannot find his son.  Once he finds Laurel and understands what her mission is, his conscience will not allow him to let her make the last visitation trips alone.  He goes along with her even though she plainly states that she does not want him. This story does not "resonate with heartfelt emotion" as the cover states, for me   it was just plain depressing.  Everything turned out well for Laurel and Creede in the ending but it was a struggle for me to wade through all the war recollections and emotional baggage Laurel was carrying.  I know, I know.  That was the whole point of the story, but uplifting it was not!  A little bit of "happy" along the way would have gone a long way toward making this an easier read.  So very much seriousness just weighed me down.  I didn't WANT to finish reading it but I did.  Was the introduction of the starving, orphaned kitten supposed to form some of the "happy" moments which were otherwise sadly lacking?  If so, it didn't work out that way for me.  How could we be expected to believe that a starving, orphaned kitten could walk fifteen miles from one campsite to the next?  If the starving, orphaned kitten could do it, why did the perfectly healthy horses only make it those fifteen miles?  See, I'm being picky, picky, picky.  But once it starts, everything begins to snag my attention and I loose concentration and the desire to continue to read.  Sorry to be so negative but I just cannot see myself recommending this to anyone without a strong warning first.  I have two more Maureen McKade books left to read.  If my yo-yo is correct, surely one of them should be a five star read.  
 Those of you who hate O'Reilly will find this book funny. However, Bill has done more good than any news commentator in the USA. You can make fun of him all you want but he is the one getting results. From getting rid of liberal judges to protecting our kids with Jessica's law and holding our elected officials to the fire and fixing the Red Cross post 9/11 and putting the spot light on the ACLU. I can name many others but that will not convince some of you. The fact that he is the target of the liberal left says more about who they are than who O'Reilly is. At the end of the day, the truth will win out all the time. To put "Jesus" and "hate" in the same title is just another "satire" that can be excused by the coolaid drinkers but to the fair minded public, it is insensitive abd childish. 
 I can't find any notes in this book, only exercise, i was so disappointed with this book 
 Although I like Sadawi's fiesty, rebellious spirit, I must say that I was HIGHLY disappointed in her work! I rarely come across a book that I don't finish and to tell you the truth, she made me return the book. Her bland and simplistic writing style didn't go well with me. At times, this book even put me to sleep. Anyway, the real significant drawback of this book is that it is written in an extremely narraw perspective! The whole book is about her and her memoirs, you don't even know what the other person is thinking. Hence, if you ask me I would say: SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH!! 
 Combining dialogue that appears to have been lifted from old political pamphlets with a rock music score more appropriate to a modern cosmetics commericial (lots of guitars and vibraphones, let's call it "Rock On with NAWSA"), this film tells the viewer much more about Hollywood femnists' perceptions of the past, than it does about the past itself. All decked out in Edwardian costumes, the cast works its way through a series of thankfully brief scenes in which enlightened women slay dominant males with verbal ripostes and quips, all loaded with telling facts and figures that reveal the extent of sex discrimination in the Progressive Era. These scenes also include the occasional disgruntled woman, for the moment reluctant to enlist in the movement, yet after being exposed to a few suffragist talking-points, she too will take up the banner and join the NAWSA crusade. Perhaps the most forgettable moment in two hours of not very clever dialogue came early on when Alice told a Washington Post reporter: "I'm having dinner with Helen Keller." The reporter, "Don't stare, she hates that."  Yet, I suppose the most annoying aspect of this film is the music: rock is not only inapposite to the 1910s, it is completely at odds with the seriousness with which suffragists conducted their campaigns. Indeed, one of the few songs the producers chose from the early 20th century was "Ain't She Sweet"-- a Roarin' Twenties jazz standard introduced in 1927 by Paul Ash & His Orchestra at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago and thereafter adopted by such entertainers as Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker.   Alice Paul was hardly a flapper, nor was she an astute poitical strategist. She was a militant activist whose overwrought contribution to winning the vote for women only complemented the much greater, much more productive efforts of Carrie Chapman Catt (Angelica Huston) and others who had continued the struggle since Seneca Falls in 1848. Catt used Paul's antics to good effect in eventually persuading President Wilson (here, woefully overweight) to endorse suffrage as a route to victory in the Great War. Paul was at most a footnote in the process.   I showed this film to my Gilded Age-Progressive Era class last spring; consider a few written comments from today's undergraduates: "disjointed" -- "historically inept and emotion-ridden" -- "this was Hilary Swank in INSOMNIA Part 2" -- "numerous historical inaccuracies included women's hair and men's clothing styles from later eras, the misuse of props like a small woman's wrist watch and a Crown Graphic press camera, both of which did not exist in 1918, plus the American flag behind Wilson is hung backwards" -- "the parts where she (Paul/Swank) was jailed reminded me of that holocaust movie by Speiberg, but his was more convincing" & my favorite: "why not really screw it up and throw in a little Helen Reddy at the end? 
 Now, don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of NGDB, and have at one time or another owned all (or most) of their albums on tape, CD, or vinyl. I saw them in 1972, and 1975 when (in my opinion) they were at their creative peak. They are (again in my opinion) a wonderfully talented band, no matter who's in the line up. But, I have to say I was never fan of multi-artist albums. It seems to me a band's creativity can become diluted by straining  it through everone else's musical filter. The first Circle album was ok, simply because the concept was unique, and the songs were really good. The second and third time around, it has become tiresome and boring. The Dirt Band records so infrequently any more that it seems they put out a Circle album when they realize their fans are becoming restless. This newest version of Circle has to be the final one. How far can this concept be taken? The idea of long-haired, seeming rocker types doing country and bluegrass with stars of that genre in 1972 was novel and quite interesting, but this Circle album and the one right before it finds the Dirt Band stretching things a bit. Why can't NGDB record more original studio albums? Why can't they rekindle the innovative, original spark they had when I first discovered them? I realize people change as they get older, and musicians don't carry the creative fire with them throughout their long careers, but Lord a Mighty, this Circle stuff is getting old 
 I do not know why Stephen King let this trash be made. Read the short story instead and avoid this film

   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 "Is it really my failure, or theirs?"  Carol Kennicott asks herself this question nearly 250 pages into "Main Street," regarding her impossible relations with the residents of  the town of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. By this time, I was asking a similar question: "Is it really my failure, or Sinclair Lewis's?"  "Main Street" seemed a good idea as it sat on my shelf. Touted as a satirical look at middle-class America, it was Lewis's first successful novel, ushering in a new era upon its publication in 1920, and breaking critical ground for the Golden Age of American Literature, of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner. Lewis was the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. How could I go wrong picking it up?  The book tells the interminable story of Mrs. Kennicott, who marries a country doctor while imagining herself an improving influence on his as-yet-unseen town of Gopher Prairie. Imagine her surprise when she is greeted not as a liberator but grist for the gossip mill, with her Big City ideas and lack of churchiness.  Carol's alternating turns of resistance and acceptance are about the sum total of this plotless book. Lewis's descriptive powers are much in evidence, and you find yourself trapped in G.P. as much as Carol, his descriptions of noisy neighbors and smug dinner parties bearing the unmistakable imprint of someone who grew up in small-town Minnesota and knew of what he wrote. The problem, when you get past the period slang and the barbed commentary, is that the subjects of Lewis's satire are so miserable and nasty you can't understand why Carol thinks she can change them, except perhaps with the idea nature couldn't possibly create people as one-dimensional as those found here.  I thought I'd never read a duller work about small-town Americana from the early 20th century than Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." My apologies, Thornton. "Main Street" is as down on the same locale that "Our Town" exults, only Lewis lays on derision with a dripping trowel. Wilder, by contrast, seems almost surgical in the delicacy with which he makes his points. Lewis makes sure that when he presents us with the atheistic radical Miles Bjornstam, he is not only a voice of reason and affability to Carol but ultimately run out of town for his beliefs on the heels of having suffered a great tragedy, just in case we didn't otherwise get how miserable a town Carol is stuck in.  "And you want to reform people like that when dynamite is so cheap?" Carol fumes early on.  There is one effective section in the book, when Carol first discovers how isolated she has become and feels the "moist, fleering eyes" of prying neighbors so powerfully she draws down her window shades. Passages with her husband, the stolid, straying, but not worthless Dr. Kennicott, present some desperately-needed ambiguity.  But the book just keeps going, hammering home the same points, before winding down with an ending that feels more like a cop-out, in which the still-radical but more placid Carol settles for the status quo while imagining her sleeping infant daughter as "a bomb to blow up smugness." Polemics can produce great writing, but seldom great literature, and "Main Street" is a case in point.  The Signet Classic edition from 1998 features an introduction by Thomas Mallon which was the most enjoyable part of the book, candidly pointing out the book's faults but arguing for its continued value, as it imagines Carol's experience being like that of a young Hillary Rodham first arriving in Little Rock. Suffice to say I had a lot more fun reading it than I did the rest of this book 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 I thought "Silver Pigs" was wonderful. By this one, Falco is tiresome, trite and boring. The humourous cynicism present in the earlier novels seems to be both studied and begrudging in the later ones. And the family is NOT that cute. Still, there are a few flashes of humour. If Falco would ditch the extended family, Davis would tighten up the writing and not be quite so coy, this series could be salvaged. Davis should take a few lessons from John Maddox Roberts and Decius 
 This compilation completely misses the point of ELO.   I've casually disliked this band for about 25 years, so I should know. They weren't real. Or significantly unreal, for that matter. Yet there was a time in the mid-to-late seventies when ELO meant something to me. When the songs and I were somewhere between boy and man . . .   "Live at Winterland 1976" shows that they were a studio band at heart and that Jeff Lynne wasn't a singer so much as a good in-the-studio vocals (and whatever else) manipulator.   Still, when in that studio and left to his own devices, manipulating whatever, wanking whenever, isolating the flotsam amid the gism (sorry, jetsam), and floating on his personal dream of music, he--like any boy in the same situation--sometimes hit the jackpot.   However messy, the first time was one of the best, as sometimes happens to the more fortunate of us. 'Do Ya' proved he was experienced, or experienced enough to convincingly sound like he was. Link Wray, Ray Davies and Dave Davies (with Jimmy Page looking over his shoulder), Lou Reed, Pete Townshend, and others could have cited paternity, but they had their own woodpiles to contend with.   Lynne really broke out in a sweat with "Eldorado": "A Symphony By The Electric Light Orchestra." A "symphony," no less. Although it expressed only too well the source of his inspiration, as well as the limitations of his performance ability, 'Can't Get It Out of My Head' is as romantic as a boy can get. 'Boy Blue' was the natural and, eh, deserved follow-up.   Lynne listened to his own tune and heard himself revealed . . . He wrote his best album as a result. "Face the Music" he did, and as many reviewers will tell you, dark it was. Yet that very personal confrontation, coupled with honest adolescent feeling (cf. 'Evil Woman'), produced an album of songs that a romantic seems to come up with only once in his lifetime (girls know better). 'Fire on High,' 'Waterfall,' 'Poker,' and 'One Summer Dream' are stand-out tracks, but, incredibly, the others are about as memorable. The story of a boy's night out.   Having revealed his soul, he didn't know what to do with it, so he sold it. "A New World Record" cashed in, with the best song, 'Do Ya,' being anything but new, or living. (He'd already did, I'd thought.) A trivial album covering up lost innocence with as much hoopla as the 20th century, or Leni Riefenstahl, could muster.   His soul gone, with nowhere to go, Lynne did what he knew best. He went back to that there studio, shut out the world, and wanked as hard as he could for a new revelation. And he was granted one: Home might as well be outer space, and rainy days are nice. In perhaps his best song of all, 'Summer and Lightning,' he's all alone, with no one else to mess things up. The title of the album, "Out of the Blue," isn't quite as honest as "Golden Shower of Hits" (Circle Jerks) would have been, but for an olio of boyhood remembered, the songs have their charms.   And that was it for the next few decades. There really was nothing left for Lynne to say.  (He sure did help other guys express themselves though, boy howdy: 'Free Fallin',' 'Got My Mind Set On You,' 'Handle With Care,' 'You Got It' . . .)   "All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra" includes none of the above-mentioned songs, except for 'Evil Woman.'   Instead, you get 'Xanadu' without Olivia Newton-John.   At least Rush made Xanadu seem important. But then Neil Peart had read Coleridge's poem, even if he is Canadian . . . Peart, that is. Not Coleridge. Who's British. Took laudanum, an opium derivative.   Speaking of which . . . Afghanistan is producing bumptious crops of the stuff these days. Flesh and blood must make good fertilizer. Perhaps Lynne could take a trip and refuel his personal fantasies. If you can't get out of your head, you might as well stay there. Enjoy the view. Write songs for the boy in so many of us. I'll relive my youth, or the part of it that I can half remember, with the tunes he's capable of writing--I'll give Lynne some credit. Which, really, is saying a lot.   And we're back to where we started.  
 Good for Sheryl Crow. She's a middling musical talent who was fortunate enough, more than any other reason, to be in the right place at the right time. Good for her for using a group of guys and their music as a launching pad for her career, even swiping their unofficial name for the title of her debut album. I'm sure she has a lot of personal charisma and she must be a doll in person, because the music on her self-titled sophomore album (which could more accurately be seen as a debut) is severely lacking. Nothing on this record comes close to the best songs on TNMC (basically, the hits - which I still dig -- like most people, I'm entitled to my contradictions).   Sheryl Crow is a shameless commercial, dare I say, corporate artist. All about the moolah (- but really, what isn't?). Good for her; I'd love to be as rich as she is and I suppose I'd sacrifice a lot to get there. Hope she's making millions from those painfully annoying car commercials. No, I'm not impressed by the myriad artists, the undeniable talent she's written and performed with - still think it all comes down to the money; plus I have the right to like certain peoples' music regardless of who they associate themselves with . . .  Of course, what this all comes down to is the music itself. And this-y-heeeaaar album reeeaaally gets on my nerves. The lazy-yet-spasmodic outburst of, "If it makes you haaaappiieee!!!" alone is enough to turn my stomach. I'll admit there's the occasional Sheryl Crow song I like (I'm trying to be objective here), such as "On the Outside" (which, by the way, I have on the "X-Files" soundtrack - the only SC I currently own). Sheryl Crow has made some servicable pop music from time to time over the years, but please don't put this album on in my presence. Sometimes an artist's overall despicability and general lameness outweighs one's ability to like whatever's good about 'em.   You go gurl 
 I enjoy reading and listening to Ravi...however, if one is serious about theology and apologetics...this is not the book.  There are many who have written down to Ravi concerning this work, and some of their comments may be warranted.  What may be at point here is not that Ravi has some solid interior insights, but rather the presentation of his philosophy/faith.  As an avid student of theology and apologetics, I found his book at a loss for deep penetration.  Many Protestants in particular may find profit from the book due to their inclinations and history of anti-intellectualism and subjectivism of interpreting Christ, but there are Catholic theologians whom address the ideas of this book in a much deeper and real sense.  I doubt many who have reviewed this book have read a St. Thomas Aquinas, who took Aristotle's works and lofted them to the heavens.  St. Aquinas is but one of the great Catholics who have wrote of the One true God.  One reviewer had the impetus to quote the Catholic Encyclopedia...I challenge this reviewer to read some of the great Saints and see if he or she still thinks Hinduism/Buddhism are on par with Catholic (Christian) beliefs of God.  Do not be taken in by pop/new-age pluralism...their followers are as Thomas Merton writes "Birds of Appetite".  Ravi is on track, he just may have wrote to a common denominator that deep seekers are beyond in their present state.  
 I was sent something I did not order. I order the "Sinbad Summer Jam I" and the supplier switched the shipment to something they had in stock. Probably will never use service again 
 Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites.  Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.  I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision 
 After seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast, Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts.  But I have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well?  My reasons for asking, the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie.  Over and over in this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was thirteen, yet in the original film Selena, Alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured.  Since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school, also she looked pretty mature for thirteen.  Then there's Selen'as boyfriend (whose name escapes me at the moment) in the original film he stood by her, through the murder charges, the revelation of the rape, and the miscarriage, yet in the sequel I'm suppose to buy that he couldn't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else.  Then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of Selena, yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast?  I have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door. It was all too obvious that the original film wasn't taken into account when writing the sequel.  Not credible at all 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 Director:  John McTiernan Cast:  John Travolta, Connie Nielsen, Samuel L. Jackson, Timothy Daly, Giovanni Ribisi, Brian Van Holt, Taye Diggs, Dash Mihok, Christian de la Fuente, Roselyn Sanchez, Harry Connick Jr. Running Time:  98 minutes Rated R for violence and language.  John McTiernan's (the mastermind behind "Die Hard") "Basic" opens up in a rain-drenched Panama jungle at night on an Army training mission headed by Sergeant West (Samuel L. Jackson). Flash forward to the next day. An Army chopper picks up two men from the training mission, one injured and one very much alive. The injured man, Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi), is sent to a hospital, and the alive man, Dunbar (Brian Van Holt) is sent in for questioning by the very sexy and very Southern Osborne (Connie Nielsen). Dunbar refuses to speak to anyone except a Ranger. So in comes Ranger Tom Hardy (John Travolta) to piece together the events surrounding the death of Sgt. West and his team.  Most of the film takes place at night, during a rainy hurricane, and adds to the nonexistent plot. What is so intriguing is that the plot isn't really there, but the writer tries to manifest one, and we feel as if we are staring at some nonexistant, material wad of words and flashbacks and images thrown together in a blender, the writer hoping for it to come out smelling of roses.    The writer of "Basic", James Vanderbilt (whose screen crudentials consist of "Darkness Falls"), has so many twists and turns that the film is impossible to keep up with. It becomes hard to seperate present from past and what's real from what's not. So many revelations happen that the audience will feel they are in the middle of the writer's mind, as he comes up with new ideas and tries to squeeze them in time after time after time. There is a limit to how many times you can use "surprise" revelation endings. Vanderbilt uses three of four in a row, piled on top of each other, time after time after time. Just as we think the plot twists are done, and we start to smile because we think we might finally understand the basis of the plot, something else happens, and we zoom in suspensefully on John Travolta's face as he, along with the audience, realizes something.  The performances of Basic's cast are a mixed bag: Travolta is watchable as usual, and he brings a believable sense of self-assured cool to Hardy, but he is frustratingly unable to contain his hammy instincts. The quality of a Travolta performance appears to be inversely proportional to the volume of his voice.  When he's quiet, he's very good; when he yells, he quickly becomes a cartoon. This movie has enough credibility problems; it doesn't need a cartoon hero.  If Travolta is mixed news, Connie Nielsen is plain bad. It's not so much that she can't seem to make heads or tails of the convoluted story - heck, no one can. But she seems less to be stymied than just exceptionally stupid. The scenes that are supposed to establish romantic tension between her and Travolta fall laughably flat. To top it off, she is saddled with some Hollywood nimrod's notion of a Southern accent, which blinks on and off like a turn signal. The smaller roles, though, fare much better. Van Holt as the prisoner does especially well, flavoring his defiance with feral intelligence. There is also nice work by Taye Diggs as the unit's misfit and Tim Daly (where has he been since "Wings" folded?) as the base commander. The most memorable, though (and you sort of knew this already) is Jackson. He has the lunatic drill instructor bit down pat, and delivers it with relish. His is the one character in Basic who is supposed to be larger than life, in part because he is seen in flashback, which means that we are seeing not the man himself, but other people's impressions of him. In his commando sweater and poncho thrown over one shoulder like a warlord's cape, he looks twenty feet tall and invincible. Still, one of Jackson's great talents is his ability to project nuance and smarts to even the most unsubtle characters. His Sgt. West is the shadow leaning over the whole incident, and the movie would have been smart to take more advantage of that.  The real disappointment in the supporting cast is the normally talented Giovanni Ribisi as the wounded survivor, a hospital-ward weirdo who is supposed to seem mysterious but mostly comes off as jokey and annoying. Ribisi seems to have shoplifted his performance from Gary Oldman in "Hannibal", down to his marble-mouthed line deliveries.  Though "Basic" is shabbily conceived, it is at least presented well by John McTiernan, who manages to wring what tension may be had from the loopy script. The movie is lacking in the action set-pieces McTiernan usually employs, but he nails the atmosphere just right. The use of weather to convey emotion is certainly overdone, but it is still effective when done right, as it is here. The pounding, ever-present rain and the dim, shadow-tinged interior lighting gives the movie the feel of an approaching end, a kind of despairing resignation to horrible things. It's a shame that the drama can't keep up with its own visual metaphor.  It has its merits, but strains your suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point, and washes its credibility away like bloodstains in a rainstorm. 
 Thanks to Walker Percy a manuscript about a rotund medievalist with a pronounced aversion to gainful employment was saved from the dustbin.  Unfortunately, Percy's own works, variations on Russian humbuggery doused in southern discomfort, often slip into an existential coma. The Last Gentleman barely has a pulse. After an engaging opening with a baby who emerges from a hurricane, the novel gets downright tiresome. When examining the limits and conundrums of human freedom, Percy lacks the subtlety of the far superior storyteller Robert Penn Warren. In this instance, Percy's women are insufferably tedious, his men only slightly more amusing. Mr. Vaught induces a grin in seersucker, but the protagonist, a nearly transparent figure known as the engineer, has the charm and presence of an expired june bug. He talks nonsense with a jumbled up girl and, in a fugue state, wanders around for days not knowing his name. After a while, the weary reader prays he'll wander across a busy freeway 
 This is just a warning not to buy the censored version of this album. Make sure you get the proper version.  Tracks 4 and 8 of disc 3 have some horrible noise put on to mask the lyrics, which makes the songs unlistenable. It would have been better not to have put the tracks on the album than to release them in this format.  I would refuse to buy censored music on principle and it is a mystery to me why Prince, who spent years in a dispute with his record company over artistic freedom, should release censored music.   By the way, the music is wonderful and I recommend the album 100%. But make sure you don't buy censored music 
 when I ordered the book there was no indication that it was a study guide, I wanted a textbook and I received a study guide, the add was very misleading.  
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
 I purchased the product, used it for 2 days and it has not worked since.  The compnay has yet to respond to my request for return, and Amazon excepts no liabilty.  Needless to say I wasted money 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 Hard as it is to do, this film manages to make Jet Li look very, very bad. I kept having Karate Kid flashbacks! The story is the same old, same old, American martial arts move cliches, fighting for honor and all...in a place that is obviously NOT Los Angeles. The real disappointment is that the martial artists( in come cases obviously just local students for God sake!) are sub par and the choreography suffers for it. The action sequences are slow and awkward. Pass on this one guys 
 Who lives outside in barns, begging for food? Well, in a book called The Midwife's Apprentice, Alyce, aslo known as Dung or Brat does. Since she is starving, she asks people for jobs she can do. Aluce finally convines a midwife, called Jane, to give her a job. Alyce also tells Jane if she works, she wants food in return. Jane agrees to the deal, and that's when Alyce journey begins.   I didn't really like this book since it was boring. Even though the book was dull, I think Karen Cushman did a good job of expressing emotions of the characters, like when boys called Alyce names. I also feel a connection to the book. When Aluce didn't do an important assignment, she felt ashamed. I  feel ashamed when I don't do something important properly. Karen Cushman has also written other books like Catherine Called Birdy. Really, I wouldn't reccomend this book to to anybody since it was boring. But I think people could learn from the moral of the story: which is hard work pays of.   
 The book is full of useless fillings. Finding your colors is limited to few hair and eye color combinations. It also depends on you doing a test with different colored fabrics & determing how the color reflect against your skin. After reading the book, I still don't know what my colors are. Besides, with so many different color hues on the market, how can one tell if what you're buying is an ever green or true green for example, confusing. The lack of pictures showing the types of collars they're recommending for different body types (e.g Mandarin collar,cowl,bardot...)...is annoying,to say the least. Questionnaires are poorly structured, & the section on makeup, underwear & accessories is trivial. Save your money (i'm glad the book I read was a borrow from the library) and save your time. Pass 
 I loved this when it came out, but I also loved lots of things then that weren't good for me. Not that this is harmful in any way... it's just that it is really, really awful.  Lemmy is the only one in the band that could play with any facility or sense of melody, and even he wasn't exactly at his best then. The drummer is an unsteady, two-lick metronome, and Dave Brock continuously uses a wah pedal on his guitar solos to try to cover up for the fact that he sounds like he's playing with his toes. Overlay it all with undifferentiated sonic sludge, add a flute/reed player who seems to have never learned half the notes on either instrument, and sprinkle with "cosmic" lyrics that weren't so much goofy as stupid - that was Hawkwind.   Don't buy the hype. Hawkwind was always terrible, if terribly sincere. They were a joke then, and if you pay what they're asking for this idiocy, the joke's on you. Want space rock? Buy Gong, or even Planet Gong, not this mud 
 This book covers a huge range of Irish names, however only provides minimal information on each and coat of arms for the select few.  It provided the same information that is easily found on the web 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 I bought this book thinking it would be a great coffee-table book for my theatrical home.  I even thought I could use it for trivia games with my theatre students.  But it only focuses on 10 movies - one for each chapter.  And the trivia questions are for people who are obsessed with that particular film.  I was hoping for a book full of fun, random questions about a wide array of movie musicals, but this book is not that.  However, if you've watched Wizard of Oz 50 times, this would be the perfect book for you 
 Beware of this product.  It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer.  I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly.  I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy 
 I'm not surprised that many of the reviewers here gave the books such high marks.  Their reviews, much like the book, are littered with misspellings and other inaccuracies.  Perhaps we can blame this on the evil Conservative Right-Wing establishment known as our education system....oh, wait....it's largely Liberal?  Holy cow.  Oh, sorry, a religious reference.  Shame on me 
 I ordered this book and eventually amazon cancelled the order because it was not available.  The then ask me to review it?  Where is it?  Rev bruce 
 A more appropriate subtitle for this book is "A NEWLY CONTRIVED History of the Western World"  As another reviewer here states Osborne comes down hard on Western Civilization. This includes America, as well as many other regimes and occurrences that truly shaped Western Civilization. Osborne adoringly praises the Greeks, like Plato, who, oddly enough he acknowledges devised and advocated an artless society of dictatorship run by elitist philosophers in his book "The Republic", and Osborne ignores how the Greek concept of an earth-centered universe crippled Western thought for well over a millennium. Yet, these things don't bother Osborne who instead willfully praises the Greeks and besmirches the great entities, like Rome or America that had enormous influence on the world stage.   He lambastes Rome for being aggressive and for building an empire based upon their beliefs of what they considered "civilization", and with an ignorant swipe of his hand, Osborne wipes away centuries of colossal influence, which have truly shaped our modern world. You cannot condemn an entire civilization for making some mistakes. Britain, America, Australia have all engaged in conquest, as has all other major regimes, yet he innocently expects no violence to occur to effect those huge changes, as if the American Indians, or Aborigines peoples would have said, "Hi pale-faced strangers, here, take all of our land. We'll just leave peacefully. No problem." This is the idyllic type of nonviolent world that Osborne believes exists in reality. Any rational mind knows otherwise.  These acts were not humane in one respect, but were crucial in another, since any race that feels that they must fight to ensure their ideologies and ultimate survival inevitably must do so, or risk annihilation themselves. Nation building is always an ugly business, and history shows that there are always winners and always losers. It's an ugly fact that must be understood and put into context. Mr. Osborne, as well as millions of us Americans would not exist today if our forefathers lost that struggle for survival, and that is the reality often overlooked by authors who sit in their comfortable office or studio not realizing that the blood of their ancestors secured their comfortable lifestyle and their very existence.  Therefore, nation building requires a strong ideology, determination, unity and, yes, blood. Its unfortunate, but it's a reality of life that directly affects not some, but all histories of mankind. The important issue is did these regimes make positive influences, or did they only thrust their conquered territories into poverty, chaos or unremitting suppression? It's a given that some always suffer, but the majority of people in these new regimes did prosper, and did create and generate much positive influence that overshadows these unfortunate side effects, or casualties. Nothing is perfect, and every issue has two sides, which need to be weighed carefully, but knowledge of that other side is mandatory. Yet, Osborne only focuses on these negative side effects.  Other absurdities abound, as he lambastes the Italian Renaissance, clearly demonstrating how occurrences outside the realm of his understanding can be crucial to world history. Certain areas of endeavor, which may seem trivial to some, do affect influence and change in profound ways, and Osborne unfortunately fails to see this. Although he does purport some good and true historical facts, and has a very nice writing style, this book cannot be taken seriously in total. It is not well rounded, nor is it truly accurate. I was expecting a concise, but accurate, portrayal of Western history, but the many erroneous conclusions asserted by the author make this a very distorted and unjust view of the greatest civilizations to ever grace this planet.  Hence, my suggestion is to seek other authors, otherwise those who are uniformed about history will fall victim to Osborne's alien and anemic views 
 I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting.  I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good 
 I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening!  I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me.  I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool.  But, the description said it was trimmed in geniune "pig skin" leather.  When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag.  The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell.  It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen!  I couldn't believe that Amazon was selling this product for $200!  I love Amazon and everything they have to offer!  They really shouldn't put there name behind this product anymore.  Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step!  I know I was!!!  
 I am a decades-long lover of Southern Living publications. Whether we buy the magazines, the cookbooks, or the home products, many of us count on Southern Living for unsurpassed quality and creativity.  I am extremely disappointed with "Christmas with Southern Living 2005". This edition marks the 25th Anniversary of this regularly phenomenal book. I can hardly believe this belongs in the same category as the volumes from previous years.   Certainly, the color photography remains true to form, wonderfully presented. But it's the sheer lack of creative craft ideas, and the fewer number of quality recipe ideas that mar this normally fantastic book. I was expecting a five-star product for the silver anniversary - what I fear I've received is far below what SL should have offered.  I expect CwSL 2006 to make up for what 2005's edition was lacking - this company will most certainly not let us down again. I'll continue to buy Southern Living books without hesitation - and with excitement! I'm simply disappointed that the 2005 book will find its way to the back of the bookcase 
 Buy this if you want to purchase every book on this subject, or buy The Concierge Manual for $15 more and you won't need to look any further 
 Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite. The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game 
 Regina Herzlinger's "focused factories" of tomorrow are the "centers of excellence" of the 1980s.  Both concepts are fine for metropolitan areas but ignore several important facts:  1. 80% of health care resources are consumed by 20% of the population, the elderly and very young;  2. There are about millions of people who neither live in areas large enough to support such "factories" and lack the financial means to travel to them.  3. Consumers are concerned largely with price and convenience, and secondarily with outcome.  They have no basis by which to compare technologies (such as mammogram machines, as she suggests).  4. Patients aren't paying the bills.  Consumerism isn't a panacea.  Patients have no idea what health care truly costs, equating cost with price.  Physicians haven't been  much help either, since they lack sound business sense and have been shielded from market sources for decades.  The "solutions" at the end of the book appear to have been pasted together to meet a deadline instead of being carefully constructed with adequate supporting arguments.  It is reminiscent of the cartoon of two scientists next to a blackboard covered with equations, one of which is "and then a miracle occurs."  Finally, Herzlinger made the same mistake as Hillary Clinton.  Physicians are not about to accept changes in their system made without their input.  Ultimately, they still deliver the product and, unless one can figure out how to construct a health care system sans physicians, one must include them in any talk of reform.  David A.

 I'm not sure what happened with this book. It almost appears as if it was written and published without any proofreading.   Questions that are listed (with an A, B, C, or D response) to help you learn the material, have incorrect response letters associated with the answer. Not exactly what you want when you're prepping for a certification!  Even though the Charles River Media web site lists the corrections, there are many other inconsistencies in the book that aren't listed on the web site, especially in the TCP/IP section which is a large portion of the 70-271 exam.  To prepare for the exam, I purchased this book and a MeasureUp practice test (which had 150 questions and was very beneficial). I passed the exam but would not have if I had solely relied on this resource.  The book does cover the material that you will find on the exam, but due to the many inconsistencies, I can not recommend it. It will leave you feeling unconfident and unsure. There are just too many errors 
 My family (who is entirely CUBAN) sat around reading the recipes of this book and began to laugh.  I mean, what REAL Cuban cooks a steak in Olive Oil???  We also DO NOT eat gazpacho...that is a Latin American dish...not Cuban...why is it in a Cuban Cook Book?  I was not impressed with the book and am returning it in hopes that I find something more authentic and true 
 As a mom of an 8 yo with Asperger's, I am always looking for new ways to help my son.  This book just wasn't helpful to me.  It could be my son's ADHD makes his issues so much different than those she addressed.  I just didn't find anything in there to help him so I didn't bother finishing it.  I borrowed it from the library and for that I am thankful.  
 Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star.  I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.  I'm glad this product was cheap, because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought.  Everytime I swing on it, I feel it creak and wobble. I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.  It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser.  I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.  Don't buy this product if your plus size.  If your not plus size, go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing.  If your are of plus size, order THE BEAN full body (I just did) 
 A subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball "nuts" who grew up in New York.   We idolized the terribly tarnished CCNY "Wonder Five" who set an unbreakable record by winning both the NIT and NCAA titles in 1950 (it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled). This book is a fictional addendum to Rosen's non-fiction treatment of the original basketball "scandals", as he outlines in his NPR interview. Unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors -- Broadway and 43rd Street cannot be on the east side of Manhattan; Madison Square Garden has been on 23rd Street, and is now above Penn Station; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues.  These errors are particularly galling in a book by a New Yorker who played at Hunter College, and they undermine the author's credibility and care in writing. Since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence, the game of who is this really is inescapable.  Hence it is most unfortunate that Rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers, and "a couple are in the Hall of Fame."  This tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as Bob Cousy (Holy Cross, '49), Dick McGuire (St. Johns, '48), Bobby Wanzer (Seton Hall, '46), and Frank McGuire, the legendary coach at St. John's, North Carolina and South Carolina 
 I think this movie is so incredibly contrived and just so damn cutesy I don't know why it has gotten so much critical acclaim, especially about how it's all just so devastatingly human despite everyone acting like a cartoon character?  But being in a liberal arts college I have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following.  The characters and the situations remind me of the short stories I would write in the sixth grade when I was around 12 years old, where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb, absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you're wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating, inane nonsense.  The whole movie feels like ones 12-year-old self trying to write about adult problems that they're distanced from yet infatuated by.  This movie appeals to the type of people who like to read Catcher and the Rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their chain-smoking, wannabe-depressed but more like "I'm so sad 'cause I don't have a girlfriend" indie-rocker lives into some sort of literary wellspring.  I think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing, it's unfortunate he can't just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic "subtle" messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say.  Hipster drivel - look for something else to watch 
 In the Introduction, Arthur Benavie tries very hard to make the case that this book offers a fair and balanced analysis of Social Security reform.  It does not.  Chapters 1 and 2 are designed to present the cases for and against privatization of Social Security.  In Chapter 1 (Fixing Social Security) he presents the case for saving the system through a long list of tax increases and benefit reductions.  The opposing side of the argument is not presented at all.  In Chapter 2 (Should We Privatize Social Security?), he starts out by presenting as many cons as he does pros for the privatization point of view.  For every item he describes what the supporters of privatization espouse, he provides a rapid response in attempt to discredit the idea.  By dedicating one chapter each to the "higher taxes/lower benefits" and the "privatization" viewpoints, he must think he is being "balanced".  Bottom line...this book is advertised as a balanced analysis of Social Security reform.  But it comes down clearly on the side of being against any reform designed to privatize a portion of Social Security.  This may be a good book for you if you want to read an author make the case against privatization of Social Security.  If you want to truely understand the trade-offs associated with privatization, this book will be a big letdown 
 I bought it because I had heard it was a good flick! Well after watching it I gave it to my brother. Save your money 
 this was certainly not one of Cornwell's best works.  IT was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one.  It read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel 
 Lang Lang's powerful and fast fingers just do not work for Chopin.  Chopin's music is as dedicated as "dancing with soul" for every note.  Lang Lang's fingers are just too rude to interpret these subtle notes.  For Mazart Concerto, if you have listened to Horowitz, you will be disappointed with Lang Lang's recording too.  I don't even want to mention the rest recordings.  As I know Lang Lang performs over 120 shows a year.  He is talented and successful at his age. Yet he should spend more time on music itself and understand the virtue of difference. Beyond technical fast fingers, expression is all counts at last 
 This book really wasn't for me.  It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre.  Although, it might be useful to the right person.  I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books.  The book reads a lot like the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance.  On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief 
 I eagerly awaited this Cd/book set but was disappointed in what it actually delivered about its subject matter.  The companion book text was beautifully rendered but it was almost entirely a compilation of informational "bits" from other sources, that might be inspiring for the beginner but are pretty unsubstantial if you are looking for technique. Good for beginners but the serious practitioner will need more.  Russill Paul's works are far more informative and his Sanskrit pronunciations (pronunciation being VERY important when healing with sound) are correct 
 I read this book because my mother and father, a career soldier, were married shortly before World War II, after knowing each other only 3 months. I hoped this book would offer me some interesting insights. But trust me, this book has no insights to offer. The vignettes are too short and most seem incomplete; further, they are repetitious and shallow, and the whole book is poorly written. Do not waste your time. Instead, spend it finding one of the really good books on WWII; there are plenty out there. Larry King must be spreading himself too thin these days 
 I think Arnold's philosophy was: "Use as little periods as possible. Who needs 'em when you have a host of commas, semicolons, colons, dashes--indeed, an assortment of methods to elongate your sentences." I pride myself on my reading ability, but this book was just too much. I have only encountered two books that I could say this about, and the other one (Book of the Wars of the Lord: Volume 1--Immortality of the Soul) is within my grasp--indeed, if I had a lot of time, I could definately tackle it. This book, on the other hand, uses so much complicated languages and elongated sentences that I got completely lost. My criticism isn't directed at Arnold (after all, such a writing style was almost expected in the Victorian era), but just at the fact that this is not a good book. While I may be wallowing in my ignorance (I notice that about every other reader gave this 4-5 stars), I don't see how one can stay awake for so long 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 Another movie using actresses seemingly straight out of soft porn. It's fun to watch them die onscreen sure, but it's redundant. I'm not surprised to read it's by the Shark Attack people. They're terrible too, but of course if they make a #4, I will rent it knowing it will be stupid. <sigh&gt 
 This book is a poor substitute for Thomas Sugrue's "Origins of the Urban Crisis." More sensational and less objective, Holloway's weak prose add very little to the important discourse on the fall of Detroit. At best, this book should be considered a supplement (with its unique sources) to more rigorous and thoughtful writings 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie. The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be 
 Just borrowed it from a friend. Anti-arabism in a pseudo-intellectual wrapping.We need a balanced book on the subject 
 This is a five CD book.  The author does not actually begin discussing the battle until well into the FOURTH CD.  Need I say more 
 The beats on this record are repeatitive and the rhymes lack the creativity for the most part that you expect out of Kool Keith. This is a tough record to listen to in its entirety because of the thick monotony of the music.   The best songs are the Sex songs, and if that is the primary reason you like Keith's work than maybe its worth checking out. If you're looking for some of his new stuff to hear, I'd recommend Disel Truckers before the Lost Masters. 
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 I give the first part of the story a 4 and a zero to the second - in fact, I didn't even finish the book - I simply didn't care what happened to them or the treasure. I enjoyed the first two characters -- Eve and Roarke bore me to tears - or at least, Eve does. I don't like female characters who flaunt the fact that they have bigger (you know whats) than the men in her world -- she's turning Roarke into a whimp! I've read 75% of Robert's books, but I think I'm through with Roberts/Robb - she's done her story formula to death 
 I was very exited to see this book because I love photographing waterfalls and on the surface the books looks very informative. However this book suffers from one huge flaw. The directions on how to get to the first three of the falls we tried to locate were very vague or flat out imposable to follow. Both my wife and I became very frustrated trying to locate the waterfalls we chose to visit from the book. In the end we did find one of the three falls we were looking for, but that had more to do with a GPS unit and expert hiking skills. Still I would recommend this book, because there is no other guides like for the area. Just check the directions online before leaving for a set of falls 
 Got this as an X-mas present. Seems my MIL thought that our current Uniden DCT648-3 took to long to sound the message tone (30 Seconds after the machine message finishes)was bad!  So she got us this one. Well after 8 days the phone would no longer connect to the phone line. The screen flashes "connecting" for about 10 seconds then displays "unable to connect". Tried different hand sets on the base, same result! Tried different cables, still the same!  So I plugged the Uniden DCT648-3 back in and all is well except the lag time on the recorder. What the hell I like this one it displays the time and is a clear as a bell when talking 
 I was disappointed in this book. The photos of the altered patterns are sometimes frustratingly small, and often it is not clear exactly what aleration was done to the pattern piece. In addition, some of the fitting advice is not very good. For example, if you have a wide base of neck, simply making the collar circumference larger will not improve the fit, because you do not have a thick neck--only the base of the neck needs to be accomodated. This book would be suitable for beginning sewists, but it will not satisfy people with advanced sewing and fitting skills 
 This is one of the ONLY books by Nora Roberts I can actually say I didnt like. It was SO dissapointing I got mad everytime I looked at it. This books is about Oliva and Noah... THE END. That is practically what it is. It started off when they were both younger, them meeting when they were older and them meeting YET AGAIN WHEN THEY ARE MATURE. I guessed the story RIGHT from the beginning, and I hardly could ever do that before in any of Nora Robert's books. I hate to say it, but I DONT reccomend this book. It was really waste of time. What happened to the quality work of Ms. Roberts 
 Only the most die hard Heinlein fans would want to read this. On the other hand, I think most die hard Heinlein fans who read it will wish they hadn't. This is not good, and is a disservice to his legacy 
 This is a good phone, except it has one major flaw which makes it unusable. First off, a minor flaw is that it is hard to pick up the reciever as it is locked in there, I don't like that. Another flaw is that while you are picking up and putting back the phone, it makes a VERY high and LOUD screaming pitch. This makes it almost deafening for someone on another phone in the house. This phone will be going back ASAP because it is unusable. Stay away from this phone at all costs 
 I'm a German teacher, and this is one of the most-loved books ever, but the translation in this particular edition is outdated and full of errors.  (For example, the "sallow wood" in the first sentence is an outright mistake on the translator's part, it's really supposed to be a "forest of sal trees" - that's a kind of tree that's common in India.)  There are a few more recent translations out there that are better.  I like the one by Susan Bernofsky best, but there are others to pick from as well 
 Although all the other reviews simply rave about this 2 CD set, and "This CD set was awarded a rosette by the Penguin Guide to Compact Discs", I just listened to both CDS.  Very very disappointed.  The music is very bland, no passion, very passive. I could not believe what I was hearing.  Anytime I see ASMITF as the orchestra playing Mozart, I usually am pleased..but this time I was not.  I am sticking with Mitsuko Uchida (pianist) and Mr. Tate (conductor)...for her playing of the Mozart concertos.. 
 Save you money! This isn't really suitable for anyone who cares what their children read. Much, much better can be found elsewhere 
 this movie, i bought for 10 bucks after hearing various praises on how cool it is....and several ideas come up after watching this. first, the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew could have made this a more fun of a watch...especially the scene with the light and spinal cord sword fight. next, the whole movie seemed fit to have industrial goth music playing in the background...i mean, i could easily enjoy this movie a little more with some KMFDM, Marilyn Manson, NIN, etc playing in the background. it seriously reminded me of uninteresting, choppy and hard to follow versions of the Mortal Kombat Movies.  although, some things are trippy/dreamy...which is worthy of 2 stars.  the movie itself is too typical...guy has a mission, innocent little kid is the key to the story, some supernatural battle....and everything is too choppy....not to mention the whole vampire thing turned me off more.  id recommend a pass or rent 
 Don't bother with this unfunny, predictable, boring, pedestrian, fingerpainted drivel.  The piggy stole the show 
 This novel starts out okay, but rapidly deteriorates into a maudlin melodrama of cardboard characters.  After I began reading this, I thought it seemed very formulaic compared to other Ludlum novels.  My biggest problems with the book can be put into two basic categories:  One - The man with no name who is too dangerous to let go.  This theme is well done with Jason Bourne, but far too commonplace here. Several times I felt that if the main character was this well trained, he never would have pursued his course of action.  Two - The reasonable female.  The girl is far too willing to accept really bad things here.  No convincing is needed - just imply cloak and dagger and the girl falls in line.  I started out liking the book - but ended up hating it 
 I cannot give a point-by-point critique of the book, however a good peek into the composition of the book came when the author appeared on the radio show Air Talk.  When a professor profiled in the book claimed his profile had innacuracies, Horowitz HIMSELF admitted the profile was written by someone whom he himself did not know.  This is the author himself saying that the book he claims to have written contains elements he cannot vouch for because he did not write them and has no idea who did.  This is sloppiness that calls any other fact in the book into question.  Is a particular write up on a professor a fair perspective or revenge by someone who got a 'D'.  We really can't tell if the author admits he did no real fact checking 
 Like many others who have reviewed this movie, I can say that I am a huge fan of Colin Firth and Minnie Driver.  Why they are in this poorly written, poorly edited movie is beyond me.  Heather Graham is perfectly cast for this B movie; her acting abilities are on a par with the rest of what is going on here.  The characters are flat, many of them are just poor characterizations (Mary Steenburgen is just embarassing as the hotel manager with the fake Maine accent....painful to watch.) and they are all unbelievable.    I watched it all the way through and wished I hadn't. Save your money and get this one out of the library if you have to try it out 
      Lila Mae Watson, a psychic elevator inspector is the unlikely protagonist in The Intuitionist.  This unique character uses her intuition rather than technical expertise to sniff out faulty mechanical systems.  When Lila Mae makes a mistake, it's a big one with elevators crashing to earth and riders ending up in little pieces.  Mixed results, is the best we can say about both her methods and the book in general.  Although the concept of a psychic elevator inspector sounds interesting the story is not.  The Intuitionist becomes bogged down in tedious details and an incomprehensibly complicated plot line. The author promises to take the reader on an imaginative romp, unfortunately he fails to deliver.  Colson Whitehead's debut novel is strictly recommended for insomniacs 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 If you buy Storeys Guide to Raising Chickens then do not bother with this book it is just an excerpt from his other book word for word 
 many students in my class newly perchased this book less than 5 months ago, and within 2 months of barly any use, many students were complaining that the book's bindings were falling apart! almost all of the class's books were falling apart. also, many of the chapters have hundreds of vocab words, but many of the vocab words are repeated and repeated! it is nice that the book gives both simplified and traditional characters, but the grammar examples and the homework exercises are only done in simplified...which is a real pain if you only know traditional. 
 I find it fascinating that publishers aren't catching on that nutritionists don't make food that's in the ballpark of chefs.  If you want a healthy cookbook, buy one from a trained chef who specialized in healthy food.  This is a perfect example.  Good idea, terrible execution (meaning the finished dishes leave much to be desired). 
 As other reviewers have said, this book is extremely short. It barely covers the topics, certainly not in depth. If all you wanted is this tiny bit of information, you would be better off doing some web searches. It's not worth the 8+ dollar cost, not even close. If you want an excellent book I would go with MouthSounds by Fred Newman. It's an excellent book all around, and includes an audio CD with examples. The book covers all types of whistles more in depth than this book covers two types of whistles as well as many, many other mouth sounds such as other instruments and voices. Stick with MouthSounds and give this book a wide pass 
 This isn't a bad cookbook but it isn't the greatest one either, if you don't buy it you're not missing out on anything except the pictures of Padma. The recipes aren't that difficult and the Indian ones which are her specialty are the best in the book.  For people who aren't the best cooks but want to make some decent Indian dishes, Padma's book is pretty good for that. If I had a dollar for every time she mentions Daniel and her mom, I would be a millionaire...and I could have done without the narratives that are so shallow that you know that they came from the mind of a model. For example, "there I was in a beautiful Chanel gown eating a tuna fish sandwich." Someone please tell Padma her village called, apparently their model is missing. One more thing, all her recipes are available on the food network website FOR FREE 
 This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes.  First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it.  Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business.  Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book.  What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered?  I'll save you $9.72 (+s/h) and the 45 minutes it'll take you to read this.  Here goes... Unless you were raised by wolves, it's pretty likely you've heard of the Golden Rule.  Ok, now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings.  That's it - you got it!    Whew!  Now that you have an extra $9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time, go practice that Golden Rule by treating your kids/grandkids/neighbors to some ice cream 
 I was really disappointed in this book. It was like slogging through a swamp to get back to the same place you started. The story was a really interesting premise, but the discussion of politics and the destinationless and pointless journey bored me.I supposed there is some meaning somewhere in all the molecules of description, but my patience is too far gone to find it. I LOVED the Tale of the Unknown Island because it was direct but slow enough to keep me thinking there was something around the corner. This one just left me hanging 
 I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie.  My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it.  My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting.  It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well.  The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward.  Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there.  Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast.  We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California).  I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself "why?  Why am I wasting my time like this? 
 I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child?   My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT, and she was about 10 months old). She's now 2, fully pt, but will still not go near it. If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old, how would it do under the weight of an older child? Beyond me.  I still give it 2 stars, because it's an otherwise neat idea. Impractical execution, though 
 I love running and I love books about running. I have degrees in the sciences and am a self-confessed nerd, having read about fifty books on training how to run. Of all of these, I found *Better Training for Distance Runners* to be the most frustrating.  There is a degree of scientific complexity matched only by Noakes book *Lore of Running.* Unlike Noakes' book, this one never delivers after slogging through the detailed account of running physiology. There are some isolated bits of information, but the book lacks an integrated perspective on training.   For example, Jack Daniels' book *Daniels' Running Formula* provides a step-by-step development of a training regiment that can be adapted for any competitive runner. In this book, after reading through detailed chapters on physiology I came to the chapter on putting together a training schedule. With great expectation I began to read--only to be severely disappointed. The chapter contained scattered accounts of different types of training, no direction about how much or when such training would be advised, and no guide to practical implementation. Coe's comments often seem to be platitudes or simply recalling what his son did in workouts. I'm not sure the authors really understand the cause and effect relationship between various aspects of training and the resultant changes in running performance.  I guess that this book might be helpful for experts who already know everything about training and can benefit from some of the biological insights. Not being one of those, I found the book both difficult and vague, resulting in a high cost of reading with very low payoff 
 This is a tabloid, so most likely the stories you're reading are not true. Why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that, a rumor 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 Professor Gardner himself is an example of a learned person who has mastery, but lacks understanding. People, including bright persons, do apply their knowledge to reality. They are not all stuck in a time warp where the false values of their childhood control their "understanding."  Lawyers practice law. Physicists do physics. Historians write history.  Where is the gap between mastery and understanding that he opines? May it not be that there are levels of understanding? Is there really an opposition between knowing and understanding? Perhaps for Prof. Gardner, but not, I think, for the rest of us. Those who can think out of the box, so to speak, in their respective fields, the ones who can be creative are a limited number. They help and enlighten us all. Can a teacher show a child that he or she really doesn't understand what he claims to "know"? Of course. Children are malleable. Even adults can be persuaded to revise their thinking by a sufficiently persuasive speaker even if what that speaker proposes is false. We've seen it time and time again. He's riding that old hobby horse that rote learning is destroying society. It's not. It's reformers like Prof. Gardner that are driving sincere educators to despair as they drive more and more dictators of our schools to believe that the education we are giving and have been giving is inadequate through and through, based on too many false premises, and that we are all up a creek intellectually. It's the height of elitism, and hides a deeper lack of understanding 
 I have bought 5 of these crappy pads and all 5 stopped working after a short period.  Buy the Sunbeam 902 Flexible heating pad--much more reliable and useful too 
 How good was this book????  I don't even remember the story line.  I know I read the book and past it along to a friend, but it sure wasn't memoriable.  Sorry folks, your not going to get a rave from me 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 What ever happened to the tight and taut political thriller movies of the sixties? Remember 'Seven Days in May', 'The Parallax View' . Even the original "Manchurian Candidate". Well unfortunately they find no suitable heir to their tradition in this movie. "The Manchurian Candidate" remake provides a great story line and the original provides a great precedent, they even have a great cast of seasoned actors and stars...  But the final result is slow, plodding and whatever tension or mystery is built, and there is not much of that, is plainly dissipated so early that I kept wanting the damn assassination to be over and the hero shot so I could go to bed. I'm not sure if it's bad writing or bad editing to blame but the movie is a real disappointment. I don't think the big name stars will want to remember it either.  The only thing worse are the DVD extras. There are a series of short interviews with a selection of 'pundits', discussing contemporary political challenges. With terrorism and civil liberties under threat this should be a lively discussion. Unfortunately the 'pundits' are all wannabe no bodies with absolutlely nothing valuable to say. To make things worse none of them seem capable of making a logical adult sentence. All vibe and no verbs. The pundits all seemed to reflect the same leftoid point of view too. Nothing wrong with that. I use the term 'leftoid' because I think they are hollow shells, pod people, not real leftists. These "pundits" if anything dumb down the left or liberal position so much that it is must be embarassing for genuine liberals or radicals to watch. I can't see these guys persuading anyone. What a waste. Surely they could have got a few talking heads that could actually talk from across the political spectrum. If not, they shouldn't have bothered 
 I was expecting some valuable information and guidance from this book but what I got instead was an author's approach--generic advice.  I hate to bash a book but there is not much information out there on startups compared to other business areas so authors should really dig deep into the subject and show how it's done.    I have read most startup books and will be writing reviews on them.  Check my other reviews if you want to see the books on startups I recommend.  
 The film I bought at a retail outlet in Spokane WA contains no closed captions!  If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it.  The box should have contained a clear message:  No Closed Captions!  (Parenthetically, Amazon.com's description indicates the film IS Closed Captioned.)    The content of the film is shallow, and it doesn't really address the issues raised in the more fully supported Greenwald film, Walmart, the High Cost of Low Price.  If closed captions are not an issue, however, buy (or rent) *both* films to draw your own conclusion.  Obviously, the truth about Walmart's impact on US cities and third world communities is somewhere between the images presented in these two films.  I found the Greenwald film much more convincing 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 John Morgan has lost himself in such skeptical toughts... In summary, he does not believe in sience, in knowledge, in knowning patterns, in medicine, in neurology, in anything... It adds very little, instead of bad mood. Don't waste your money 
 What they said was that Katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme.  I saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst performer of the night.  The first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say.  Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was "Snowflake."  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.  Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for her to put on record 
 Being in the fire service for nearly 10 years and an instructor, this book does well for individuals with a decent level of fire knowledge.  However, for the fundamental student or beginner fire fighter, this book lacks serious explinations of the basic concepts.  This book has done nothing but confuse students with it's constant bombardment of calculations without providing clear explinations. Outside sources are constantly used to supliment what this book lacks. If it's used for a begining Fire Engineering or as a suppliment book for Fire Behavior, I would recommend it.  But the lack of the fundamentals that it mystically tries to build on, is extremely frustrating and lacks any sort of foundation. Advanced levels - I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 Beginner levels - I'd give it a 1 out of  
 I think there is some high quality writing on this disc and I find 3-4 of the songs to be quite listenable. However, that's the highest compliment I can muster. With the exception of "Now Comes The Night," only b/c I burned it onto a compilation, I haven't listened to this cd since the month it came out. I wasn't looking for a Justin Timberlake-esque album when I picked this up. I just don't dig whatever direction Rob wanted to go in with his solo material. I find the stylistic inconsistency as a hinderance to the album rather than a selling point for his diversity. Next effort please 
 Save your hard earned money and buy the Masterpiece Theatre version by the BBC.  It's faithful to the spirit of Balzac's novel and is extremely well done.  This version is an incoherent mess.  Someone snorted a few lines of coke before making this Eurotrash version ... 
 The book gives a solid base on the different principles of converters and inverters. But I also expected to see ICs included as they were already available back in 1993! A chapter on the influence of different core  materials and their calculation is, in my eyes, missing for this book to be  a complete reference 
 I'm happy for people who can write books. Good for Miss Gardner.  I had to skip page after page after page of this book, too boring. I think publishers should get a grip and spend more time reading what they publish. If they did, maybe disasters like this wouldn't happen so often.   
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 I'm an architect and was very much looking forward to this book as I am a fervent believer that bigger is not better.  I am always searching for good examples of how to do things as efficiently as possible, which produces a better design and ultimately costs less.  People do not need 3000 square feet houses.  I got this book for christmas and am very disappointed. First, the editing is terrible.  There are literally pages that are marked "lower floor plan" & "upper floor plan" which are blank.  Secondly, the majority of these houses are architectural follies.  They are not "houses" in the meaning that most of us mean when we say house.  They are playhouses - art lofts, guest houses, vacation houses, etc.  How we live in a structure for a few hours of pleasurable work each day and how we live in our actual house varies greatly.  How many of us recreate our same lives while we are on vacation?  That is the whole problem with this book.  It should rightly be called "Expensive architectural follies under 1500 square feet."  In reviewing this book there is nothing that will inform you how to live in a smaller space.  There is nothing that will redefine the idea of house.  That being said there are some very nice pavillions.  
 I'm Jewish and I'm from Texas so, I should like this book, right?  WRONG!  None of these characters is likeable and that includes Ruby, the Rabbi's wife.  Since she's the character at the center of this story, that makes it difficult.  She's nosy, pushy, snide, and sneaky.  That's just SOME of her good qualities.  Her friends are even worse.  The "mystery" is far-fetched.  The blurb on the book's cover is very appealing.  It's a shame the book isn't as good as its cover 
 A Shameful Translation  This volume is quite possibly the sloppiest, most disrespectful, and least reliable "translation" of Rilke I have ever seen.   The term "translation" can only be used in the most casual sense for in their notes on translation Barrows and Macy describe a kind of vague new-age method of translation consisting of a kind of collaboration between them and the original, full of interpretation and subjectivity (pg. 35).   At one point they even confess to doing away entirely with the accurate translation of one of the poems in favour of a "metaphorical" translation (pg. 40).   They admit to omitting lines, entire sections of poems, and even collapsing two consecutive poems into one (pg. 41).   Any legitimate and reputable translator would be horrified by these hackneyed techniques.  For example, in the very first poem, one which sets the tone for the whole book, Barrows and Macy, in their foot notes, admit to cutting out the entire last stanza, fully one-third of the first poem because, "it is not as strong as the first two stanzas, especially for the opening poem of The Book of Hours."   Rilke, his editor, and his publisher obviously thought it was strong enough.    The fact of the matter is that Rilke's work is what it is and it is not the translator's place, as any reputable translator knows full well, to make those determinations.   On page 42 of their notes on translation, commenting further on Rilke's supposedly weak writing, they smugly comment, "Since we could not bring him the chicken soup he needed on those long nights [of writing], we have done him the favour of culling."   One wishes they had done him the favour of a reliable and reputable translation instead of rewriting his beautiful and thoughtful original.    
 Some of the continuations of Andre Norton's worlds have been gems, and some of them have been disappointments.  Beast Master's Ark is the worst to date.  The original Beast Master was one of my favorite books, with Norton's classic complexity of phrase, her textured and troubled main character, and her believable yet alien world.  This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of.  The story never generates tension, and there is no climax.  McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough.  There must be some story.  To add insult to injury, there are multiple typos, and some editing mistakes like tense switching that add to the general sense of a book that is not well written.  I am sorry that Andre Norton put her name to this one 
     Carly Simon is a singer I do not like at all, and she does exactly three songs that I like, and one of them is not here: "The Spy Who Loved Me". Her version of "Mockingbird" is so inferior to Toby Keith's it is not even funny. I would recommend only getting one CD of hers to get a few selected songs, and that is it. A complete total waste of money 
 I just got finished reading this book.  It was supposed to answer many of the tough questions regarding Christianity, but it failed to deliver to a large extent.  Honestly I was trying to be open to the idea that atheism could be wrong, but after reading this book I'm even more convinced that it's Christainty that is wrong.  There's no new arguments here, for the existance of god and doesn't answer many of the important atheist's critiques of the theories.  They've all been refuted many, many, many times over.  When will Christains learn when they have been beaten, or at least get some new ideas 
 The first time I used it, I hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods.  My Mom had ordered it from Sharper Image.  She called them and they said the would replace the ball.  They never did.   I have not found a place to order replacement parts.     
 I think the book really is about project management, not programme management.  As a project manager professional I have read numerous project management books and to be honest, I have not learned anything new in this book.  I was looking for a book that would provide a programme manager (former project manager that masters project management techniques) tools & techniques to help with managing a project portfolio.  Furthermore, I found the book to be somehow expensive vs content 
 I purchased this in June 2006. The software on the CD for viewing the jpg files is worthless. The documents included on the CD are in German with no translation. The book consists of a very detailed history of mostly german or dutch slide rule makers. Makers of very specialized rules. I did not find any discussion of makers of standard rules or methods for production of standard slide rules. If you want pictures of slide rules dealing with alcohol, aviation, concrete, artillery or loads and fuel reserve for planes, then this is the book. 
 This book is nothing original (Chariots of the Gods covered some of this before). The author really thinks he is going to be more impressive by quoting some actual scientific facts (like the number of genes we have as opposed to the number a fly has). He also picks on Darwin's theories and talks as if late 20thcentury conventional scientists completely turned against Darwin's theories. Realize this people. Darwin died over 120 yearsa ago. Of course some of the stuff he said about evolution wasn't going to be true. But a hell of a lot of it was. Many conventional scientists now realize Darwin was certainly partially right and furthermore disbelieving a couple of Darewin's many evolutionary theories doesn't mean a scientist is against evolution in general. 
            Showtime certainly is no stranger to exploitation, but their latest attempt to lure in unsuspecting strangers is ridiculous! The most honest thing about this "I want my money back" attempt is how it perfectly reflects the overall bad second season of THE L WORD (I'll save my rant on Showtime's stereotypical portrayal of gay women for "Craig's List.")       I'd like to say that I WANTED to like this CD. I enjoyed last season's L WORD and both of the previous albums from the show. THIS album shows, though, that no matter how many times you tweak a tv's bad theme song, it is still bad. At least twenty of the tracks that appear here are just different versions of Betty's horrendous "The Way We Live" song which opens each episode of Showtime's sapphic show.        Since I prefer last seasons's brief but memorable (AND non-irritating) opener maybe I'm biased. Even so, the other tracks consist of nothing but extremely abbreviated score snippets. Some tracks are nothing more than moans and "tsk" sounds recorded by the EZ girl herself and the ones with promise leave you wanting way more than you should.       "Bette drunk" and "Melvin" are two emotionally pleasing tidbits (originating from episodes centering on a despondent "Bette" played by the talented Jennifer Beals) but flit by so fast you're positive you imagined them. Don't be fooled by the listing of 44 tracks (plus a "bonus"), which average less than a minute each. This is one time when "less" is NOT more.      Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer my music less sleazy and a lot more romantic; after all, when was the last time anyone enjoyed a candlelight dinner to the sounds of "Dry Hump Lover"*?    *=an actual title of one of the pieces on Second Season Session 
 This book was AWFUL - I tried to use it to prepare for the SAT II and was appalled at the out of date questions, as well as the sample tests, which test you on subjects absolutely irrelevent information 
 I spent the extra on this alarm because I wanted a projection feature.  The projection feature lasted 2 weeks.  I also had a wall clock made by LaCrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity.  Save your money, folks.  Hopefully, Amazon will refund my $$ 
 I saw this movie in the theater and still don't really know what it's actually about. I have to say though, that if you rank this "film" as a comedy, then it deserves 5 stars, sadly, I'm pretty certain that Uwe Boll didn't mean it as such (though i'm sure he would say otherwise). Despite this movie being as bad as it is, I have to say that it made for one of the best movie going experiences that I have ever had, the consesus of the viewing audience was that this movie was so bad, that noone minded one bit when everyone in the theater started heckling it out loud in Mystery Science Theater fashion. The movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like  "don't be insane!" and virtually every word to come out of Tara Reid's mouth, but the best part came when one of the characters called out for their lost friend Marco and literally 5 people, including myself, couldn't resist the urge to yell "polo" at the screen. This is one of those movies that's so unbelieveably bad that it borders on being art (if you consider taking a dump on a puppy artistic expression that is). It amazes me that there are people out there that may actually like this movie, I can't think of a single use for it, though I can honestly say that if a copy of this film were found in Sadam Huisein's palace during operation Iraqi freedom, then it certainly justifies going to war and is proof that Saddam had at least one weapon of mass distruction 
 The front cover has been cut and demaged. However, as Amazon asserted that this was not their fault and asked me to pay the expensive international shipping fee if I really want to exchange for a new one. Absolutely nonsense 
 Almost nothing in this book is current enough to be helpful.  You are much better off using the online sites of the food manufacturers and restaurants and, if necessary, doing the math to figure out how the carbs, proteins, and fats translate into food exchanges.  Don't waste your money 
 After witnessing a sweet performance and sweeter song on television's Ally McBeal, I had such high hopes for this CD.  But a testosterone clone of the robot Charlotte Church was not on my agenda.  Turgid ballads, irritating arias, a monotone baritone, and a misguided remake of "Vincent [Starry Starry Night]"; you have to wonder just who is responsible for all this.  Then you notice roll call - David Foster, Walter Afanasieff, Richard Marx...then it all makes sense.  My grade:   
 This does not have the range that it states it does.  I even called their customer service person and asked about this and agreed with me.  Maybe useful for people in the city near a tower, other wise it is pretty useless 
 This movie was loaned to Me, (Thank God I did'nt rent it) and is the biggest waste of a few hours of My life ever! The acting is so horrible it made Me cringe,and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv.This is supposed to be a black comedy? It's NOT funny, and the so called violence in it made Me yawn, seriously, I've seen more gore on the Simpsons. There are so many things in the movie that are AMAZINGLY unbelievable, K. Sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through His neck, head,and two in the back.R. Witherspoon overpowers Sutherland (For the second time) and strangles Him, pretty good for a 90 pound teenage girl huh?  But, I do think Everybody should watch this movie once so You can see what a movie should NOT be.(Besides, misery loves company 
 This book is really disappointing. When the it was delivered at home, I thought the box was empty: the book is as thin as a magazine! The content is very theorical, completely useless for executives.  Maybe OK for students who have no clue at all about what strategy is, but definitely useless for executives.  
 I think those readers who are interested in erotic stories may find the selections in this audio tape a bit "technical" sounding.  The terminology used fell short of my definition of eroticism.  I would pass on  this selection 
 Presentation poor, band looked rough, playing sloppy apart from occasional solos by horn section, weak grooves. PAST SELL BY DATE I'm afraid. Expected full on funk... NOT.  I bought Chic Live at Montreaux along with this DVD, 5 STAR FUNK! how it should be!   Sold this turkey on Ebay the next day. P Funk? POOR FUN 
 I received my bowls today and was very disappointed.  How bowls this size can be referred to as "mixing" bowls I cannot fathom.  Neither do I know what could be mixed in bowls so small.  The second from the largest bowl is about the size of a normal cereal bowl. The bowls nest so the largest bowl holds the "cereal" bowl and the next to the smallest bowl nests in the cereal bowl.  The smallest bowl is a joke.  I doubt it would hold an extra large egg without running over.  The material is nice...melamine... and colorful but those are the only positive statements I can make 
 I am sorry, as much as I love historical fiction, and as much as I LOVED Shadowbrook, I could not get into this book.  While I appreciate the amount of research the author did into medical history of this time and treatment of slaves, the gore factor is WAY OVER THE TOP. Page after page after page, compounded with unappealing characters who even if one started to care, disappeared into another generation.    I gave up after 200 pages.  I give the author kudos for the well done research and keeping with known facts, but as stated before, the gore factor is way over what I can stomach for 600 pages.  If you are not sure if this is for you, I suggest you check it our from your local libary.  Then, if you absolutely love it, buy it.  JMHO 
      Ya, sure Mandela is a great person, a personification of a accumulation of moral and ethical supremeness, but lets face it, this book sucks.  I had to read this for a high school english class, and it bored me to death.  So many facts, so many potentially useless information, its as if Mandela intentionally tried to put emphasis on the less entertaining portions in his life.  Personally, I dont see how all the other commentors could stand finishing this book.  Good story...badly written 
 ...essentially you get what you pay for. This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.   I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.  At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price 
 I haven't recieved a single copy so I can't really review it. All I can say is the amazom service is terrible 
 After nearly two weeks, I'm still waiting for Kingston to ship out replacement ram. The ram was installed and after just one day, the ram caused several of the programs on my system to quit functioning.  After calling Kingston several times, they still have not shipped the replacement modules yet. It's been two weeks.  I would strongly consider a different brand next time. This company is not responsive. 
 I love the SANGO NOVA BROWN dishware and rate it 5 stars. This boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight. The slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer's comments. Mine too arrived broken. Sure seems like Sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box. Amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping. I sure hope Amazon gets credit from Sango for all these broken pieces. Combined score +2 
 It's a classic I know, but I just couldn't follow the country dialouge. Seeing the movie, the story itself is good. But in the book it is soo hard to understand and doesn't.....flow. Maybe it is just me? It's a classic, but I didn't like it. I recomend the book 
 As an experienced cook, I looked forward to the recipes in this book.  The recipes were verbose and vague.  She lists the ingredients in one column, but proceeds to write a book to explain the steps.  In the middle of cooking, you are lost trying to find the instructions because the author is writing a paragraph for "sautee in oil".  Just awful.  Hard to follow and impossible to stick to.  Avoid at all costs.  Better off trying the books put out by Cooks Ilustrated 
 Wow was that ever awful! I'd write more but Im busy cleansing my DVD player after loading that steaming pile!! 
 I am an avid reader, and I will finish a book no matter how difficult it is, or how boring it is, and I couldn't finish this one. It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I was really disappointed 
 I can't count how many glowing reviews I've read for this book.  I've come to the conclusion that those reviewers never actually read through the book.  Let me continue by saying that I got this book for a gift and, while I appreciate the thought, I feel awful about accepting it because it is hands-down, the worst book published since the dawn of Anglo-Western democratic civilization.   My first beef involves his name.  Susur.  Buddy, no one knows who you are so quit signing with only your first name.  Madonna is the only one that can get away with that, and even she is a washed-up hag.  The first "book" is just some pretentious blather about his life.  It's not even interesting.  No one had heard of this guy before he wrote the book, and that's because he hasn't done anything worth noting.  The actual recipe book is an abortion.  The recipes are all so incredibly complex, and require so much money that the only way someone is going to complete one is if they have: 1) too much time 2) too much money (you might actually have to sell your children to afford a recipe; I hear slave-trade brings in the most cash); and 3) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  Now I consider myself a pretty able chef (The French Laundry is one of my favorites), but I'm pretty sure that even Iron Chef Morimoto would get acid reflux reading this book.  "Complex" doesn't even begin to describe the recipes.  Actually, I'm pretty sure that there isn't a word in any of the European languages that illustrate the preposterous amounts of effort required to complete a dish.  If I went to a restaurant that offered a menu such as the one in Susur, I would get up and leave, and return fifteen minutes later with a jerrycan of gasoline, and a tub of motor oil and I would burn it to the ground.   Cocoa Squab Liver Pate with Taro Fritters Egg and Caviar Creme Fraiche and Honey Mustard Sauce?  Puh-lease, if that doesn't sound like latent homosexuality, I don't know what does.  If you're too lazy to read the stuff I wrote above let me SUMMARIZE:  - I would pay more money to contract Hepatis C than I would for this book.  I hope this review was helpful 
 Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, "aren't I hilarious?" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book.  Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book.  The story of the two families competing with each other - to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar, and donating various organs - was the train wreck of the Holiday tales.  (Although it may have been the story about the preacher, I can't say for sure because I gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely.  So, in fact, perhaps the story is not about a preacher.  I'll never know.  Neither should you.)   I think it's fair to say that the self-satisfied, condescending narrator of these tales simply couldn't bring himself to care about his characters.  They're simply dimensionless, cliched props - the self-centered suburban woman, the socially competitive neighbors - that should immediately journey to Oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which Sedaris has seen fit to deprive them.    Speaking of hearts and brains, this book could use a hefty dose of those, too.  
 Ever other knitting book/magazine/pattern etc. has stressed the importance of knitting gauge. Unfortunately, the patterns in this book don't even offer a gauge! I knit the baby booties...they came out absolutely adorable but were better suited for a Barbie than a baby...they were sooo tiny! I changed to needles two sizes larger and still ended up with bitty baby booties.  Without a knitting gauge, it is really hard to tell if you should change yarn, needles, or if you are knitting too tight or loose.   I also agree with the other readers who commented on the lack of photos. Why would I spend hours and hours on a project with no idea of what it should even look like (imagine spending two months on a sweater that you absolutely hate!).   There are sooo many other knitting books out there for beginners...skip this one and get Stitch n Bitch or Debbie Bliss "How to Knit" 
 Kidz Bop is really crap, the kids can't sing. Need I say more 
 Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.    Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.  Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results.  And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.  Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound.  It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system.   * Recently reprinted and highly recommended!  
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 Twenty years ago, Michael Jackson was recognizably human, and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric, he was the most beloved pop star on the planet.  And this album, even though it seemed harmless enough at the time, marks the point where things started to fall apart for him.  The infamous Pepsi Lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album's release.    It was the last album made by the Jacksons/ Jackson 5, and the only one (so far) with all six brothers on it.  The album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation.  Michael contributes a couple of songs: the truly horrifying ballad "Be Not Always" and the danceable "State of Shock."    "State of Shock" was a collaboration with Mick Jagger, and it is now best remembered as the finale of the Live Aid concerts in the summer of 1985.  Mick did it as a duet with Tina Turner (and their wardrobe reveals went much better than Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's did at the 2004 Super Bowl.)  And I think I have digressed, but that's OK because the other songs on the album are all done by the (then) less famous and (now) less notorious Jackson brothers.  These are assorted mid-1980s R&B pop numbers, nothing memorably good, nothing memorably bad.  The most enjoyable song, "Body" features the most obscure Jackson brother, Marlon, and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes, "Girl I love your body, so won't you come home with me!" or words to that effect.   
 I would not reccomend this book for learning about data structures. With incomplete code and scampy sections on core area material, it seems to serve more as a workbook than anything else. In addition to this I find it to be poorly worded which has often caused me to overlook important details or have to read a sentence multiple times to understand what the author is saying. What saves this from being a one star product is the fact that if you do know the material, it can help you review structures but even then, the ackward wording still can slow down a quick read 
 I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best. 
 This shall be the worst book you'll ever read, if you plan on reading it. This is a poorly developed story, written very poorly, about incredibly dumb, underdeveloped and uninteresting characters. This book isn't worth the curiosity you have for it. It even manages to have numerous syntax errors, as if the author didn't even bother to proofread it, it's as if it was written by a person who've never finished high school, or passed an English class, (and if that was the kind of works the author submitted for her English class, I'm not surprised she failed and dropped out, as the biography of the author states).  Very poor work, don't waste the 10$  and the time it would take you to read 400 pages.  Read The Catcher In The Rye, it's in the same genre but leagues ahead this one, in detail, writing style, and character development.   -I know that this review might read a bit cruel, it was simply meant to be honest 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 I liked this heating pad so much when I first used it that I immediately ordered a second one (for what I expected would be a year or two in the future). What I liked was that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads, allowing it to conform to the shape of my body. However, the first pad lasted only two weeks before failing to heat. I returned it to HomeMedics and they ignored me. The second one lasted nearly a month before it to failed to heat. I will not bother wasting the postage to return this one, as obviously HomeMedics does not care about quality nor customer satisfaction. I recommend that you not waste your money on this defective product 
 I did not receive the book I ordered.  The tracking process indicated that it had been sent to Atlanta to the Lost package dept.  There was no name to deliver to and no place to return.  I was disappointed not to receive a book I paid for 
 I waited until now to purchase 'Team America' the unrated version just when it was the right price. I got for $4.99. I have read the reviews and spoke to friends who had seen it and thought it might be worth owning it. I was wrong....upon watching it I realized it just wasn't that funny. Sure an occasional laugh here and there and ofcourse the sex scene was out of this world but that was it. I must admit the puppet masters did a great job but is this film worth watching more than once....I don't think so 
 I sadly wasted approximately 2 hours of my life listening to this sorely lacking "opera".  I was not at all surprised to read in the notes that the score had never actually been written to the piece, but rather, Monk came to the studio with a few ideas and improvised much of the work.  The tracks repeat endlessly without any meaningful development.  Some of them contain nonsensical dialogue as well, which adds little to the opera's overall effect.  Listen to the sample track "Ice Demons" for a good demonstration of ludicrous and pretentious composition.  While I'm not a devoted fan of minimalism in general, I can at least enjoy it on occassion.  In my opinion, some minimalist works like "Einstein on the Beach" by Philip Glass are far more sophisticated than Monk's opera and don't have the aggravating tendency to take themselves too seriously.  Monk's overdramatic spiritual nonsense really gets on the nerves 
 I have on word for this no-excuse-for-a-movie: Yecch 
 Taut with international intrigue and frenetic action, Robert Ludlum's novels are generally highly entertaining and rich with suspense. The standard of The Cry of the Halidon, however, is well below his usual.   Unlike most of his other books, The Cry of the Halidon is rarely suspenseful and does not build to a recognizable climax. The plot is typical Ludlum fare, with Alexander Tarquin Mcauliff selected by a company, -Dunstone Limited- to head a survey team deep into the Jamaican forests. Minutes after successfully attaining the survey assignment, he is approached by British Intelligence and informed that the motives of Dunstone are far from honest.  Naturally, he finds himself involved not only with British Intelligence, Dunstone and the rebel factions of Jamaica but also with a third faction, an organization known only as the "Halidon." While initially this may seem gripping and interesting, the text quickly becomes confused and rambling. With so many hostile organizations and no primary antagonist, it is frequently difficult to comprehend the plot, let alone the actions of the main character.  Although the novel does become more interesting at its conclusion, I found The Cry of the Halidon to be ultimately unsatisfying, with its more suspenseful elements overwhelmed by a confusing plot, a sprawling diction and a lackluster climax. 
 This film is basically about drugs and killing. I did not really find a plot behind it. I did have a story but it was not a very strong one. I kind of like 50 Cent so I thought that it was going to be an ok movie. I was wrong. I do not hold the same respect for 50 cent that I have because I cannot beleive that he starred in such a meaningless film.  The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I did want to see what happened in the end, so I watched it and payed attention. Other than that, I hopefully will never see this film again. 
 Sara Tate, an assistant district attorney, has gotten an ordinary buglary case on her first day on the job. The case changes to murder and she realizes it is anything but ordinary. Jared, her busband, gets a client who will bolster his chances of becoming a partner in a law firm. The catch: he will square off against his wife, and anything less than acquittal results in death for the one he loves. Will they be able to surmount the difficulties at home? And what will be the price of their rivalry, because no matter who wins he loses. Brad Meltzer gets high marks for content; a couple slugging out it out in the courtroom is indeed fertile land in the malnourished plains of legal fiction. Still Dead Even is no immacaulate conception. The dialogue is puerile, the plot asinine, the ending insignificant. No one stands up to the thugs as they go around harassing Jared and Sara. The novel resembles a house painter's effort on canvas. 
 I don't know what type of Italian/American family other people grew up in, but I grew up in a loving family with wonderful warm traditions, holidays filled with love, humor and great food, songs sung in Italian, stories of the old country and a door that was always open with the coffee on the stove...I found none of that nostalgia here.  What I did find was the stereotypical pictures, sayings and gestures that unfortunately television portrays Italian/Americans to be.  If you are looking for a book that not only will translate swears from Italian, but will show you pictures of the gestures as well, or teaches you the correct Italian response to someone farting, this one is for you 
 It is odd that my taste buds reported to me the opposite of the reviews here.  I'm disappointed by that, as I paid this premium price based on the 5 star reviews.  I'm old enough to remember "old time" licorice that was sold for 1 cent (even 5 for a penny) and that is the flavor and consistancy that I was looking forward to when I purchased this licorice.  I have some anise spice in my cupboard for baking, and I just tasted it to make sure that I didn't have my spices mixed up.  Based on that comparison; My verdict is that this licorice tastes strongly of anise (NOT licorice).  I thought it was much too soft.  There was no "chew" to it.  It was mushy.  The only thing I can think to compare it with is a soft cheese, such as Havarti.  It is even softer than a mild chedder.   Sorry... only 2 stars from me 
 I have to admit, that I was suprised to see that this book got such a high rating, as it was the one in the series that pushed me away from Xanth.  I finished it and was overcome by a sense of pointlessness in reading these books that must have begun with "Demons Don't Dream."  The older books are much better, when the author actually had a story to tell, it seems unfortunate that now Anthony spends his time with Xanth in attempts to fill it with what he thinks are clever puns to appease the fans who send in their ideas, when really in my opinion, the puns are just plain annoying.  I suggest Anthony stops cranking out Xanth books so quickly, and instead tries to think of some interesting stories to tell, although I have to say, there are signs of improvment with the most recent books, "Faun and Games," for example 
 Horror movies are a dime a dozen now, and nothing really speical about them anymore. Sad to say, considering its probably my faviorte genere. This movie was a disappointment from the start. Whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired. I mean they are standing there talking, and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen. I didnt watch the whole movie, it sucked that bad. I bought this movie used, and I'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge. 
 I love Gwen Stefani and No Doubt, adn I figured, to tide me over until the Sweet Escape, I'd get one of ND's older CDs since I have all of them Tragic Kingdom and on. It was between their debut and this. since Beacon Street got rave reviews, i bought it over the self-titled one.. When i popped it into my stereo, it was only alright. Some tracks were ok, but some made me feel nauseated and I could only listen to it for the first 5 seconds. *cough* blue in the face *cough* The only songs that I liked were By The Way and Doghouse was ok. I lovvveee by the way though. Overall its worth two stars for me. [I love the inside of the disc all the pics are so cool. I also like the disc with all the little band members!]  A 
 When I picked this book up, I expected it to be interesting.  As a fat kid, I thought I would enjoy the story, thinking that I would feel connected to the main character.  Boy, was I wrong.  In the beginning of the book, Troy, feeling suicidal, wants to throw himself on the tracks, but Curt, a skinny druggie, stops him.  By the middle of the book, I wish Curt had just held back and let Troy jump.  The book was very slow for me; each new chapter sounded like the last.  I read this short book over two weeks because I just couldn't take it.  The end was unsurprisingly predictable.  I mean, I could've told you what was going to happen by the fifth chapter.  Usually, when I read a book, I take something from it, maybe a lesson or a moral.  In this book, I just felt a sense of nonclosure... the ending didn't really do it for me.  Based on the other reviews on this page, you probably think that I'm just a mean person who writes scathing reviews on great books.  The first part may be true, but I only write scathing reviews on things I did not particularly like.  You may not have liked Macbeth, but I sure did.  Whether it's a good book or not is all a matter of opinion 
  We are getting ready to open the tea room in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and I assumed this book would be helpfull but its was not. Lots of recipes were not accurate, missing steps and ingridients, the photos are nice, but they do not match the recipes. Very disappointing!     Olga Cannon 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 It's possible to write an outstanding book about a board game.  It's called "Word Freak," by Stephan Fatsis, and it's a bizarre and engaging look into the world of competitive Scrabble.  "Monopoly: The Story Behind the World's Best-Selling Game" is not even in the same league as "Word Freak."  Most of the book actually is about Atlantic City, not Monopoly.  There are a couple of pages of the history of the game, along with some neat photos of original versions (a round board!), but after that, the book goes downhill.  The rest of the book is basically a discussion of the namesakes of the properties on the Monopoly board (which are all named after streets in Atlantic City).  There's plenty of historical photos of the city, but not much else in the way of Monopoly.  What I wanted to read about was the game.  The book briefly mentioned house rules, but I wanted much more on that.  How were the tokens decided on?  Why do the games no longer include the cannon and battleship tokens?  What about Monopoly tournaments?  I've even heard about *underwater* Monopoly tournaments, but there's no mention of them here.  How about strategies to win?  How about a listing of all the many, many variations of the game?    There's so much you could do with this book, but the author chose to take a different route.  He should have used a different title, too, because this book doesn't live up to the one he chose 
 While this story is truly an essential writing of Dostoevsky, it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy.  If you are interested in reading "The Grand Inquisitor" without reading the rest of The Brothers Karamazov, I would recommend the Guignon edition, sold for only a little more.  This work includes the two chapters preceeding "The Grand Inquisitor" as well as what Dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale, "The Russian Monk," which follows this legend.  Dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole, but I think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy.  Additionally, this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by Charles Guignon, which is much more informative than the brief one by Anne Fremantle provided in this copy.  It is important to remember that "The Grand Inquistor" was not Dostoevsky's final answer in The Brothers Karamazov.  Reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both Dostoevsky's writing and philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov.  I would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [and I particularly recommend the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation for that: it is much more accurate to the original Russian].  Or at a minimum, reading the other edition of this book.  Either way, you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of Dostoevsky, which this fails to provide.  The Grand Inquisitor is truly an essential read, but not in this presentation of it 
 It's a long, boring book about some old dirt farmer out in bumf&*k, Nebraska beating his wife and having kids he doesn't love.  The end 
 This will only please the most ardent vampire fans.  Why?  It's exceedinly poorly written.  I figured when I watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn't matter.  Sadly it was neither.  Don't get me wrong, it was bad, but in all of the wrong ways.  For example the writing, plot dialog, character development is basically not there...well they are they're just about as interesting as chalk.  Unfortunately the acting's not bad.  This results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie.  You can't laugh at the bad dialog because it isn't bad enough, it's just flat.  And you can't laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it's acceptable.  It's got gore and blood, but it isn't the least bit scary.  In general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way.  if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of Amityville Horror to be released.  Ryan Reynolds may not play a vampire, but that movie had more development in it's credits than this had in it's entirety 
 These glasses are VERY cheap. I sent everyone of them back. When i recived them 2 were broken. They are very thin 
 Be warned. The Office Project program advertised as included is a trial version. The ad does not say this. Now I have to turn around a buy a new program- Amazon customer service says it isn't their fault. I really needed the book and the program for a class due to start in four days. Now I'm really stuck. Amazon is even trying to get me to pay for the return shipping 
 I no longer have this book, so I can't comment on the details, but it was the main text of a class that I took at UC Santa Barbara.  I was very excited about the class, which was an amalgamation of two of my favorite disciplines: music and physics.  Well, the class and the text were both disappointing, and I dropped the class.  What I remember of the book is that it seemed rather dull, and it tended towards older ways of thinking about music, particularly in regards to the psychology of pitch (consonance = happy! dissonance = disturbed!).   It did not seem like a real scholarly work to me.  And I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the computer music section was totally out-of-date 
 This watch stinks.  Crappy manual, the band is so big it could fit around my leg, and when I received it, IT DIDN'T WORK.  Now I have to pay extra to fix the band AND to get it working.  So much for what I thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch. I would've given it no stars if I could. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID - AVOID THIS WATCH 
 A French saying goes: "The more things change, the more they stay the same."  It appears that the "historical" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that "poetic" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth.  One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.    Firstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina.  Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to "purify" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is "preserve the Aryan race."  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.  Yes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single "good" thing about this movie would have been "discovered/invented" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.    They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a "hero" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.    In conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the "techniques" that this film claims to have "discovered" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.  So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess 
 I had heard a lot of great things about Skyzoo's debut "Cloud 9: The 3 Day High," and decided to finally check i tout recently. I was very disappointed by the whole album. Multiple people have told me that this was one of 2006's best albums, and I wonder if I am listening to the same album. This album did not really appeal to me at all. Skyzoo, a Brooklyn native, is a decent but not outstanding MC. Skyzoo sounds like Jay-Z on a bad day. His flow and voice are almost identical to Jigga's, and much of the time his subject matter is similar. The majority of the time, Skyzoo is talking about hustling to make money, clothes, cars, and women, which I expected better than. There are a few tracks where Skyzoo tells stories and philosophizes a little, which I liked much more, and I wish he would do more often. Even though his vocabulary is pretty street, he is fairly clever and has the ability to keep your attention, which is why I wish he would vary his subject matter a little more. He is obviously very passionate about rapping, but I can't see him going mainstream, which is what he wishes for by the sound of it. Adding to this disappointment is 9th Wonder's performance on this album. I think 9th is a good producer, and I have liked some of his work with Little Brother, Jay-Z, and Kaze. But "Cloud 9" brings all of his weaknesses to the forefront. More so than usual, these beats have a very computerized feel, and you can really tell they were made on his Fruity Loops program. These beats are incredibly repetitive and often quite boring. A few tracks saved this album in my mind, but "Cloud 9: The 3 Day High" isn't an album that has me coming back for more.  "Bare Witness," an intro, starts the album with a typically boring beat and some of Skyzoo's better rhymes, inviting the listener to prepare for a game-changing performance. On "Way to Go," a weak sample anchors an average beat that is the backdrop for some tired bragadagio and boasting. "A Day in the Life" has probably the best beat on the album, a nice bass line covered with strings, but Skyzoo only raps about his proficience with the women, not doing it justice. I hated the beat on "Stop Fooling Yourself," and in this case the lyrics were much better, about a conversation with God. "Comeback" has weak production and the lyrics are bad too, all about women. "I'm on It" is incredibly repetitive musically and the lyrics don't really go anywhere. "The Bodega" is kind of cool, a profile of the city life, but not too memorable. "You & Me," another song about a woman, was more skip material to me. "Live and Direct" has a nice beat with a winding jazzy horn line, but Skyzoo's performance could put you to sleep. "The Spirit" is totally forgettable. Lyrically "Extreme Measures" is by far the best song. Skyzoo tells the tale of a man's life, making a journey hoping to help his young son and get away from his wife. "Mirror Mirror" ends the album fittingly, a bad song with a terrible chorus.  I think that some more varied subject matter and a different musical support would definitely benefit Skyzoo. Fans of 9th Wonder should know that this is probably the most musically uninteresting piece I have heard from him, and Skyzoo doesn't help it much. This album has a lot of skip material and overall is very forgettable. I don't recommend this album to anyone except 9th Wonder diehards, but even to those I don't recommend it very highly.  Please note that Amazon's tracklist is incorrect. There are actually twelve songs, appearing in this order:  1. Bare Witness 2. Way to Go 3. A Day in the Life 4. Stop Fooling Yourself 5. Come Back 6. I'm on It 7. Bodega 8. You & Me 9. Live & Direct 10. The Spirit 11. Extreme Measures 12. Mirror Mirror 
 Strange to say, I did not like this novel nearly as much as her earlier work.  I usually find her narrative voice and her attention to detail charming and engaging, but here it bogged down and just became tedious.  There are no fully-drawn characters, only types, including the heroine (or should I say "hairoyne" -- from a motif in the novel) herself.  And, while I found the dilemmas of her earlier characters regarding marriage and identity quite moving, especially in "Another Marvelous Thing" and "Family Happiness," I found Geraldine's crises to border on the selfish and self-absorbed.  Who knows what might have followed this swan song?  For all of that, I do love Colwin, and I still cook from her cookbooks 
 Amery did not only pick up a new French-sounding name, but (although this book was originally written in German) apparently also the circumlocutionary style of the French. If you like a book full of idle verbiage, with arguments beginning nowhere and leading nowhere, and references to passé writers such as Sartre, then this book is for you.   But it's not merely the style that I disliked. All essays (rants, more like) gravitate around Amery's pathological hate for all Germans, past and present. All Germans, except for some four individuals he mentions by name, are inherently bad. Nazis all of them, and torture is the essence of their being. Amery is dissatisfied with the world, because after the war, Germany was not permanently turned into a potato patch as the Morgenthau plan had envisaged it. A typical only child, Amery seems to think that the world should turn around his personal sufferings and frustrations. He hardly ever speaks of his fellow prisoners, and if he does, he belittles them because they are not interested in, let alone able to quote Liliencron or other poets Any Intellectual Should Know. Finally, as could be expected, the post-war generation of Germans is bad, because they do not want to permanently crawl in the dust before Amery.   I regret having spent money on this book. 
 Literary critic should have titled this little guide `What to Read and Why,' seeing as he devotes only a few paragraphs to why reading might be valuable. That said, Bloom is a terrifyingly accomplished reader, but he isn't much of a thinker or a critic in the way Benjamin or Derrida were. Bloom's incessant propensity to judge all literature from the `how is this compared to Shakespeare' lens is foolish and lacking in any insight. At times his criticism seems almost amateurish and rushed. He doesn't seem to be a very good reader of Hemingway, for instance. At the outset of a review of `Hills Like White Elephants,' Bloom writes that "Hemingway's personal mystique-his bravura poses as warrior, big-game hunter, bullfighter, and boxer-is irrelevant to `Hills Like White Elephants' as its male protagonist's insistence that `You know that I love you'" (47). Yet later in Bloom's review, he writes [on `The Snows of Kilimanjaro']: The irony is at Hemingway's expense, insofar as Harry prophesies the Hemingway who, nineteen days shor of his sixty-second birthday, turned a double-barreled shotgun on himself" (49). Bloom seems to have reversed tactics here. Never the less, Bloom is an undeniably great reader of poetry; in this volume he tells you all about his personal favorites: Stevens, Whitman, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, etc. Kind of fun, but far from great criticism.  
 This movie is dumb. It would be alright if yo u got to know all the other characters. And I think I saw this movie before, it was called madagascar! Don't get this movie! It short and pointless. If you want to watch something with your kids, don't pick this up. I recomend Chiken Little or the incredibles! sure chiken little might be short, but atleast it tells about its characters! I really don't recomend this one...at all!    P.S. Don't buy it, watch it or... anything else that is similer. What a snoozer, twenty bucks is such a loss 
 This item will not work if you have a Yamaha keyboard. The people at the company were very nice to deal with but their product just won't work with a Yamaha keyboard. There was a constant low humming noise that showed up at a low note on the music notation software I us 
 This book is vey difficult to understand and learn from.  It's explanations are too abbreviated with not enough information on each code.  Also, not all codes and conventions are included, and it reads like a novel, meaning not very descriptive or illustrative.  Too many paragraphs and sentences 
 I can't believe folks would buy this garbage. The title of this book and much of its content were ripped off (yes, plagarized) from George Carlin's bit "Religion is a Mental Illness". But that is not unusal as Mr. Weiner has ripped off other people's work throughout his career. I hope see this guy for the fraud he is 
 I was disappointed with the movie. I foremost ordered it because I wanted a movie in German, not because of the actors in it. It was German alright, but that was about all I liked. So this schoolteacher goes to Turkey to follow the girl of his dreams and all sorts of bizare things happen to him on the way. This spontaneous girl Juli accompanies him on the way and wants him to fall in love with her instead, which of course, he eventually does. Storyline is okay, but the whole movie is just a mess. The director tried too hard to make it hip, modern and fun, that somehow it simply is not. Christine Paul just doesn't fit the part she's playing, maybe it's her age, maybe because she never seems to get comfortable with her part, and Moritz Bleibtreu really isn't that cute and one never gets the chance to really like any of the characters. It ends up being a mess one watches from the distance. I was glad when the movie was over an I am not planning on watching it again, so if anyone wants my copy, let me know.  
 This gun broke in the first few used.   When I called for service, they inisted on waiting for the tech, and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun  cost.  Overall...  this was a writeoff 
 This Detox program would be difficult to follow for someone with a job and demands on their time. It is not a simple plan 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 Kimmel and Messner are acomplished researchers, yet I find no reason for the "cute" little additions such as average male size charts and sarcastic quizes revolving around the "gay or straight" issues.  We are saturated with sexuality in our day and age, we don't need it from our scholars as well 
 Mr. Douglas purports to be in possession of "secret files" furnished to him by Robert Crowley.  In fact Gregory Douglas never met Robert Crowley.  Robert Crowley regarded Douglas as a harmless eccentric.  I know this to be a fact because I am Robert Crowley's son.  Legal action was considered pointless since Douglas has no assets and a trial would only produce publicity for Douglas's book 
 This is the first and only book I've bought concerning social phobia. Perhaps because I had already researched this subject on the web, a lot of the suggestions in this book were common sense and obvious. Too much was devoted to explication (e.g., what causes anxiety, nature vs. nature, what are SSRIs, etc.) vs. providing actual suggestions which I thought was a waste.  Was I expecting too much? I don't know. There weren't any revelations in this book. Even the anecdotes were a disappointment, I wished the author fleshed them out more. This book may be useful for those comletely NEW to this topic, but I suggest you look elsewhere if you want to delve deeper. 
 Please check the price as the book in Hong Kong is about $25 US doll 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 The only way that this book could be entertaining at all is if you go into it expecting nothing.  I was very disappointed in the writing.  The style is cheesy and the storyline is shallow and lame.  I had thought that this book was going to be a fun 'chick' book but the only 'chick' that would enjoy it lives in a barn 
 It is time for the transgendered to stop being so in denial about autogynephilia. This is sexual desire for the idea of oneself as a woman. For males who become females, but who are not exclusively attracted to men, that is what motivates us. A very vocal group of closet cases has tried to make discussion of this concept off limits. But do we have to cooperate in that?   This book mostly takes the standard line stressing gender identity, where anyone who wants to be the other sex has that desire because the are similar to the other sex, at least in their gender identity. But that's not what motivated me. I had sexual desire for myself as a sexy woman. That Mildred Brown works with transsexual patients but cannot (or will not) discuss autogynephilia does not attest to her clinical insight.  I know this is hard to understand for the uninitiated (although if you are reading these reviews, are you really uninitiated?). If you don't get it, read Bailey's "The Man Who Would Be Queen." 
 Mexican food is absolutely sacred to me, and this book is a profanation.  I bought it after spending a year in mexico and wanting to recapture some of the tastes i came to love so much.  it was a big dissapointment.  I can understand how it might be a neat story that she went there not knowing spanish but that she still learned how to cook some things... however, her "outsiders perspective" comes across as irritating ignorance.  her methods are anecdotal (as oppossed to researched) and in her recipes and stories she manages to miss both the grace of high class mexican cuisine and the flair of mexicos bountiful street food culture.  diana kennedy and rick bayless (to name the two most famous) both have books in english that are more thoughtful and authoritative.  even a quick glance at one of these far superior books will expose ortiz's attempt as the exercise in vain superfulousness that it is 
 I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility.  Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow.  Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case.   The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development.   The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks.  The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs.  At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as,        "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way.   This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries.  
 There is nothing I can add here that most of the other reviewers have not already stated.  I bought this book off the discount shelf, on a whim for the title and description - ironically, for Tosches explains exactly such buyer whims in the letter he wrote to his publisher in the long middle chapter of the book.  If not for the huge sign proclaiming "Hardcover Bestsellers for $7.99" (who can resist browsing for a hardcover at that price?), I might have continued a blissful ignorance of Nick Tosches altogether.  I learned long ago, however, that serious readers are often explorers in the spirit of Columbus, always searching for new horizons and occasionally colliding with the unknown.  As unintentionally or unthinkingly as the collisions occur, they nonetheless influence the paths of our lives.  So it is with my first encounter with Nick Tosches and "In the Hand of Dante."  Though engaged variously by some of the characters; the intellectual discourse on Catholicism and papacy; and an honest baring of the soul that reveals how difficult it is indeed to create - this book was a maddening reading experience.  An original idea that could have been crafted into a satisfying story, Tosches instead vomits a gush of chapters that present a barely cohesive narrative.  Yeah, Nick is a smart guy.  Yet for all the cleverness and complexity he tries to weave into this story, pedantic prose and self-indulgence seem more the work of an average college freshman writing a theme paper than that of an acclaimed author.  I give it two stars because I liked Lou, the hitman, and for the fact that it wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it.  Still, Tosches intrigues me enough that I'd like to read another of his books.  Don't let me down, Nick 
 The year: 1965. The cast: Peter Sellers. Peter O'Toole. Woody Allen. Ursula Andress. The soundtrack: Burt Bacharach. Tom Jones. Dionne Warwick. Manfred Mann. The movie: Believe it or not -- terrible. Really... as in unwatchable (other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits.) Painfully unfunny slapstick routines, actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards, and no plot to speak of. Not even fun to watch for 60's camp value like The Party or Casino Royale... I had to turn it off at about the halfway mark. Grade: Incomplete  Safest bet: Get the soundtrack, skip the movie... 
 The power of marketing behind Mrs. Souza is incredible! Her previous album, Brazilian Duos, was listed among the Best Jazz Albums of 2001 by New York Times - a critic, Mr. Ben Ratliff, had received an advance CD copy and included the album on his list, although the album only would be officially released in April 2002...Strange? Well, the next year the same Mr. Ratliff, in the same NY Times, included the same CD in his Best Jazz Albums of 2002 list...Then, "Brazilian Duos" got a Grammy nomination in March 2003...And now, in a few days, this horrible "North and South" CD will receive a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album...No more comments 
 Four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction, loaded with drugs with Paul McCartney in charge -- what do you get?  Magical Mystery Tour.  With no plot, great music, this plays as a too-long music video without purpose. OK if you're a Beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967.  But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is no reason for this.  At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard Lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers - but this?  Too many drugs and too much ego and no direction.  That's all.  
 I bought this book because I thought that I would be able to see everything in the exhibition in detail, and more, as is usually the case with most catalogs from museum shows. Well, this was not the case at all! There was so little in this book, that I decided to return it because it was such a disappointment. The book shows three views of the same few dresses, one view per page, and a tiny bit of the jewelry, with many big blank pages spread out in between, as if they had to get this done in a hurry and had to fill up a certain amount of pages by press time, so it would look like it was "designed". It didn't show anywhere near the scope of what Chanel did, either a long time ago or the more recent things done by Lagerfeld 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
 Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the "desperate", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore. 
 John Harris is not shy about his feelings for DSotM.  The back cover of this book states "Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' (1973) is one of the most beloved albums of all time.  A sonically stunning exploration into dark themes...  Besides being perhaps the most fully realized and elegant concept album ever recorded, 'The Dark Side of the Moon' [sic] was also one of the most technologically advanced LPs of its day."    Yeah, right.  Questionable hyperbole aside, Harris starts the book with the by-now familiar story of The Pink Floyd Sound, Syd Barrett, early psychedelia, quick success, Syd's decline and the band's decision to carry on without him.  It's an interesting story, and many books and articles have mined it for dramatic appeal.  For me, what happened next is the most interesting part -- the band throws out the pop song format and begins turning music inside out, experimenting with long drones, alternate playing techniques, and new music structures never before seen on this planet.  Their incredible inventiveness creates a whole new style of music, with a ripple effect on everything that follows.  Unfortunately, Harris is less enamored of "Saucerful," "More," "Ummagumma," "Atom Heart," "Meddle" and "Obscured" than I am, dismissing them rather cavalierly as "poorly realized, loose-ended stuff" that "sought, in their own ill-advised way, to test both their audience's expectations and the limits of musical orthodoxy."  Apparently musical orthodoxy is very important to author Harris, because he gets all gushy when he gets to Chapter 3 and starts relating stories of the creation of DSotM.  For those of us who LOVED the unorthodoxy and limits-testing, DSotM was a huge disappointment from day one, the episode where Pink Floyd "jumped the shark" (to use a TV metaphor), sold out and started playing to the lowest common denominator.  It was also the undeniable beginning of the end, where PF got so famous that they became prisoners of their own success.  Instead of musicians, they became commodities.  They all went off and bought mansions and were miserable.  To Harris this is all fine.  DSotM is his favorite album in the whole world and he gathers all available material about the creation of this album.  It's a fine story as far as it goes; and Harris does a credible job of telling it; and Floyd fans will enjoy the retelling.  I just wish John Harris knew the Pink Floyd I knew and loved. 
 this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports. their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing, for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be #1 in ranking. often, the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that isn't relevant, or doesn't make sense, or the review isn't consistent with the posted viehicle stats. the magazine also seems to be biased. some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful. after further reading of many issues, you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers, for example, you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically "trash" and a japanese brand or a BMW is always the way to go, when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews. ultimately, its a bad guide towards getting any  information on automobiles period. its the pat robertson of auto magazines. if it were possible, i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star. 
  Hi kids!  I'm Methyl Mercaptan, the ingredient in flatulence that makes it smell.  I reside deep within Mike Savage's cranium, being created by anaerobic bacteria that's busy decomposing whatever remains within his brain cavity.  We call Mike's comfy cranium the turd world.  Whenever Mike opens his mouth a little bit of me escapes, but don't worry because Mike keeps making more.  Whenever he exhales near an open flame he inexplicably is wearing his double-wide pants on his head, and when they catch fire you can yell "Liar, liar, pants on fire".  As for his art, he doesn't do his shambolic girth justice:  There isn't a seismograph in the country that doesn't have a restraining order against a guy so fat that he displaces more water than a battleship.  Well, I have to go now.  Mike just found an image of the Virgin Mary in his freedom fries, and he's about to giggle with girlish glee.  See ya real soon 
 I really enjoyed this book. I am a Counsellor and a Coach and have already had several opportunities to relay some of the information in it to clients of mine who in turn have found it concrete and easy to understand. There is a very good section on children that all parents would do well to read 
 The most god awful CD I have ever listened to. I bought it randomly at a CD store, and it was a huge waste of money. I like some bands that are really messy (like Guitar Wolf), but this is just garbage. It isn't even understandable. It isn't music, it's noise. I can't believe these guys got a record deal. Don't believe anyone that says it is good. If you buy this album you will seriously regret it 
 This book is not for the modern mom:  the mom who plays with her children, looks for the best schools for them, tries to prevent them from injuring themselves, and actually takes photos of them.  Muffy proudly denounces all of these practices.    This book was annoying.  Her "slacker" approach to parenting amounts to nothing more than being emotionally and physically distant from her children.    She is not a huggy-snuggly-sentimental mommy.  Her rational is that her mother parented her with a hands-off appoach and she turned out fine.  However, the reason her parents were as such is because they worked on a cattle ranch 7 days a week!  Why do I get the feeling that Little-Girl-Muffy didn't especially appreciate her parents working every single day, leaving her to play in the dirt with cattle hands as a small child?  There are deeper wounds lying beneath the prose of this book.  However, she refuses to acknowledge them and comes across as condesending to any of us parent differently from her or her mother (which, thankfully, is most of us).  Her children are far to young, her parenting experience barely begun, for her to write a book as smug as this.    If you are sensitive to the use of the English language, the numerous incomplete sentences that pepper this book will bother you.       
 I have read several books in the Dummies series and found them all excellent, so when it was time to learn SQL for a programming project I got this one immediately.  Unfortunately, SQL for Dummies, turned out to be that absolute worst technical book I have ever laid eyes on.  It jumps from topic to topic without ever really explaining anything.  It uses examples that are unecessarily complex -- I get the feeling his examples just come from years of working with databases, rather than a desire to illustrate any particular thing -- and the examples are never explained.  Over and over, there will be a snippet of SQL code used as an example, and I will wonder, "what does this or that part of the statement do?"  But he never explains anything.  He just throws it out there and then moves on.  Dummies books always have a conversational tone, but the tone in this book is overly hokey and just reads like meaningless filler; all the more frustrating because there isn't really any content that it's filling in between.  All I wanted was the basics of database design and interaction, an enumeration of the commands used for creating and interacting with databases and why some actions are useful and for what, and examples throughout of how one would do typical things.  Instead I got an intolerable and incoherent ramble 
 I'll be the first to admit that the Carlyle Group seems to "work" the system...perhaps even abuse it to profit from their "connections" to goverment.  And yes, they've done a few thing most people would find to be inappropriate.  However the author's case would have been much more compelling had he simply stated the facts and not editorialized so much.  The result makes you feel like it's a crackpot conspiracy theory.  His liberal use of adjectives and obvious melodrama to make us think something horribly sinister is afoot made me bitter toward journalists, rather than his intended target, the Carlyle Group.   Typical of the news media today: he couldn't just report the facts...he had to color it with his political (or paranoid) biases 
 I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken. The "L" shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem. I will call it a receiver. It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break. Over time the receiver doesn't receive.  I would not recommend this product. It's better to have a straight receiver. 
 Like the HBO Show: Real Time with Bill Maher; this book too often cuts to the cheap joke. Maher, always a mediocre stand-up, can't resist an easy joke where a top comic would aim higher. Bill sets the bar comfortably low: keep the yucks coming, kiss the celebrity bum, but don't break a sweat or Heaven Forbid come up with something original.  
 okay before i dog this cd to hell and back i would like to point out a few things first eminem sounds like a little kid who got punched in the balls all tho i used to be fan untill i figured out that all his "songs" are just like the last. plus how can you call a song live if you dont have a live band. if you're gonna buy a cd buy one with class or at least a cd that doesnt suck like this on 
  This past November, I was in Reno, Nevada.  Mrs. Van Owen, the shuttle driver who picked me up at the airport (women are always picking me up) pointed out the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral as she was pulling into my hotel's parking lot, and she said, "That's the church they used in the movie SISTER ACT."  Had it been ANY other church, I would have thought, Great, now how much do the video poker machines pay out on four deuces here?  But it just so happens that when I was in Reno on August 12, 2001, Jesus sent me to the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral  (although I'm not Catholic) where I was the only White person to be found in the pews, and where I observed a Catholic mass delivered entirely in Spanish.  (The only Spanish I know is "Si", "No", and some words that Ricky Garcia called me in junior high school.)  I kept thinking, Nice music, Lord, but why did You send me here?  It wasn't until the mass ended and I exited the church, that He revealed His purpose:  On the steps of that very cathedral, Jesus, with a "miraclette", answered an important and troubling question that I'd been praying about for an entire month.  (That's a story for another review.)  So when my shuttle driver mentioned that particular church being used in the movie SISTER ACT, I determined to rent the 1992, WHOOPI GOLDBERG vehicle upon my return to Airheadzona.  I'm back and I did.  Now, I grew tired of Goldberg's sassy, mononote thing a long time ago ("You want me to do WHAT?!  Uh-uh.  You got the WRONG woman, fool!"), so I wasn't expecting much, and my expectations were met but not exceeded.  I knew this thing was going to be nun too good when I saw Harvey Keitel mentioned in the opening credits.  (I have a rule of thumb: "Avoid EVERYTHING with Harvey Keitel in it."  But since there's an exception to almost every rule, I'll add, "except maybe TAXI DRIVER.")  SISTER ACT's bad habits started immediately:  It opens with a scene at "Saint Anne's Academy in 1968" (with the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral playing the part of Saint Anne's Academy in one brief shot.  Boo! I rented THIS movie for THAT?)  Here we find Deloris Van Cartier (later played by Goldberg) as a youngster being asked by a nun to name the apostles.  She gives a "Fabulous" (but incorrect) answer.  Cut to Van Cartier many years later performing as the leader in a girl group retro act at a Reno lounge, and showing great unhappiness at being ignored by the nearby boozers and gamblers.  Is it really unusual for free entertainment on a casino floor to go scarcely noticed? Would this REALLY upset a longtime lounge singer?  Wouldn't she be used to the lack of attention while on stage by now?  It would be the norm; just another day, just another paycheck.  We've got nonsense right out of the chute, I thought.  The two-bit Reno nightclub singer, Van Cartier, accidentally witnesses her boyfriend, Vince LaRocca, orchestrate a young man's murder.  (HARVEY KEITEL plays the evidently sight-challenged mobster.  He couldn't find a more attractive two-bit nightclub singer in all of Reno?  Please!)  Now Van Cartier is (a soon-to-be nun) on the run.  Until LaRocca's murder charge comes up for trial, Lieutenant Eddie Souther (BILL NUNN, who must have gotten the part based only on his last name) places Van Cartier in a convent under the Witness Protection Program.  The hulking Nunn is horribly miscast and gives a downright embarrassing performance as a lawman.  Trying to pass this guy off as a street-hardened, high-ranking law enforcement officer is like trying to pass off Garfield the cat as a police dog!  Nunn plays most scenes with this goofy "oh-you-kid" grin.  (Sit down Lieutentant before you hurt yourself!)  Meanwhile, gangster LaRocca - awaiting his murder trial, yet incredibly free to roam the city (What? Did he have a "Get Out Of Jail" card tucked into his "violin case"?) - and his two unintimidating, geriatric hitmen, are trying to locate Van Cartier to enunciate with gunfire their displeasure at her willingness to testify.  In the convent, Van Cartier's life is adhering to the typical Hollywood formula - "the outcast finds her niche and makes good" paint-by-numbers kit.  You know the gig!  And we're treated to all the usual: Tough and/or cool street people in ridiculously exaggerated "tough and/or cool street people" costumes (how about just T-shirts and jeans, folks?  You know, like REAL people on the street wear?); the gag where three guys simultaneously rush through a small opening and momentarily get stuck a la The Three Stooges (Har!-Har!-Har!); and of course, the obligatory and ubiquitous bit where the guys take it in the "family jewels" while the heroine makes good her escape.  (The nutcracker shtick ceased to be fresh and funny about 1976, but they're still feeding it to us regularly because, you know, there's little genuine writing talent in Tinsel Town.  Or haven't you noticed?)  There are about 101 additional problems with this act, Sisters and Brothers, but there's no point in listing them all; it's not like you're going to pay attention to anything I say anyway.  (The nuns fly to Reno to rescue Van Cartier because... uhm... there was no way to telephone Reno Law Enforcement?  That's just a guess on my part.  "Ain't nun of ya in the habit of keeping any spare change around, pray tell?")  I did enjoy the clever musical arrangements, and Goldberg's prayer before supper at the convent was appropriately inappropriate.  But I loved Mary Wickes in the minor role of Sister Mary Lazarus, the ancient but tough-as-General MacArthur nun.  I thought she had the best lines in the movie. ("I liked my convent in Vancouver, out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern like some of these newfangled convents.  We didn't have electricity - cold water, bare feet - THOSE were nuns!...it was hell on earth; I loved it!  This place is a Hilton.")  You go, Sister!  Discipline those Pillsbury Dough Boy-soft troops!  Still, I can think of better uses for my time than watching SISTER ACT.  (Sleeping, eating, reading, and writing a negative review of SISTER ACT all come immediately to mind.)  Hey, I love a fun, stupid comedy (e.g., The Pink Panther Strikes Again or Monty Python And The Holy Grail), but because it actually asks us to accept as plausible its preposterous scenario, SISTER ACT is dumber than a lobotomized moron with paralyzed vocal cords.  Making it, of course, the ideal movie for postliterate America.  Whoopi!  (I hear what you're thinking: Why is he always knocking America?  But I'm not!  I'm always criticizing America, and there's a difference: 2 more syllables and 3 more letters!) 
 I have read all of the books in this series prior to reading Sold Out. I enjoyed the series immensely and would have recommended the books to any teenager; however, after reading Sold Out, my opinion has changed. Chloe's initial character was appealing because of her harder edge and atypical image. Unfornunately, as I read the book, I felt as though I was not reading the words of a teenager. The slang was dated, including words such as "groovy" and "pretty tough chick" as if these are typical of today's teenagers. Casual conversation throughout the story was far too structured to be that of teenage lunchtime banter, making the story seem spurious. Also, the issues in this book were either exaggerated or trivial. Few issues that Chloe faced were relatable to teenagers today. The book was trite, dated, melodramatic, and mawkishly sentimental 
 This book is not about how to do yoga. It is not for a beginning yoga student. It is probably of interest more to the yogini who has been practicing for some time and is now pregnant. It may be of interest to Iyengar followers as the photos are all of Iyengar's daughter when she was days before delivering her boy. This is a philosphy book, not a how-to book. The prose is spaced more like poetry so there isn't a lot of content in this book 
 Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest 
 I understand there is a CD rom available which contains four volumes.  Has anyone used this 
 This book is about a girl.  She is 13.  She is going to America  She likes a boy named Lou.  she learns to sew.  she is pretty.  She has a grandmother. she is nice. she is cool 
 If these were free, i'd still would not recommend them, due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings.  It is the discs, I must assume, since my burner works fine with other brands.  Anyway, (now) I think it's best to invest a bit more and get good media.. 
 This book is divided into chapters with different religio-social related themes such as "God", "money", "Power", "Love" etc. For each theme, the author presents a few movies relating to it. It didn't take long to realize that Higgins is a liberal Christian who seems more concerned with political ideologies than the salvation of souls. The values promoted are Christian to a degree but only those that overlap with modern liberalism.   Higgins got annoying fast by constantly criticizing the Church (which I think he means Evangelical Christians) though he doesn't name names. And the reason for the criticism is that they don't uphold the 'true message' of Christianity which is that even more annoying buzz word 'social justice' and liberal ethics in general. Higgins uses the typical method of judging the 'Church' for judging other's behaviors as sinful.   The subtitle "Finding Spiritual Fingerprints in Culturally Significant Films" itself is somewhat disturbing. The movie industry is the last place we should hope to find much true spirituality. It is overridden with everything contrary to Christianity. Saying that some of these movies have the fingerprints of God (I know he doesn't actually say that, but its implied) is to overlook the other prevalent messages in these movies that are ungodly to the core. Even a small amount of arsenic in a glass of water is deadly. So even though I do watch movies, I am very cautious to see much holiness in them.   For as much as I didn't like the book, it did introduce me to some new movies which I have now watched and enjoyed. 
 A monster book of 641 pages. Proof that Eco's editor was already dead, or the book killed him. It is filled with lots of esoteric knowledge and history. Be advised that the translator, William Weaver, does not translate the chapter headings, nor the majority of foreign dialogue. Is he assuming that we read French, or would want to? The inclusion of 8 drawings does not advance the story and you wonder why they were included. They are there possibly solely to annoy the reader. Eco makes the reader feel uneducated by using words and terms no one ever heard before, let alone want to use. And the story suddenly becomes the Italian version of John Knowles' "A Separate Peace." And with this transformation: The hunt for "The Plan" or the Templars' Secret," is just a red herring, the story is not about these long dead French knights. As Eco uses 1960-70's LSD induced stream of consciousness writing style for the last 60 pages, he leads his main character to the Zen-Tao-I Ching conclusion that watching his friend be murdered is all for the best. Perhaps Eco should take his own character's advice and "Ma gavte la nata," and take the cork out

 I bought this book hoping I could find alot of information to start a small hobby farm on my 4 1/2 acres. The description of the book made it sound like it was very informative about raising animals, gardening, etc.  This book does cover all aspects. I wanted ideas on which animals are better to raise and such, particularly goats. I was very dissappointed on the section on farm animals. The writer wrote a bit about cows (probably because he raised them), he mentioned goats in about two sentences. All articles were so short and they were not helpful.  If you want to have a book just to read and not really use as a reference go ahead and purchase it. All the articles I wanted to know were all hard to find, had little information (really no information) and I felt that the writer just gave his own personal opinions and not facts.   For me I was dissappointed and now looking to find another reference guide to help me on my way to have a lovely hobby farm. I needed informtion on gardening, making maple syrup, canning/freezing, raising goats, raising beef cows, raising ducks and so forth. This book was not helpful at all.  :( :(  : 
 I would reccommend this book to no one. I found it hard to follow and boring. The characters instilled no feelings in me, except for apathy, at best. An interesting idea gone boring 
 I agree with the previous reviewer: this recording contains about three minutes of musical bliss.  The rest of it is self-conscious and belabored 
 I'm very anxious for my next step towards spiritual evolution, and am tired of my self-defeating habits and conditioning standing in the way. However, it's taking me so long to get throught the 271 pages of this book that I feel like my life is on hold. The clearly focused explanations, discussion material, meditations, and exercises may be essential building blocks to a new way of being, but somewhere out there my life is waiting 
 For many years I assumed birth order maters - and that this is my unique idea. Ha! And Ha! - respectfully, now I know. But at the time I heard Sulloway's lecture to the Skeptic Society - I was still sympathetic to the idea. Finally someone got it! I thought. However, listening to him, I knew he got it all wrong. I could explain how he is wrong, and yet, he did all that research, he had all those numbers... maybe he is right after all...  Later I found out. See for yourself. And consider buying that issue of JPS. I have it, it is a worthy reading.  http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/03/born_to_sue.html 
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 The first two Betsy Taylor books were short but packed with humor and action.  I've re-read them both several times, and still love them.  This one? It seems like she whipped it off in less than a month, and didn't put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others.  The plot is thin, the characters far less developed, and the book is overall a disappointment, especially in light of how excellent her first two Vampire Queen books were.  Sadly, the fourth book in the series, Undead and Unreturnable, is even worse.  I advise anyone wanting to read either Unappreciated or Unreturnable to get them from the library--they are not worth buying.  Try Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking instead, or Katie McAlister's You Slay Me if you want something lighter, and hope that MJD gets her act together and starts writing well again 
 Sigh. I have read a lot of Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels by women writers. In fact, when I see a title by Carol Berg, Lois McMaster Bujold, J.V. Jones, Kate Elliot and a host of other women authors, I automatically order it because I know it will be a fully realized story with complex characters and a sense of immersion. I tried this book because it came up on my recommendations and assumed it would fall into this same type of writing.  Nope. This thing reads like a classic Harlequin Romance(tm). The perky, struggling heroine from the 'wrong side of the station' with a soft spot for orphans and stuffed animals meets (I kid you not) a tall, dark and handsome mysterious stranger who is More Than He Appears. They immediately notice the other has (insert ALL the romantic cliche descriptions) and spend most of their time feeling intense sexual attraction until they (of course) tear each other's clothes off...... Did I mention she has bad luck with men and he is More Than He Appears? Or perhaps the direct rip-off of the C3PO droid from Star Wars.... This is one of the VERY few books I actually am not going to finish. If you actually enjoy Harlequin Romances, more power to you. This book might be for you. But, be warned. That is ALL there is in this story. The author actually could write good stories- this is clear. In fact, as a 'pure romance' novel, it's not bad, I suppose, hence the two stars.  I just look for more than burning glances, constant full body contact encounters and 'accidentally' copping a feel in the repair conduit to move a story along. 
 I'm a big fan of both Perdido Street Station and The Scar, compared to these earlier works Iron Council was a huge disappointment in both the writing and story.  It was at times very painful to read and I was so excited to finally be finished.  If you are new to Mieville, start with Perdido Street Station, if you are a big fan and looking for more from New Crobuzon be prepared to be disappointed 
 I strongly disagree with the other reviewers who are posting positive comments about this book. My review is based upon the previous edition of Heron's book, which was published in 2005 by Xulon Press; however, I highly doubt that the flaws I am pointing out will have been corrected for this new edition. Therefore, I wish to warn others about the shoddy research that Heron presents for his argument. If someone has read the current edition of the book and finds that these mistakes have been corrected, then please let me know and I will adjust my review accordingly.  To begin, I would like to point out that some of Heron's supposed "facts" about the Great Pyramid of Giza are incorrect. This is further compounded because he uses these details at the beginning of his book to build up his grand theory that the pyramid (and all ancient pyramids for that matter) are diabolical deceptions created by Satan to mimic the Holy City of God. For instance, Heron uses outdated information from Clarence Larkin as his source that the Great Pyramid consisted over over 2.3 million blocks weighing an average of 2.5 tons apiece. However, more recent quarry evidence suggests that perhaps only 1.3 million blocks were used or even less (some estimate only 750,000) weighing an average of 1.6 tons.  Another grievous error is that Heron states matter-of-factly that the "Hebrew cubit" measures 25.025 inches (again, based upon Larkin's data, which was, unsurprisingly, based upon the flawed research of others). However, there's no such thing as the 25.025 inch Hebrew cubit. Any reputable source will tell you that that measurement of a cubit used by the Hebrews varied between approximately 17.49 inches and 20.67 inches. Additionally, since we are talking about an Egyptian pyramid, we should be dealing with Egyptian cubits (the royal cubit was approx. 20.61 inches) -- not Hebrew cubits.  Heron then goes on to use this so-called 25.025 inch "Hebrew cubit" as the base unit of measure to reveal that the length of each side of the pyramid's base equals 365.2422 cubits. He argues that this demonstrates that the Great Pyramid had the number of days in the solar calendar built into its design. This might sound impressive but it's flat wrong if you do any real calculations based upon measurements by credentialed Egyptologists. He's only doing it to make his data look more impressive.  Taking it another step further, Heron tells us that these measurements of the Great Pyramid can be used to successfully "square the circle" -- and he even provides the equations to demonstrate it. First, he shows how the pyramid incorporates an approximation of the value for Pi (3.14159 -- note: Heron's version is rounded to 3.1416) Then, he does some more fancy math to make it seem as though the perimeter of the pyramid's base equals the diameter of a circle that is twice the height of the pyramid. Here are the exact equations provided by Heron:  1) 365.242 x 4 =  14609.68 2) 232.52 x 2 x 3.1416 = 14609.68  But there are some BIG problems with the equations that Heron has given to us. First, he is sloppy and has misplaced the decimal point TWICE. If you actually care to check the calculation, you will find that the first answer should be 1460.968. The second equation actually results in a more precise value of 1460.9696. Heron has therefore rounded the six up (but to a value of 8 instead of 7!!!) to make it appear as if the final answers match precisely. But he makes it even worse because that's not the only place where he rounded. Recall that I said he rounded the value for Pi up to 3.1416 (instead of the familiar 3.14159). Heron purposely rounded this value UP because the normal value would make the result for his second equation come out to 1460.965. But since he wants to have this answer "match" his first equation, he needs an excuse to round the value up -- and he gets it by using the rounded value of Pi.  I know that this might sound like I am being too critical of the man, but I'm not. I think that this truly shows how sloppy of a job he has done with his research. On top of that, his padding of these numbers to make them match suggests that he is purposely misleading his readers. Please remember, he is telling his readers that there is such remarkable precision built into the Great Pyramid that no human could have constructed it -- it MUST have been that nasty old Satan! Heron uses these "facts" and math equations to "prove" his argument and bases his whole theory around them. But if those building blocks are all wrong then so is the bulk of the theory proposed by his book.  There are many other mistakes I found while reading Heron's work, such as when he refers to the word "Lucifer" as being HEBREW for "morning star" -- when it is actually LATIN (the Hebrew term would be "Helel ben Shakar"). I have elaborated upon the above material within an appendix of my own book, Gateway of the Gods, where I also demonstrate flaws in the research of another popular author, Zecharia Sitchin. However, I'm not going to get into all of that here because it's not the purpose of this review, nor do I want this to seem as though I am merely trying to promote my own book. Suffice to say that I think the above should demonstrate reason enough why readers should avoid this book and save their money 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
 I was very disappointed by the lack of useful information in this book. Nothing was presented that you couldn't find with a simple key word search of the internet. I had hoped for useful suggestions, interesting insight, maybe some tips for making the experience more enjoyable. Instead it read like a glossary of the toys. If you already know what hardware there is available this book won't be much help. It didn't even have suggestions about which toy might be superior for which purpose. I was hoping for a more comprehensive treatment of the act and how it could enhance the bond between my lover and myself. This book was more like an quick overview stretched out for 100 pages. There was great potential in this often unexplored topic but the book decided not to delve into it 
 this is really the dumbest thing ive ever seen. YU Gi Oh is such a rip off. get something good.   * Anime Princess Chick * - age 1 
 I have to admit that I gave up on this book.  I'm hoping to find a more readable biography of Mrs. Roosevelt.  Cook's style and grammar are just too jumbled for me.    Look in the "look inside this book" section here and go to page 14.  This is a prime example of Cook's overuse of quotes.  I appreciate that she did her research, but if she was going to quote so much, she should have just included one whole article.  As it is, the whole page is a mish-mash of sentances and words taken from various sources creating a confusing unreadable mess.   
 This is a cute phone, though the voice is slightly obnoxious.  The thing that really bothers me is that when you press the moon/pound button, it plays the tune of "This Old Man" in one key (E-flat) while the voice sings it in ANOTHER KEY (B).  It's atrocious.  And this WILL be your child's favorite button to press, because kids love music, no matter how awful it is 
 On his website, Professor Stephen Hawking claims he did NOT authorize the publication of this book under his name 
 The thing that frustrates me about the author is how he professes to be a Christian when he appears on various Christian shows  yet his book pretty much pushes his over priced and in my opinion, needless supplements, which are  lacking in Biblical value in my opinion.    Does one who believes in God, honestly think that God would create high cost supplements that only well off Christians could buy, thus ignoring the millions of people in all countries who often can barely afford a bowl of oatmeal?    How about getting people to simply eat inexpensive whole foods and get more free exercise in the form of walking?   How about using some common sense and realize that modern high fat, low nutrient foods aren't healthy, and that eating less, getting enough sleep and drinking enough plain water does wonders.    And if you do need more energy start with a whole B complex vitamin from your local health food store. And if you want some healthy whole foods, recipes get the book A Mediterranean Feast by Clifford A. Wright.  All I need do is read up on Biblical history and that people ate less, walked more, consumed little meat, but more fish, and didn't have all the modern day toys and gadgets that we have that not only make life more stressful, but people more lazy. 
 I'm from Villa Grove.  I liked our town better with the siren 
 This book is totally outdated, not detailed enough, and completely vague. I had to refer to other advertising books when I read this book because it was so BAD! Everthing in this book was really vague and the authors contradict themselves. One minute they reccommend a particular stragety--the next minute they say the strategy doesn't work--therefore it becomes confusing and not detailed enough. Do not buy this book because it is a waste of money and it is completely outdated--old school information, which is useless 
 The authors seemed to spend more time asking you if you really, really, really want to get a poodle, considering all the work and money they take, than on giving valuable information.  Not very helpful to those of us who already have a poodle and want to learn more about our dog/puppy, and caring for them.  It does have chapters on care and grooming, etc, but for the first several chapters it seemed to be cautioning people away from getting a poodle, at least that was the impression I had 
 I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time.  I couldn't force myself to get to the end.  Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't.  The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable.  I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
 I heard the author interviewed on the radio and he said he'd written a chapter and a half when he realized he was writing the Count of Monte Cristo (but since Dumas stole the story he figured could to).  I should have re-read Dumas's classic instead.  This isn't a classic.  Somehow it isn't as rich in details.  The original was very complicated.  This is thin, flat and unsatisfying.  Somehow Fry's story has more white space in the text, you just feel you are missing out on the beautiful details and plot twists and complexity of characters.  Dumas made each act of revenge seem fitting.  Fry makes it seems just dirty and petty.  Dumas had characters with doubt, Fry has characters too flat to doubt.  Go read Dumas, the (original) book was better 
 I bought this toaster for about $11, so I did not expect much. I haven't tried it yet, so I can't say how it works, but I want to warn potential buyers that if you buy a reconditioned item, it can come with some parts missing. Mine came without a cookie sheet and a little thingie for pulling hot trays out. Also, the dials are somewhat misaligned. Not a big deal, especially given the price, but had I bought it for more money, I would've been pissed 
 Having read - and absolutely loved  - Ms. Gilman's hilarious memoir, "Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress", I naturally expected this book to be a great read as well.  I was sorely disappointed.  Ms. Gilman's sassy style gets lost in a sea of trite "you-go-girl" cliches.  As the pages turn, Gilman's voice just gets angrier and angrier.  Every other sentence is prefaced with "Yeah, well..."  The writing is terrible, the editing is sloppy...I could go on forever.  Grandmother's quotes were wonderful, but otherwise, this book was difficult to take.  Gilman makes it abundantly clear that only as long as you share her extremely liberal views - this coming from someone who considers herself moderately liberal - can you make it into the Goddess Club.   After the first twenty or so pages it began to irritate me.  This is not a manifesto on how to cultivate some "girl power" and exercise it, but rather an excuse for Ms. Gilman to hop on her soapbox and rant.  I would suggest skipping this shallow read.  
 The author wastes way too many words on the religious views of David Koresh.  Who cares about that?  Religion is nonsense in any form.  I wanted much more about the government's malfeasance 
 I am not writing in English and try to learn some fiction writing skills. This book has cited many literay fiction and is a good source for you to find fictions good at dialogue, etc. But it provides very few techniques and you have to read  the referred literature to know how to write a dialogue. I jumped many paragraphs. I also can not agree with the author on what attract the readers. Sometimes I feel the opposite about certain classics. Other books I am reading provide me with many techniques such as Techniques of Selling Writer and Immediate Fiction 
 My primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. The camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). The camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. Maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. I believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.  I used to have a Cannon PowerShot SD450 that was awesome, but it was stolen and so I needed a replacement. I had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900. I am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose, this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. Instead, I just got a Fuji Finepix F30, which is supposed to be better without the flash. We'll see 
 I have followed NASA and the space program since I was a child, and have been waiting for years for a definitive biography to be written about Neil Armstrong. I bought this book the day it came out, and eagerly began reading it, only to have my eagerness rapidly turn to disappointment. Wagener is clearly writing on subject matter far outside his field of expertise, and commits many mistakes, misspellings, and factual inaccuracies to paper in this book. I was exasperated when Wagener constantly referred to Neil as a "jet ace" in Korea (he does not know what the term actually means, apparently), but was really appalled when he kept calling the "Lunar Module" the "Landing Module." The point to be made by these two (of many) examples is that if these are the errors I caught, how credible is the remainder of the book? How many errors did I miss? Surely the most egregious gaffe is putting the famous lunar photo of Aldrin on the cover of the book. I don't know why the publisher didn't have an astronaut or pilot review the manuscript for accuracy, but that would certainly be an excellent idea before a second edition is published. I am surprised that astronaut Bill Pogue, a relative contemporary of Armstrong, would endorse this book on the back cover.   To his credit, Wagener attempts to chronicle Armstrong's entire life from childhood to the present, and does manage to include a lot of relatively unknown information on Armstrong. I am sympathetic with the author's plight, in that while not a recluse, Armstrong is an intensely private man, which makes material and background information infinitely more difficult to gather. Obviously this is not an "authorized" biography with participation from Neil, but does cite several friends and acquaintances of Neil in the text. The pre and post Apollo 11 information is most interesting, and is the best work in the book. I have no doubt that the general storyline of the book is correct, but wish that I could find corroboration for some of the information presented here.   Certainly there are many better books on Apollo, if that is your primary interest: I particularly recommend books by Chaikin, Cunningham, Collins, and Lovell (who, amazingly, the author wrongly blames for the Apollo 13 accident) for very engaging accounts of the Apollo program, and the excellent Apogee Apollo Mission Reports series for technical information. Unfortunately if you want a biography of Neil Armstrong, you are pretty much stuck with this one. Hopefully sometime in the future a historian with a gift for writing will gain Armstrong's confidence and a genuinely authoritative biography will result; Neil Armstrong is an American hero and frankly deserves better than this.  
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Don't get me wrong: Jeph Loeb, chief writer on DC's terrific "Superman/Batman" series, has done outstanding work with these two players -- the rock solid foundation of the DC Universe ... but VENGEANCE -- by its bitter anticlimax -- feels very much like a conglomeration of ideas instead of one masterful story from start to finish.  Loeb begins with a Super-opening: Superman and Batman appear from a Boom Tube (don't ask, you've just gotta know what one is to really appreciate what happens here)and kill a superhero called Skyscraper who presumably murdered Lois Lane; incensed and out for vengeance, the Maximums -- this world's Justice League -- vow to hunt the Man of Steel and the World's Greatest Detective to the ends of whatever universe they inhabit in order to have their revenge ... and right there -- at least for me -- is where this story FELT like it wasn't going to be quite right: superheroes represent the best any world has to offer, and these Maximums want vengeance.  They want blood.  They want to kill Batman and Superman for taking one of their comrades away.  Honestly, right there, I was wondering if this was a tale for me.  Not too many pages later, I'm struggling to get through the mental and verbal gibberish of not only Bizarro but Batzarro, and I'm thinking, "Geez, Jeph Loeb really needs some time off."  VENGEANCE isn't a total loss.  Loeb's a great writer with a fantastic imagination and an uncanny ability to seal himself inside the minds of these two superheroes to show the reader what makes them tick, and only from his learned hands can you find so many wonderful moments in an otherwise forgettable story.  There's not only two worlds at play here; there are, quite possibly, dozens, as Supermen, Batmen, Supergirls, Batboys, and the like show up from earnest supporting appearances.  Granted, it may not make a whole lot of sense, but even THAT makes sense once you find out which dastardly villains are behind this whole world-hopping, mind-blowing affair.  Yes, it's worth a read, and, yes, it's arguably worth forgetting.  Remember the little moments along the way, and keep your fingers crossed for Loeb to appear in top form again real, real soon 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 this is the worst performance i've ever seen. i guess this is a pilot for a tv-show that wasnt picked up. good riddance 
 Be warned. Most of the songs on this set are not the original recordings.  Most appear to be re-recorded in the 1990s as is the case for all of these ZYZ 2-CD collections under the heading The World of Italian Hits.  The songs in this collection lack the charm of those found in the 50s and 60s Collections. In those collections, there are greats songs, well sung and tastefully arranged, that sound like they are straight out of the Italian-language section of a fakebook of any band that has played at an Italian-American wedding in the past 40 years. And for that reason, there is a lot of charm.  Much the 70s stuff has a certain cheesy element, as was typical of much US disco music of that same period.  The nadir of this collection is a  very sad 90s era re-recording of L'Arca di Noe by the legendary Sergio Endrigo, one of the all time songwriter/singers of Italian popular music. Apparently, this great artist was in poor health when he recorded this song, one of his many masterpieces. Here, his intonation and tone are very bad. What a pity! ZYX should have left that cut out. If  you want to hear Endrigo at the height of his powers, buy is Giri 45 double-CD collection or even better, get the L'Arca di Noe of his 1970 concert in Milano. A classic!  I would have given the collection three stars but am registering my disapproval with this lower rating 
 I read TR's books and they changed my life-when I was 13. I thought that what TR said about the soul being light as a feather was so very deep. Not the second time around. Really, let's be serious. I think you have to have an IQ of about 70 in  order for that to happen. He has the same cutesy prose as Dennis Fariña, who only got published because he knew the right people. TR writes about sex like a creepy, impotent old man. You know, like Robert Heinlein.  At least Heinlein's female characters have talents other than (....). AND his stories are cool. I'll take A Confederacy of Dunces or any of Lynda Barry's books any day. And I like Dave Barry too, as far as dorky older white dudes are concerned. I still like beets though 
 I bought this book to use in a class, but I only read four pages before giving up because it was just too much to read. Get a magnifying glass people. This book is written in fine print. You'd think they would publish it in a font that would comfortable to read. For that reason alone I returned it in favor of another 
 This book really takes a deeper look at how challenges and adveristies affect you. It definatly makes a connection with the reader and it is very helpfull. The author speaks to you as though you are having a conversation and offers some wonderfull advice. I would highly reccomend this book 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 Some continents (Europe, Asia, and Australia) are deliniated incorrectly. I would not want my kids to be misinformed about basic geographic concepts 
 After reading the first four books in this series, I picked up this one, thinking that I would enjoy it just as much.  Oh, how I hate it when I'm wrong...  There was just nothing there to hold my interest.  It was.... well, boring!  I didn't care one bit about the characters or what happened to any of them.    Maybe it got better toward the end, but I can't say for sure.  I think I was about 100 - 130 pages into it and just trying to force myself through.  So - I decided to stop.    Sorry Piers 
 This book is dangerous.  It does not present an overall method (or even practical starting points) for treating people with depression. Throughout the passages the author seems to be speaking to himself and his dead sons as much as to the reader.  It gives readers 30 anecdotal and ideological glimpses into the disorder and it's treatment. This probably does more harm than good in the long run.   I think many readers are likely to start practicing arm-chair psychiatry . . . "it is reasonable to confront them [patients] with the selfishness and anger implied in any act of self-destruction . . ." What a dangerous (angry? guilty?) generalization!  Dealing with depression takes a "patient-centered" approach. Confrontation MAY have it's place, but later in THERAPY. And even then being dependent on multiple factors (patient-doctor relationship, in-patient vs. out-patient, support networks, patient himself).   Someone suffering from depression may get useful insights out of this book. It should NOT be read by family or friends looking for help dealing with a depressed person. 
 ...I turned the movie off. Was that supposed to be funny? Yes, some kids' toy (that happens to be a small motorized/electric model of a truck) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village -I mean; was this taken from the original Stephen King-book then shame on you Mr.King -that's overdoing the terror already so overdone.   Not that the consept of "Trucks" didn't appeal to me, but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so-called horrormaster so far -believe it or not 
 I have yet to use an actual phrase from this guide, but... it is good for re-charging my batteries when I have to write a review and feel uninspired.  After reading through some ideas in this guide, I usually find I can then find my own words to say what I need to convey.  The fact that all the phrases are positive, I see as a good thing because I feel it's important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you're reviewing.  If there are challenges in the persons performance, the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period.  I would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing... rather than use the phrases in the book. The people we manage deserve more than "copy/paste" reviews.  
 This is not like the "Knit Stitch" or "Purl Stitch" books of Melville's, which I love.  I found no patterns that I cared to knit, and few that I felt I would even want to attempt.  It's promoted as having patterns that get rid of your stash, but most patterns do this by weaving in small amounts of various colors.  You will still need to have large quantities of a basic color for many of these patterns.  I will be getting rid of my book, unfortunately.  Check this out a library first to see if these patterns are what you like 
 This is certainly the worst of it. At least Lil Jon has good beats and stuff. This has none of that, and it is just annoying. Support better artists 
 This has been rewritten to dumb it down.  The beautiful language originally used by him has been replaced with dumber versions, and entire paragraphs have been removed.  As someone who read and loved the original story as a child, I was very disappointed to see this when I began reading it to my 7 year old son 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 Geisler stresses that we must have an objective test for the truth of a world-view. He posits the test of undeniability and unaffirmability. Namely, whatever is undeniable is true, and whatever is unaffirmable is false.   He then says that he'll show that every world-view except Theism is unaffirmable, and that Theism is the only affirmable and undeniable world-view.   Then Geisler discards the test in the very next chapter when he deals with Deism! He never shows how Deism is unaffirmable, but only that it's "inadequate" (p 171).   He criticizes Deism as inconsistent for believing that God doesn't intervene in the world by saying that once the Deist accepts Creation he must also accept the possibility of other miracles. Even if this is granted, this doesn't automatically mean that miracles happen! The possible does not equal the actual Mr. Geisler!  He also claims that "if God was concerned enough about man to create him, it would seem to follow that he would be concerned enough to intervene on his behalf." Thank you for your opinion Mr. Geisler, but why don't you show instead how the position is "unaffirmable" as you promised?   The first section of the book is worth the read but I give it 1 star because it completely failed to meet it's objective of showing all non-theisms unaffirmable and theism as undeniable.  
 Okay,  This is not a review of the product itself. But, I strongly encourage you to consider not getting an N.E.W warranty. They are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things.   If you had anything to do with the device not working (e.g. you dropped it, forget about it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever.)   They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginia(of course you have to pay for the shipping!)  Lastly, they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N.E.W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N.E.W will take months to pay them for the work they did.  If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it 
 I have liked older Nanci Griffith a great deal. This is not those albums. I also have great affection for the protest singers of the 60s and 70s, but this is not that, either. Gee, war is bad, Nanc? Thanks for pointing that out. The lyrics on this one have all the profundity of a slightly slow 12 year old. As someone with degrees in English and Women's Studies, I was insulted by "Back When Ted Loved Sylvia." The track where Nanci tries scat-singing sounds like she is being poked with a sharp stick. Throughout, I was very surprised someone on the staff producing this did not point out that changing your vocal timbre and volume drastically in the space of three notes is jarring and unpleasant. Very very unimpressive 
 I am a fan of Shillington and I expected more from this book. His effort to glorify African leaders and condemn Europeans makes this text biased and inaccurate. I would recommend Blaine Harden's "Africa: Dispatches from a Fragile Continent.&quot 
 In previous reviews the aspect ratio of this DVD set is often mentioned. I have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong. It may be true that the series was shot in 16:9 and I remember seeing it that way on Belgium TV, but this is not that version! When watching these DVDs it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong: the top of people's heads are frequently cut off, sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible. I also own the Dutch DVD-set of this great series which has 4:3 aspect ratio, no extras but very cheap, less than $10,00. Comparison showed that the Signature Editon used the 4:3 version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a 16:9 version. Again, if the series was originally shot in 16:9 than this is not that version! Shame on you HBO for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called Special Edition 
 there are pros and cons of this card.  PROS- its stores a lot of memory able to save many files at one time compact affordable  CONS- games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save! sometimes crashes.  i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory. if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car 
 I was not pleased with this CD - I wanted hymns rendered more joyously.... 
 God, I can't believe this guy. Ja Rule was never a gangsta in his life, he can't talk gangsta. And stop trying to be like Tupac, Tupac actually was a gangsta. Your a fake and if he was still alive he would not only not role with you but diss you so badly you'd wet your pants. This guy should be booted out of the game, not only his he lying when he talks all this gangsta s*** as if he went through it, his ruining hip hop. Yeah and Ja, stop dissing Eminem and 50. You know perfectly well that they'd kill you in a battle anyday. Ja Rule has always been s***. Go listen to real rap 
 Cruel, horrible story with a typical Barr convoluted plot. The abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me. I've read many Barr books, and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters, it's hard to keep them straight. In this book, that was the last of my worries. I didn't even finish it, I was so turned off 
 Grant's Dissector leaves much to be desired.  The dissection instructions are not all that clear nor are the drawings that great.  It seems to skip around a lot with the dissection.  It also mentions a lot of structures to look for which aren't in the drawings.  I would recommend the authors reconsider their layout.  I would also consider looking at other dissectors if you are looking to buy one 
 THe story of glodilocks is more than just story that will put your child to sleep.  If one reads deeper into the story they can find morals instilled.  These fairytales are a great way to teach young children many lessons.  Depending on the version read one may be able to extract many different views.  Not only does it depnd on the authors views but also the background of the reader(you 
 Mcmurtrys new album really disappoints.  I am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with James past work (as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical).  While Mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza (See the Elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we Americans spend our time (Holiday), his attempts on Childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing.  In past attempts Mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of Americana, yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside. The thoughtfulness evaporated on this work.   Like many aging musicians, Mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse.  The cliche and empty "We Cant Make It Here" is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility.  Mcmurtry, previously able to frame an issue, seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills.   Criticism is not intelligence, and we can only hope that Mcmurtry can get on track going forward.  Perhaps he should shun the  "PC Crowd" and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial American Scene for his next album 
 Hey, I love those B&W "B" movies, but this one should be called the scorpion with no tail!  It starts out with some good tension and what looks to be some good character development.  Then we get some preposterous situations.  The punch to this movie is the awful special effects!  They should have left out the stupid close-ups of the drippy-mouthed scorpion!  I lost track of how many times they showed that SAME close-up, and it never matched the rest of the scene that was occurring at the time.  Hello editor!  I guess I was supposed to be so busy screaming with horror that I wouldn't notice how cheesy it was.  Sorry, I was too busy falling asleep on this dog! Get "Them" or "The Lost World" or "The War of the Worlds" (or even "The Blob" if you can handle cheesy special effects with a decent plot and decent characters) 
 I can not comment on a book that I have not received yet 
 What a disappointment!  Every time it gets hot, it cuts straight to the end.  The movie is entirely foreplay!!  
 The reading was okay, but there wasn't much meat to it. Each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. Only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. One of the most interesting pages told about how Disney bought up all of the FL property using fictitious companies. For the price, I was disappointed as most of it is not notable. If you're a Disney buff, get this from the library and save the $$$ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting 
 According to the intro at the back cover, it sounded really interesting.  I thought it would be really funny and with excitment.  However, to my disappointment, I could hardly believe I finished the whole book.  I was about to give up after the second chapter.  I have never read a book this boring.  The storyline in the book is very fragile.  Talking about someone stole her identity was just a slightly touch.  The main story lies on her strugle with the wedding of her younger brother.  There were too many unnecessary subplots and it made you go insane.  You really do not see why and how these subplots fit into the book or how it made a difference in Cyn (the main character) who just stole someone's identity.  I think this book is really a crap.  Don't be fooled.... 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 The premise for this book had so much potential--examining cultural differences regarding time--but the execution was horrendous.  The wholescale condemnation of all things "Western," "phallic," "linear" and "masculine," and the unilateral and uncritical praise for "indigenous" cultures reminded me of a freshman in their first college seminar: juvenile, naive, and accusatory.  She praises what she terms the feminine and damns anything masculine.  I found this reductive and insulting.  I am an avowed feminist, but I believe this kind of devisive thinking to be harmful and destructive.    Furthermore, Griffiths is an awful writer.  She is cutesy, smug, self-congratulatory, and badly organized.  Her one thesis seems to be "clock time, bad!" and never moves much beyond that.  There are many other authors, such as Linda Hogan, who can write poetically and also politically, but Jay Griffiths is not one of them.    Avoid this self-important book and its hypocritical, accusatory author.  Direct your precious time elsewhere 
 Robert Shank's thesis is that election in the Bible is primarily a corporate concept.  That is, God predestines no one to heaven unconditionally, but only predestines the church to be saved; whether or  not one is part of the church is left to the freewill of the individual.   Unfortunately, Robert Shank's work falls drastically short of Dr. William  W. Adam's promise that it would prove to be "the definitive work on  the difficult question of election."  In fact, Shanks treatment of the  doctrine of predestination suffers some tremendous flaws.  The book was  obnoxiously repetitive and burdened by run-on sentences. Furthermore,  Shank's exegetical arguments were disappointingly weak.  He seemed to see  Arminian prooftexts like 1 Tim. 2:4 and Ezek. 18:23 as hermeneutical keys  used unlock the meaning of every passage in the Bible that did not appear  to fit with his thesis.  As a result, Calvinistic arguments were swept  under the rug with no real wrestling with the Biblical tension between  human responsibility and divine sovereignty.  Compelling Calvinistic  arguments were brushed aside by simple appeals to verses that indicate that  God desires all men to be saved.  There was virtually no interaction with  scholarly literature outside that of John Calvin, which is a major flaw of  the book.  Surprisingly, very little attention is devoted to Rom. 9:1-23 -  this fact alone reveals a major shortcoming of Shanks work.  The case for  corporate election is not argued strongly from texts like Eph. 1 but is  simply assumed.  It is astounding that Shank's book has received as much  popularity as it has.  Overall, I found the book lacking in verbal clarity,  even-handed exegesis, interaction with Calvinistic literature, thoroughness  and philosophical persuasiveness.  I don't recommend that anyone buy this  book, even for the sake of learning about Arminianism.  Better ones are  available 
 Recently I completed teaching a seven week series on the sacraments. As I prepared my studies and made a short list of resources that I wanted to make available to those studying with me, I asked myself "Now, regarding baptism, what kind of book do I need?"   		What I needed was a single volume that constructs its case out of a close reading of the biblical data, that interacts with well-known objections in a clear but polite manner, and that sets forth the mainlines of covenant theology in such a way as to show how infant baptism properly belongs to that system and to the life of the Christian church. What I choose was The Case for Covenantal Baptism.   		Written by a number of respected pastors and professors serving in various Reformed and evangelical settings, The Case for Covenantal Baptism does not break new ground, but it does offer substantial discussions of key biblical passages (e.g. Mt.28:18-20; Ac.2:39; Rom.4:11-12; 6:3-6; Heb.8:11-12; Jer.31; et.al). Further, it places the discussion of paedo-baptism (and the debate surrounding it) firmly within the covenantal context of Scripture. While some differences among the contributing authors are evident, yet for the most part this volume is remarkably even and coherent. Certainly it does make a clear case for covenantal baptism as well as offering theological and pastoral insight on the place of children in the Old and New Testaments and in the congregation.  		Although there are now several good books on infant baptism available, yet I believe this articulate and constructive volume will be of benefit to pastors desirous of instructing their congregations in the sacraments. It will also be of value to seminary graduates heading into the pastorate and to continuing seminary students as a supplement to lectures. Finally, The Case for Covenantal Baptism should also prove helpful and therefore be appreciated by those studying this issue and endeavoring to make up their minds about the biblical validity of this precious practice.  
 This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.  This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 I admit that I'm far from an expert on digital cameras. I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.  I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'  I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.  That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.  What else can I say about this camera:  This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.  It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.  I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.  When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. Like I said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?  I wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that Canon makes if you want my personal opinion. Think about that. You have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still UNDER warranty. That's disgusting, that's all I have to say.  There should be a ZERO for this, not a 1 star 
 "Our Kind," Kate Walbert's novel-in-stories about the psychological malaise afflicting women who became adults in the 1950s and who are now confronting life in their 60s, never achieves its intriguing premise.  Walbert's individual stories lack coherence; her prose tends to be overwritten, precious or overly obscure; her characters rarely invite sympathy or compassion, much less understanding.  Though Walbert intends "Our Kind" to provide insight into the genuine existential dilemmas aging women experience, the novel is really little more than a litany of sorror that poor little rich girls  --  now women  -- encounter.  Each character, whether she be physically disabled, ditzy, an artist, a widow, cancer-stricken, jaded or booze-addled, has been "led down a primrose lane, then abandoned somewhere near the carp pond."  Forsaking intellectual aspirations and career possibilities contemporary women now presume as birthrights, these erudite, Smith-educated, polished (like prized apples) and repressed (orgasm-starved) characters chose or had chosen for them a life of taking "dictation from war heroes in grey suits."  Their college curriculum consisted of the "3 G's:  Grace, Grooming and Grammar.  Some of us dropped out before Grace."  They did everthing their men asked them to:  be homemakers, silent hostesses, acquiescent sexual partners and mothers.  Yet, somewhere, by middle age, the wheels had fallen off.  The women of "Our Kind" keen with pain and betrayal.  Their collective voices form a chorus of sorrow and lament, not the presupposed aria of joy, contentment and fulfillment they had envisioned hearing.  "Our Kind" is a filled with an ineluctable sadness and no small amount of unresolved bitterness.  The women, budding with excitement in their 20s, now have gone to seed.  And what a disparate assortment of seeds...hair greying, unspoken anger bubbling over, regrets denouncing false hopes.  Their loneliness slaps them daily across their reconstructed faces.  Each character, because of Walbert's preculiar, ill-chosen style, never fully articulates her angst.  Yet, we can imagine them in their earlier lives, seated at their elegantly-arranged dinner tables, designing and executing parties to further their husands' careers, painfully aware that genuine conversations (like those savored with their professors in the Seven Sister Colleges) will never involve them.  Their very lives are in perpetual deferment.  All the elements for significant story telling are here.  Walbert's bon-mots, sprinkled at the end of each chapter ("our hearts worn down by the slow drumming of blood," "we are...a school of fish too old to spawn but desperate to swim back upstream"), indicate a writer with great talent.  Yet, "Our Kind" disappoints.  Its structure, lack of narrative drive and choice of affluent, suburban, east-coast women (far removed from most American women's experiences) doom to the novel to be as satisfying as a furtive tryst with a hired pool boy 
 I bought this book and hoped it had a comprehensive view of world history.  Sadly, it does not.  First, I looked up World War II to find the name of the Japanese leader who ordered the kamikaze pilots to bomb Pearl Harbor.  Only six pages are devoted to World War II and, since half of each page is graced with a huge photo, really only three pages of actual text (which is a huge font as well).  Absolutely no mention of Japan's part in World War II and only a picture of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima without any further explanation.    Second, we read a Scientific American article on the DNA identification of victims left after the Serbian-Croatian War in the early 90s.  So, we checked this encyclopedia out for more information on the Serbian-Croatian War.  There was only one line in the summary at the end of the section for that period and it only said that Yugoslavia split into different republics.  There was nothing further on this war that killed so many thousands.    These are two relatively recent and very important parts of history that were not addressed by this book.  From that point on, each topic I checked had nothing or a line or two.  We had avoided the Kingfisher Encyclopedia of World History because so many religious events in history were removed from their text, but this book is even worse.  Don't waste your money or time 
 Time Enough For Love is one Heinlein's most famous books and is representative of his writing style, pacing and world view.  He touches upon many sociological subjects and tackles a number of interesting subjects and taboo mostly related to sex, incest the meaning of love.  That being said, after having his "big three" (Stranger In A Strange Land, The Moon is A Harsh Mistress and TEFL) I personally don't enjoy his work, I can understand why I'm in the minority.  TEFL follows the eternal Lazarus Long through his numerous adventures as he recounts his life while looking for reason to continue living.  The novel is divided up into four main sections uneven in length in quality.  There are times when Heinlein is right on target, examining social constructs, where they came from and how we deal with them.  Then there are times when there isn't much going on.  I think my two biggest problems with the novel were its structure and main character.  The makeup of the novel didn't lead to enough events happening nor did it produce any type of conflict normally needed to produce tension.  The novel is extensively dialogue driven and Shakespeare this is not.  Asimov got it right by mixing dialogue driven characters with at least some action but there is really very little going on in TEFL.  The one story that has some semblance of dramatic events (The Adopted Child) is clearly everyone's favorite.  As the main character Lazarus Long is lacking.  I kept drawing parallels between him and another famous fictional character: Lestat de Lioncourt from Rice's Vampire novels.  Both obviously share the immortal parallel but Lestat's personality and flaws made him much more interesting as a character.  Perhaps Long is a characterization of Heinlein himself and as we all know fiction is better then reality.  This book was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula in 1974.  A particularly amazing year with Clark's Rendezvous With Rama and Niven's Protector also in the mix.  Rendezvous is in a whole different playing field then the rest and won both awards hands down and deservedly so.  Bottom Line:  Maybe a must read for Heinlein aficionados and readers of classic sci-fi but this just doesn't work as social sci-fi for me.  Also the book is just too long 
 so i bought this item and i hated it. I wash my hair everyday and it completly dryed out my hair! it does smell good though but other than that ive used it about 4 times and thats all it took to realize this is just not for me 
 This is supposed to be an advanced book.  If I was looking to learn how to put on a c-collar or a KED I'll buy the BTLS book and take that class.  This is supposed to be part of an EMT-P curriculum.  If a paramedic student does not know these things they should be looking elsewhere for a career.  Take the space given for these basic skills and put in some realavent information for advanced providers.  Keep this topic interesting and challenging instead of wasting time with basic first-aid and first responders skills.  We know this stuff! Now we want more!  Everything aside from the waste of time and paper on the basics is actually really great information.  I just want more of it 
 Used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off, you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but don't count on it. Then again it could have just been mine 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 I heard alot about Robert Anton Wilson and I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book. The point of this book is to teach the reader to look at the world with a new perspective. Wilson accomplishes this only moderately, if at all. After the first 10 pages I was very interested in his ideas about the mind, how people think, and how that relates to the world psyche. After 50 pages I thought there is definitely a fine line between genius and insanity. This book straddles the line. Wilson seems very intelligent at times, and at other times, he seems like he's been smoking too much pot. He even has excercises at the end of each chapter to expand your mind, some of which include getting stoned and just thinking (or meditating, chanting) ridiculous things.   The fact that this book is so popular proves that there are many, many people who aren't firing on all cylinders or at least don't know where else to search for fresh and challenging ideas. I agree that meditation and other holistic methods can affect your quality of life and broaden your mind, but Wilson's case for it makes it seem like maybe his mind expansion project went a little to far. It's an interesting book, but I'm afraid most readers are going to shun the lack of evidence or support for his radical ideas 
 I've been to Italy several times.....Rome, Venice, Florence, Bologna, Milan, some of the hill towns, etc.  Here are my reviews of the best guides to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the public transportation system.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide   
 I LOVE TURKISH BELLY DANCE - SARAH SKINNER  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD if you want to learn anything about Turkish Belly dance! The title and information on the cover will lead the viewer into believing that Turkish Belly dancing is being taught, which it is not. Turkish Belly dance is a dance style with a long and significant history in Turkey. It has exerted a considerable influence on the development of modern American Cabaret Belly dance. However there is no such thing as Turkish Skirt Belly dance and unfortunately both of the choreographies that Sarah chooses to teach are skirt dances. In contradiction to the title, "I Love Turkish Belly dance," she is teaching and performing an American form of Belly dance. Even the cover art is frustrating, as there is not a single image of Sarah wearing Turkish Cabaret or even Turkish historical costuming. Instead the images show her wearing costumes more reminiscent of American Cabaret Belly dance and American Tribal style dance rather than anything seen in Turkey.  Sarah spends a great deal of time on lyric translation. Unfortunately once again, her lack of knowledge concerning Turkish music and dance is exposed. She claims that Mastika is referring to chewing gum, but in the song they are actually referring to the alcoholic drink that is made from the plant of the same name. The viewer would have been better served if she had spent time breaking down the Karsilama or Rromani rhythm which is a 9/8 time signature. She does not clearly explain how to accent the rhythms and never actually counts them out. Her concept of expressing the rhythm verbally during her choreography lessons is to chant boom, boom, boom...boom, boom, for the beat, instead of counting the rhythm out. This is very unprofessional, and not at all useful from an instructional viewpoint. The viewer is left wondering if she ever learned to properly count or accent the Karsilama rhythm; therefore she's unable to use it in instruction. I also miss hearing zills, Sarah doesn't use them in the choreographies and Turkish dancers are historically known for their zills in their performances.  Turkish Belly dance is very high energy and Sarah lacks fire in her personality, choreographies and performance. Her voice is so deliberately soft and gentle that she borders on being insincerely unctuous. Sarah mysteriously chose to perform to a piece of music that is Arabic, which is sung in Arabic and Spanish, which she reassures the viewer that no one will notice! The hip drop that she teaches is not Turkish at all but rather it is Egyptian in styling. In general I find that her choreographies are too sedate, her posture is too relaxed and her isolation's are too slowly executed.  I have several different instructional DVDs from World Dance New York and this DVD has much lower production values than any of the others. Unlike their usually high quality products, the subject matter here is inaccurately advertised and poorly portrayed. The viewer who has no prior knowledge of Turkish Belly dance will think that all that is necessary to perform Turkish style is a big skirt when, in actuality, skirt dancing is not from Turkey at all.   I have been studying different styles of Belly dance with a heavy emphasis on Turkish Cabaret and Rromani dance for 20 years and teaching Turkish Cabaret and Rromani for the last 11 years and I found that Sarah's research is extremely poor and misleading. Her execution is so unlike any Turkish Belly dance I have ever experienced that I would never recommend this product to anyone. The only good thing I could find about this DVD is the controversy it has generated, because if you're talking Turkey I'm listening.  Eloise Miller AKA Shibar www.mozuna.com 
 I don't recommend this book.  If you remember Kordichs informercials, you know all about the "Juiceman's" claims that juicing solves basically every health problem under the sun,and how eating 'dead'foods like meat is awful.  A bunch of bunk!  Juiceman ... this greasy burger is for you 
 Very complicated book. Bad examples and format. AN FYI for college students trying to save money, the older edition is the SAME as the newest one. What a rip off. 
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep 
 I understand the low budget...stuff like that happens, but the voices didnt match. The mothers voice didnt seem real at all. It sounded like it was from a child. No way would an older woman's voice sounds like that. I like it how Devon's character has to understand his new and emerging feelings, and realize that he's not the only one that feels that way. It's nice to know that his soon to be ex-girlfriend is the understanding type. She's even involved in the end when it comes to uncovering the truth about Devon's step-dad. That's a true friend.  I felt so bad seeing Brian in such a bad shape when Devon rescued him after he was beaten up. I was gonna cry. He said that he was raped and that's just one topic that always gets me. My heart just goes out to the victim. I'm glad that earlier in the movie he becomes willing to share his feelings more with Devon, and actually calls him back after they get into their first fight. Brian cried once he hung up the phone and that always shows a more sensitive part of the man and that's such a turn on for me.  Good movie...I've seen better when it comes to acting, but it was still good. I'm glad that I bought it, but would've liked to have seen more of the Devon and Brian relationship. Oh well. Good job.

 I was very disappointed to find that the version of Penthouse and Pavement on this collection is the 4:04 edited single version with a horrible edit of the intro.  The original version is something like 6:00, so there's nearly two minutes missing from the song.  Otherwise, most of the must-have Heaven 17 songs are here, but all the shortest versions 
 The World According to Waskow should be the title of the totally nonsensical, wretched collection of claptrap. Arthur "East River" Waskow should hold the title of "rabbit" and not "rabbi" because all he has done here is taken his personal political and pseudo-social agenda and coated it with a think shellac of Judaism. I took this book out of the library. I returned it. You should do the same 
 There is no doubting the credentials of the author of this work; a bona fide mystical saint but the way this book is written in a very difficult to understand translation into English (on purpose!)suggests to me that this is more for the scholar or academician than for the lay believer.    There are footnotes that are longer than the main texts on many pages!  This makes for difficult reading and in sticking religiously (sorry)to authenticity, reading for the average Joe is excruciatingly painful.  Perhaps this is part of the purgation one has to tolerate to achieve purity or at least gives us some idea of how difficult it is to be so pure.    Thank goodness for Jesus who shows now why He had to come and save us and to bring us to the Father because the average Joe who I'm sure God wants saved as well would struggle to understand the text as written here.  Don't despair, maybe someone like a Scott Hahn with his brilliant gift of simplifying the vastly difficult scholarly texts will one day try his hand at interpreting this for us.    Reading through this, one can't help but feel brow beaten by someone eager to show how much more scholarly he is to us.  I'm sure that was not St. John's intention so let's hope his message is eventually simplified for mass digestion instead of the indigestion this version promotes.  
 We have this phone at my office and it's junk. Reception is awful. I think you could hear better with two Campbell's soup cans and a string. Have a nice day.  
 Was truly impressed by the quality of the pictures.  Was less impresed by the software in the printer to manage pictures and print - a bit confusing and slow.  The ultimate disappointment was seeing how at times the paper gets jammed, which makes you lose precious ink and paper...  Altogether I don't think I would recommend it.. 
 I picked up this book since it was in the 25 best american novels ever written according to the New-York Times.  Initially, I was interested since the story unfolds in Africa and I knew little about that continent, however, Norman Rush's prose feels really heavy, and, in the end, it wears you out.  I don't recommend this book, instead, pick up A fine balance by Rohinton Mistry. Much better story unfolding in another country 
 In my opinion, this is probably most suited for the most severe cases, but the book is short and cheap 
 Mr Wheaton should take a look at other perils such as the Soviet-like indoctrination of young children into religious faith in this country.  Kids go to college, having been bombarded with Jesus and Christianity since they could remember.  Mr Wheaton seems to think that now if students could only get through Biology class without understanding or embracing the scientific principle that is evolutionary theory,  these students could then help in the effort to put the content free notion of "intelligent design" in our class rooms.  He is prepared, however poorly, to challenge scientific naturalism,.........and pretty much all of science.  Just saying "god did it" would make for a short Biology semester, although, Mr Wheaton would approve.    I am here to say that ignorance is not bliss, and Mr Wheaton has offered no serious rationale to challenge scientific naturalism......because there is none, and  it represents our best methodology for finding truth in the world around us.  Mr Wheaton wants young people to grow up and read their bibles without the use of serious intellectual inquiry, or any kind of critical analysis.  Young people  ignoring the overwhelming evidence that supports evolutionary theory, and the embracing of ideas like the Genesis flood or the life of the Christ figure, neither of which is supported by ANY serious archeological, scientific, or historical evidence of any kind, appears to be his goal. It is after all, why they call it faith.  We should all be quite grateful to science, for it has loosened the stranglehold that religion has held upon mankind for centuries, and it has long ago replaced religion when explanations are required for natural phenomena.     As Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson (two of the great founding fathers of this country)have attested, it is religious doctrine that enslaves the mind of man. Reason and rational thought should be our guides to find truth in life, not belief in unseen supernaturals like gods, goblins, santas, elves, and ogres.  This book will find great acclaim with those people who rely on something other than critical thought.  I am not a supporter of burning books, however, if I were, this would be one of the first that  I would set the match to 
 This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts.  Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought.  Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel 
 I seriously didn't like it. It is definetly not for the young and weak hearted. The characters were not likeable and the fact that everything was sexual was not exactly a positive feature. It sickened me, and i really felt bad after finishing it. Truly skip this book, it's not worthwhile, please i beg of you don't read it. I'm incredibly disappointed in Richard Peck in this one 
 Save your money.  I gave up halfway through and shredded the DVD.  Amanda Peet was great in "Saving Silverman", but she should be mortified by this movie.  "Whipped" was probably written by two fifteen-year-olds on their junior high lunch break.  Absolutely abysmal 
 "A Man for All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts" was not my style.  I adore plays, and this era in time, but this play disappointed me, and I'm disappointed that I didn't enjoy it, as I had high hopes.  I looked at the play, as if I were to perform in it, and it did not strike my fancy.  With practically no stage direction, and little direction of emotion, I thought to myself how I would hate to perform it.  I do give credit for it being such a short play, when this time in history was anything but short and sweet.  I do not recommend 
 I used to have respect for Bill Maher. He used to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to argue my own opinions without making apologies; but not anymore. My respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding hatred for GWB and religion.   I watched "I'm Swiss" once and almost couldn't refrain from vomiting.   He talks about the usual suspects: the president, religion, obesity, same-sex marriage, Rap, and few other things that "comedians" are good at joking about and liberals are good at preaching about. I know, I know, he's not a liberal, he's a libertarian. Well, I have watched and listened to Bill Maher and I know which side he's on most of the time, and it sure isn't on the right. He hates organized religion and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the time. I don't know why his panties are in such a bunch. Being organized is better than being disorganized (I can tell jokes too). I'm not religious; and I can't help but see much of it as hard to swallow, but I'm not arrogant enough to call all of it just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with neurological disorders. I wasn't there when the Bible was written or when the events took place. I can't say it's all fairtyales. I can only say some of it isn't logical. But, I respect religion and its purposes; which is what separates me from him.   He has no qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an afterlife or religion, which are both things that make life more bearable for them. The purpose of religion is to provide hope and solace and relief to people who are living in desperation. The same purpose of drugs I might add: something Maher not only defends but abuses. Why the double standard?  This is no longer the eleventh century where Protestants are killing Catholics. The only people k/illing in the name of religion are fanatical Muslims, but most religious people are good, decent, nonviolent individuals. Maher's not an atheist, but he has recently expressed a "could be, could be not" attitude toward the existence of a G/od, which would make him agnostic. But one thing is for sure, atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does. Two of our biggest mass murderers--Hitler and Stalin--were atheist.   It's a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than Maher, who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one. Most of the time, he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself. I laughed twice during the entire show.   No one has ever accused Maher of being modest. He's a smug, intellectual elitist. And those are his GOOD qualities. "I'm Swiss" displays this all too clearly. In case you didn't know, "I'm Swiss" is a running joke of Maher's embarrassment of being an American. He'd rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for, not an extension of, morality; where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all; where adultery is seen as cute, not sinful; where there are no fat people; where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions.  Thank God I live in America and not Switzerland. 
 Although the movie is really good fun to watch, and has some good songs and music on it, the soundtrack is really uninteresting.  It seems although the most boring music and songs have been chosen to put this CD together 
 Here are Barrett's major points, (with my comments):1/the USDA Food Guide Pyramid is all you need. (Really, then why has the pyramid been changed so many times? Have our needs as a species changed?) 2/ Following the US Dietary Guidelines will prevent all deficiencies.(By it's -own- standards, yes. Should one organization decide both the requirements -and- judge the results? The only thing that could possibly make them wrong would be for them to admit it. Not likely. It's a self-monitoring agency..not a good thing. 3/All vitamin companies are liars. (Some are, some aren't, just like any group. You're a psychiatrist, how honest did  Freud  turn out to be?) 4/Stress causes the symptoms that are attributed to poor diet. (A psychiatrist would think that, of course. Aside from that, says who?  A 25-year-long suppressed government paper states that nutritional deficencies are the #1 cause of health problems. ) 5/Milled out B vitamins are put back with enrichment.(Sounds like adding VITAMINS to me, I thought you were against that. And how do you replace nutrients that science hasn't discovered yet?) 6/Only a few vitamins are sensitive to heat.(Only a few? I guess too few to matter?)7/Minerals are not destroyed by cooking. (Correct, but they are -altered-, and that can't be a good thing, assuming they were in the correct form in the first place.) 8/Additives aren't proven to cause problems.(Very close to proven, Doc. I don't want to die to prove it. The agencies in charge of safety don't have the time,resources, inclination, or even the legal right to check -every- ingredient thoroughly, and the synergy of combined ingredients isn't even something they -attempt- to test. The -government- must prove an ingredient is -unsafe-; it's -not- the duty of the manufacturer to prove that it -is- safe. Is -that- really safe?) 9/Fluoride is good. (There is so much detailed evidence against fluoride that I accuse any proponent of collusion with the industry.) 10/Small doses of pesticides are no problem. (How small, and who's measuring? Even if this is possibly true for the few poisons that break down quickly, it is absolutely untrue for poisons that remain intact and accumulate over one's lifetime; small now is big later.  This has been  proven to be an especially -deadly- lie when synergy of poisons sometimes increase their toxicity a -thousand- times over). There's plenty more,  of course. I believe Barrett knows where his bread is buttered. Corporate criminals need confederates in medicine to make the machine work...Doesn't psychiatry have a bad enough reputation already? This book would be  joke if it weren't so dangerous./// For a truer look at the modern world's effect on our health, read _The Hundred Year Lie_, by Randall Fitzgerald. The author is not an advocate of the  typical health food products, (which are often  just as filled with unlabeled additives as the 'foods' Barrett defends), but convincingly, debunks  Barrett's claims for the safety of government approved additives to , and manipulations of our food supply.///    
 As an arcaheology student studying vernacular architecture, I found this particular text to be a waste of time. It does nothing for the history of architecture, nor does it lend itself to coherent reading 
 I only had it for a few hours and after that I knew I would be returning it. Its video quality is quite horrible, just better than a videophone and average of a webcam. I should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive. But honestly, I prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is. It's quality will not be any better unless your outside, and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun, this would not do. You basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow. This also is a pain for Mac users. It says it's able to import files, and yes it can, but in ASF format. Now you can play it in VLC, but think you'll be able to convert it, think again. It converts just fine, except without audio. I've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio. So, Mac users, pick something else. It is being returned, for certain 
 Dont get me wrong, Im generally big on Eco, not only his novels, but also the other essay books and Travels in Hyperreality really was an eye opener in my intellectual development. But Kant and the Platypus was a real disappointment. First, the reference to Kant is rather misleading, for Kant's work is reviewed rather summerally and reduced to an absurdity. Kant's categories of cognition are not geared towards semiotics as such, but towards formal logical operations, the space time structure of thinking. To say that the Kantian categories fall short of an analysis of meaning is to suggest that the faucet was deficient in putting out the fire at Macy's. Second, to say the perceptual categories of every day meaning are negotiated contracts with a community of parlants, does not require almost 400 pages. The essays are like pastries oversaturated with sacharine. After the initial taste or two, u just feel like putting it down.  It was a labor to honor the man by finishing the book. 
 I was disappointed with this novel.  It introduces several characters and plots, but never really develops any of them.  It was like traveling down a winding road and then the road just ends with no signs or warnings 
 Lang Lang who? He does not have the poetry of a Cortot; he isn't as technically gifted as a Horowitz or a Barere; he does not have the structural playing of an Arrau, nor the deep sonority of a Rubinstein.   What frustrates me the most is that he tries to copy Horowitz. I was at Symphony Hall last year listening to him play Mozart, Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Schumann and Liszt, and his last piece was the Horowitz arrangement of Liszt's Second Rhapsody. Who the hell does he think he is? He lacked the power, the articulation and clarity, and the magic. When Horowitz played Carmen everybody went home astonished as if they had run into a force of nature. I went home full of question marks.   He plays fast. Really fast. And yet his Rachmaninoff is unethical, his Chopin Sonata stale and lackluster, his Liszt so embellished it becomes patchy and lopsided. I fell asleep when he played Kinderszenen.   Lang Lang's concerts are like circus acts - what has happened to the purity of music-making? Is it really possible to walk on the stage with flashing lights like some rockstar would, and then launch into a Mozart Sonata?   If he really turns-out to be the future of classical music, I think it would be time for me to hide in a monastery somewhere in eastern Europe and listen to Cortot recordings for the rest of my life. That day would be a sad day indeed 
 This book is as far from the title as you can get.  It's somewhere between Dr. Phil, an Einstein lecture and a Mensa meeting.  !0% of the writings related directly to the title, the other 90% was as far way as you can get.  That's where you should be from this book. 
 This book disappointed me after reading Martins letters. Although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity. There are much better books on analysing companies I suggest Financial Statement Analysis by Martin Fridson and Fernando Alvarez. 
 Hi, I have never written any reviews and don't plan on making a habit of it, but I know what it is to be truly heartbroken. I want to help you in any way I can because I know what you are going through. I have read every book on the subject that is out there, believe me. If you are really hurting, this book is not for you. It does not give you practical advice to help you get through the hurt. It's goal is to make you laugh and even at that, when you are hurting so badly, that is hard to do. I recommend two books for you: "You Didn't Complete Me" and "It's Called a Break-up because it's Broken." These were much more helpful to me. 
 This Joe d'Amato film takes the Women in Prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze, bordering on pornography. The plot, or lack thereof, is typical: woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards  corruption. To make the film last 80 minutes, Joe d'Amato fills the story  with lesbianism, vile tortures, naked women in rat infested sewers, and  plenty of gratuitous sex. I gave this movie 1 star because there is no  option for a 0 star rating. Even hardcore fans of Euro sex queen Laura  Gemser will find this one a total bore 
 On our recent road trip, my girlfriend and I brought along some audio books to help us stay awake. Both were historical fiction set in ancient Greece. Sappho's Leap was read by the author, and her mangled pronunciations and over-dramatic tone may have influenced my reaction, but I don't think so.  Unlike Thermopylae, the subject of Gates of Fire (review coming soon), virtually nothing about Sappho is known, Ms. Jong was free to make up just about any story she liked. And she did. Sappho's Leap is a sappy love story with a long interlude where Jong basically plagiarizes Homer, only watering him down to speed the plot. Further, and to make matters worse, Sappho's Leap is not very well-written. It is melodramatic, banal, and overly adjectival. It reads like syrup. Jong apparently can't think of a word for vagina other than "delta" and nothing for penis other than "phallus," which words are like comedy catchphrases by the end of the novel.  The book starts out well. Sappho has climbed a cliff, but pauses to reflect on the story of her life (in media res, like every Greek story). She starts at the beginning, relating how she runs away from hom with Alceous, a famous Lesbian singer. They are exiled from Lesbos for trying to overthrow its tyrant, and her adventures begin. She is married off to a paunchy lush who lives in Syracuse, although pregnant with Alceous's child, to be named Cleis (mispronounced by Jong). When her husband dies, the adventure begins in earnest. After a stay in Egypt, Sappho takes off with the fabulist, Aesop, for Delphi, but is frequently sidetracked along the way. Jong sends Sappho to the Amazons on Crete (?!?) where she causes the return of Pegasus, the island of the centaurs, the underworld, Medusa's sister, etc. In an age where the Greeks occupied the majority of the Mediterranean, Sappho manages to elude everyone for a space of ten years or more, which occupy maybe four chapters of the book.  These adventures are trite, simplified copies of the Odyssey, and add almost nothing to the plot. Nothing really improves from there. Once Sappho returns to the land of the real, Jong wraps things up quickly and predictably. The novel ends with a syrupy, happy ending. Sappho and all her lovers and friends end up living on another random island with her friends, until her daughter sails up with her grandchildren. Ugh.  And don't get me started on the "poems" at the end.  This was my first Erica Jong book, and I think it will be my last. It gets two stars only because I need a lower rung for truly pulp romance, which this book just barely isn't 
 I don't like this book.  In fact I'm going to return it.  It doesn't explain things well.  I recommend Princeton Review stuff.  But be careful whatever you get.  Ask around.  Its the only way 
 Joel Coen and Ethan Coen's "Fargo" is a dull and listless film.  A glance at the Coens' filmography reveals that they have produced some amusing fare in their careers.  Too bad this outing is a misfire.     A Minnesota car salesman named Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) conspires with Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap and ransom his wife.  Jerry has hatched this plan to help ease his financial troubles and believes his father-in-law will be more than willing to come up and with the money to spring his daughter.  However, the plan quickly unravels and the conspirators' missteps attract the unwanted attention of the local police chief, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).   McDormand and Macy turn in wonderful performances as the two central characters.  Yet, both of them find themselves stuck in a story that is of minimal interest to the viewer.  The absurd situations and skewed humor that characterize "Fargo" are only good for a chuckle here and there.  In fact, the desolate snowy landscape is the only aspect of the film that leaves a lasting impression.  The scenery so overwhelms the story that you find yourself passing the time by contemplating the awesome power of nature instead of paying attention to the proceedings.  The bottom line is that the Coens have done better work.  You time would be better spent watching "Blood Simple" (1984) or "Miller's Crossing" (1990) instead.            
 While there were some interesting bits in this book and it was readable, for the most part it completely undermined the character of Raistlin, contradicts previous books, and is generally annoying 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 This book was horrible I couldn't get into it all. I loved Black and ugly but Hustler's son was not as well written 
 ...to dieting and to writing. As a previous reviewer alluded to, this book would have been much better had Dr. Atkins been able to finish himself. However, what we are left with is a co-author MD who's personality is as cold as ice; not to mention condescending and disrespectful.  This shines through in the tone of the writing. Furthermore, how can we take diet advice from someone who is obese herself? There are plenty of other well-written low-carb diet books.  Try another 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf.  I had to return it 
 After the brilliant "Going After Cacciato," this book severely disappointed me.  The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue hollow and unbelievable, and the plot laughable.  I had a hard time swallowing just about every scene.  I didn't like Tom, and not because he was obnoxious, but because he was such a broad stereotype with no depth.  R. Russo created an equally obnoxious protagonist (also a professor) in "Straight Man" who did some pretty loony things, yet I loved that book.  It rang true.  This book does not.  By the end, I did not cheer, I did not hiss.  I found I just didn't care one way or another for any of the characters 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 The Collector's Edition Soundtrack leaves out two great Rolling Stones' tunes She Smiled Sweetly & Ruby Tuesday. Also left to the winds is John Lennon's Look at Me, the Clash's Rock the Kazbah. The First Edition leaves a few tunes off too but it is a far better Soundtrack. Puckstar 
 The gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un-fun!  The kids didn't even like it. Run, don't walk away from this dentist-office of a game JAWS-cr@p. (JAWS = Just another W. Smith 
 This is a prescriptive work aimed at helping church leaders focus on the right things.  As with any prescriptive work, how helpful the book is depends on where YOU are coming from.  If you are coming from the same place as the author (white suburban/rural America) then I think this is a helpful book with important insights!  If you come from an Urban area or a very multiethnic/multicultural city, then you should probably read critically, and with extra care.  The author's use of the word "culture" is broad and, in some senses, a bit uninformed.  The chapters are a series of topical sermons (even the chapter on the importance of expositional sermons!).  This is a format I don't particularly care for (unless the author is someone like D.M. Lloyd-Jones).    Toward the end of the book it becomes clear that what the author is advocating is not so much the antithesis to church growth theology, but more of a wholistic model for church growth (ala Orlando Costas) 
 considering the talents of Both Eddie Levert&Gerald Levert this set is very middle of the road.the vocals are good but the music is for the most part run of the mill 
 The idea of being able to spy on people, and history, via wormholes is an interesting idea. Seeing how people would deal with such an extreme loss of privacy is dealt with somewhat well.  As a whole, however, the book is little more than an interesting idea. The problem is the human element. The authors paid more attention to the way that the technology in the story is portrayed than the characters. As a result, none of the characters really pop out at you or seem very textured.  Also, with the various wormhole excursions into the past, I agree with an earlier reviewer that the authors would've been better off showing us these excursions rather than telling us about them. Those scenes come off with all the charm of a lab report.  If this book were a movie, I would say wait till it's broadcast on network television 
 I love MCR as well and I am just dying for something new from them and purchased this item. I thought it would have other interviews that did not make it on Life On the Murder Scene but all it had were interviews by people from Eyeball and radio disc jockeys. Yes the same pictures of the band were shown over and over while these people discussed there over exaggerated experiences with the band 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 This book is short on practical "how to" advice on breastfeeding, and long on preachy passages that attempt to convenince all moms to stay at home and breastfeed until your child is 8.  I'm a working mom of 3 and have extensive experience with breastfeeding.  There are about 3-4 pages of this book that actually inform, and the rest is an attempt to pursuade mothers to stay at home and breastfeed the rest of their lives.  
 I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed, but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller.  I really don't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of "firm control".  Sure, it's comfortable, but I was expecting some kind of control.  It does smooth out some, but not at all what I was expecting.. 
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 The FM tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations.  The radio part, hence, was worthless.  The speakers are sub standard, no depth.  Without the remote, little can be done.  All in all, it is not worth trying.  My cheap 20 year old Sony boombox is of much higher quality 
 I really liked this unit (and its transmitter unit twin), but only for as long as it actually worked. It works well sending signal from my TiVo in the living room to my office, where I have a TV monitor and the audio running through a decent sound system on the computer. I really like the capability to use the TiVo remote from the office. However, after a few months, both of the transmitter units I've bought have died. (I've bought full pairs both times.) I can still get audio, but the video feed is gone. I'm to the point now where I'm looking for alternatives. 
 This book is lame.  It's black and white drawings are sloppy and they don't instruct.   There is little or no instructions This book is way over priced.  Stay away from it 
 I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters. 
 Relative to "War all the Time" and "Full Collapse", "A City by the Light Divided" is a huge disappointment.  Maybe it's in the production or maybe the songs are simply not as well written, but the entire release lacks the melody and hooks that are prevalent in the earlier material.  The Other Side of the Crash is clearly an attempt to build on Understanding in a Car Crash, but without the urgency and punch.  There are a few decent cuts, such as Running from the Rain, but mostly the band sounds uninspired 
 I received the DVD and it skips, I was very dissatisfied.  I would have returned it , but since I have never had a problem before, I had thrown the receipt away.  Patrice Trace 
 I ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the UHF channels. I live in a big city and I thought I shouldn't have a problem with any indoor antenna. it seems I was mistaken. this antenna is useless. it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna 
 After reading the first 56 pages of this book, I'm done. It has  extremely little to do with Bicycling, rather it's more about an aimless man who is having sex with multiple women and the book is mostly about how he cycles through them. I think that's why the title "cycling"  If youre looking for a book about cycling try The Race. It's worth reading again and agai 
 This commercial outline is terrible as an introduction to federal income tax.  It takes FOREVER to find basic definitions, such as the distinction between ordinary income and capital assets.  Without an understanding of these definitions, you won't understand anything in the book, yet the author fails to make the definitions clear.    For example, I first went to the capsule summary to find the definition of "capital asset" and then found that I had to turn to another section of the book.  When I turned to that page, I found that I had to turn a couple more pages to find only PART of the definition of "capital asset" and then I had to turn to yet another section of the book, no pages provided by the author this time, to get the rest of the definition.  To make a long story short, the organization of this book makes no sense at all.  If you already understand federal income tax, this commercial outline might be useful as a review.  Otherwise, if you're taking tax only because you feel obligated by the requirements of your bar exam, then perhaps another commerical outline is better 
 Although there are singing birds on this CD, the music overshadows them.  The music is lovely and relaxing, but if what you want is the sounds of  birds, this CD is not for you 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 The reference to craft "superstars" should have warned me off. The lowly T-shirt shows up as a placemat, a lampshade, a car-lot hanging banner, cafï¿½ curtains, and a rug - oh yeah, and a couple of overworked wearables, too. Tricky projects show off the wit of their too-cool creators rather than enrich the lives of DIY readers.Who needs it? 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 steer clear.  This movie suffers from terminal SCS... Shaky Camera Syndrome, the latest thing nowadays to make a movie look cool.  Not only does that leave you disturbed physically, but it distracts you from what could be crucial elements of the story, such as Giovanni Ribisi's family history, which they also manage to screw up, leaving you really not caring if he wins or loses in the end.  Pile on top of that the awful acting and the extremely poor casting choices of Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel, and you have a waste of time.  As for Giovanni Ribisi, he's ok in this movie, but go buy/rent Heaven with him and Cate Blanchett 
 I read this book after watching the brilliant movie version of "The Hours."  If that's your motivation, don't waste your time.  My English teachers will cringe when I say it, but this book, well, sucks. It may well be great literature, but the characters are not engaging, and if it was Woolf's motive to out-do James Joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative, she doesn't pull it off.  Again, the characters and the internal mental life simply don't have the power that "Ulysses" has.  Reading Woolf is necessary for a good eduction.  I recommend, however, that you read "To the Lighthouse". I may still be motivated to read the book version of "The Hours" given how great the movie was.  But my taste for Woolf is all done now.   
 Something most writers never learn--brevity.  This author never learned how to be concise either.  I tried to read it, I really did! I was very excited about the book, thought I'd love it.  I couldn't get past the pages and pages of over the top imagery and the descriptions.  She was trying to create word pictures of what Heaven is like, and went way overboard.  (I made it through the Left Behind books, and they are really badly written and I don't agree with all of their premises either.  That says a lot about the way this was written.) I didn't get far enough to have much to say about the theology of the book--but the idea of Michael, Gabriel and Satan being brothers, I just didn't like.  I think you need to be very solid in your faith before reading this, don't actually think this is real.  Satan is real, God is real, angels are real, but it is a work of fiction.  And a badly written one at that.  I'd give it fewer stars, but I am encouraged that someone is trying to tackle the idea of the Heavens and the spiritual realm 
 I was very disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD until the quality is back to that of a professional recording 
 I mostly listen to two kinds of music - country and jazz.  Guess what - they don't cross over.  I will never play this album again 
 I agree wholeheartedly with Kenneth Ryan's review.  This book was "recommended" reading in one of my English classes at UCLA several years ago, and I bought it, but just now picked it up for a read.  The problem is that the main character is so vapid that I simply did not CARE what happened to her.  It has always been my firm belief that one must identify with, care about, or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading.  This novel was painful to finish; who cares what happens to these people?  I agree that whatever "splash" the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters.  It's hard to shock us these days, and the book is now just plain uninteresting 
 I used to love Tool.  "Aenema" was an amazing album.  "Lateralus" was decent, but not quite as good.  "10,000 Days" might as well be called "Lateralus, Pt. 2."  It sounds just the same and as if these were the songs that didn't make it onto "Lateralus."  Personally, I'm getting tired of Maynard's bulls**t, politically-driven songwriting.  Hey Maynard, we all know you went to the prep school for Westpoint - you can stop wearing that piece of your history on your sleeve.  If you were really smart enough, you would have graduated.  As a graduate of Westpoint, I can tell you that getting into the prep school is not that hard; actually graduating is.  Tool needs to get back to basics that made them who they are.  Their ability to make another great album has not passed, but it has just taken a detrimental detour with "10,000 Days. 
 More an attempt to cash in on Rice's genre with far less enjoyment than that which was provided by the graphic novels and movies. Unless you like reading the encyclopedia or the dictionary, there's really no reason to purchase this book. Fans of Ms. Rice already know these facts 
 This is without question one of the worst movies I have even seen.  I know---you're saying: "Aw, where's your sense of fun? It's a comedy. You know, it's a parody of spy movies."  Wrong. "Our Man Flint" was a parody of spy movies. "In Like Flint" is a parody of itself---a mindless, talentless puffball of a movie floating along on its predecessor's slipstream.  The producers must've been so high on the first movie's success, they thought they could do no wrong. Or maybe they just flew off on vacation and left everyone to do whatever they wanted. Watching this mess, it's entirely possible.  A ludicrous, unfunny plot (women try to take over the world, then the men who were helping them decide they want to take it over instead, completely invalidating the first premise, zzzzzzzzzzzz...); positively awful dialogue; home-movie-style cinematography (not one creative shot in the whole picture); squirmingly clowny fight sequences; high-school film-class lighting; sets positively cluttered with wooden non-actors; a maddeningly lilting, cloying score that defies anything happening onscreen...  And through the whole thing, there's James Coburn strutting around giving us his "It doesn't matter how bad this movie is, I'm so cool" smirk, like a smarmy lounge singer on the Titanic.  A parody needs some semblance of intelligence, of imagination, of planning, of technical proficiency. Oh, and of humor. This has none of that.   Proclaiming a movie a parody isn't an excuse for plain bad filmmaking. This is just a bad, bad, movie. Bad 
 This book was not what I wanted.  I was looking for a practical guide that gave examples of questions typically asked in a law enforcement interview and examples of good answers to those questions.  This book is more of a workbook that makes the reader develop his own ideas for typical interview questions and answers.  I could have done that on my own without paying over $30.    The book is also poorly written, which made me question the qualifications of the author.  The author apparently has a Ph.D., but he has not mastered the use of punctuation.  Here are a couple of examples from the book.  On page 36, he writes, "Strategies that do not produce a desirable image of you, as being genuine, or showing you as being comfortable with what you are saying; will in the end come across as artificial and scheming."  On the following page, he writes, "Why?  Because: people with specialized training should not, be given any advantage over people, without such training."  Because there were similar errors throughout the book, it was hard for me to take his advice seriously. 
 A MOUSE LOOSES HIS FAMILY MEMBERS & THEN FINDS THEM.  IT'S JUST AN OK BOOK, VERY UNDERSERVING OF ALL THE 5-STAR REVIEWS.  A BETTER MOUSE BOOK WOULD BE- IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE. 
 This has all of the features of the headset that came with my phone, and it was much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from T-mobile.  Brand new, and I had to jiggle the cable near the plug to get it to work. In order to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart, which could have broken the wires if I weren't careful, and may tear further through wearing it.   The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces; this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple.   There are several places which I'm worried will break soon through normal wear and tear. The ear pieces are hard plastic, and look like they'll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time. The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music. Also be warned that shipping was listed as $5 for a $7 item, when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 2-3 stamps.  The cable is barely 3 feet long from mike to plug, so I don't recommend it for tall people.  It will do until I can find better, but that's the best I can sa

 My mom left this book at my house. So I thought..."Hey, free book." If you read quickly and frequently you should go ahead and give this a try. If you are a slow reader. . .spend your time on something with more substance. After a fairly long drawn-out story with little humor and not much suspense I was surprised to find the final chapters to be reasonably satisfying.   Hence the two stars. But I assure you there is zero "kung-fu" in this one 
 Buy the other, the All The Pretty Horses alone, with reader Muller (sp?) Frank. Brad Pitt does a very poor job, and I was amazed how poor. He hardly seems like a trained actor. He badly mispronounces Spanish (pronounces 'jefe' as 'jeffy')and his reading is like something a grade-school child would produce. He carries the question tone over to the 'he said' in interrogative sentences and does not change voice tone from one speaker to another. He sounds like a slacker who has been forced to read a high-school composition. This guy is an actor?    And the abridgement ruins the stories in all three novels.  Now I have to go back and buy the other because I love ATPH very much and want to hear it read by someone who has had voice training and a good voice 
 I composed a review for this film several days ago. Why it hasn't been posted remains a mystery.  Oh yes, WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. Based on several stories by deceased writer Andre Dubus, the film follows the lives of two married couples: Hank and Edith (Peter Krause and Naomi Watts), and Jack and Terry (Mark Ruffalo and Laura Dern). His marriage growing increasingly miserable by the day, Jack starts sleeping with Edith (in the woods, no less). Terry and Hank are hardly people to feel sorry for; Jack catches the two going at it in a car. Between the woods and cars parked outside, I wonder what's wrong with using a hotel room...?  One would assume a cast that includes Emmy-nominated Krause and Golden-Globe winning Dern, the acting would be flawless. Not the case. While the amazon.com reviewer singled out the performances from Dern and Ruffalo, the only one really making an effort was Naomi Watts. Her performance wasn't anything special, but I'll take that over Dern's stagy, stilted delivery or Ruffalo's laconic and dull attempt at acting. As for Krause... eh. He didn't embarass himself but he's accomplished so much more on TV's "Six Feet Under". Why the poor acting? I don't know, but it's not the screenwriter's fault. Full of intelligent dialogue, dry humor, and literary references, it comes as no surprise that the script ended up winning an award at Sundance. My only quibble is the random voiceovers from Hank. Either most of the film should have narration, or none at all. Three sections of narration just feels awkward and half-hearted.  The direction, courtesy of Australian auteur John Curran, is adequate. The only memorable moment is when Hank saves his kids (or almost kills them, depending on whom you ask) from falling into a river. Nicely shot, Curran. The score, courtesy of composer Michael Convertino, is also of note. Its solemn, almost melancholy nature makes it a perfect choice for the film. I'd go so far as to say it's the movie's high point.  If you're wondering whether to rent this movie or not, go for it. Just don't let your expectations get too high. I can't recommend the stories WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE and ADULTERY. I found them to be tedious and irritating (then again, it's not like this movie was a prize) 
 Not as helpful as I had hoped.  Equivalent information is widely available on the internet 
 I was SO excited about getting this in the mail to start reading, I had just read "This Wheels on Fire" by Levon Helm (which is AMAZING) and wanted to read more about that kind of music and read a critics take on it all and well...it was awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was pretentious and cliche...all of it. I cannot understand why this book is supposed to be so great. He makes all of these assumptions about what these musicians bodies of work are really about or are supposed to represent but even to someone who was not alive during the time period, it is obvious B.S.! Marcus tries to explain that The Band's whole body of work is some sort of metaphor...that is about a "worried man"...that their work is a story that they have made up to represent their fears and their vices. If you want to know what "the weight" is about, read Levon Helm's book which is honest, touching, inspiring AND informative 
 I have been practicing yoga for several years and was looking for a way to introduce it to my partner. I found this book to be poorly laid out and I did not feel it had a cohesive theme. The poses were awkward, did not have the insight I was looking for 
 I had to put this book down several times before being able to slog through it.  Expositional and boring dialogue, ho-hum plot, and unlikeable characters. When Bourne's wife has the stupidity to follow him to Paris to "save" him only to admonish him for being a stone cold killer in front of his colleagues, it becomes laughable.  Couple that with the fact Bourne has to do everything for the bimbo, including grabbing her purse from the gunshot scene at the hotel and you almost wish she'd been offed. How is this tripe possible from the man who wrote The Aquitane Progression?  It truly seems like another writer.  This book is completely unworthy of it's predecessor, The Bourne Identity 
 The "ology" series started out as very fun and unique publications. This particular book and model set has little to offer comparatively.  Rather disappointing.. 
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 After reading A Fine Balance I couldn't wait to read another book by this author. I then read his third book called Family Matters which was good but I was disappointed as it by no means compared to A Fine Balance. I just finished Such A Long Journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots.  It is my least favorite of the three books by this author. It's hard to believe that someone can right a book like A Fine Balance, which was magnificant and one of the best books I have ever read, and then turn our stuff that is, at best, average.    
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 It is true that the authoress quotes much from some primary sources, however the book is basically an expression of her political/social opinions and is not a history.  Her liberal biases, ardent feminism, lack of respect for Christian values, and her very limited understand of Southern culture and history, are overwhelmingly expressed.  If you are an historian who was taught to evaluate primary sources without your personal biases, and if you are interested in a true history that reflects these values, you'll be sadly disappointed with this book 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 It was sooo Long and boring, and for the first 10-20 pages you had not a clue what was happening 
 Loud, obnoxious and generally unfunny live-action adaption of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon.   After watching this film I realized that the legendary 80's mega-flop "Howard the Duck" was almost twenty years ahead of its time. There's very little difference between Scooby-Doo (and most of the other current films of this type) and that classic bomb! Perhaps the only difference is that today this garbage is actually successful and is even considered "sequel worthy". Also, Just to be fair to Howard the Duck, at least that movie had the visual appeal of Lea Thompson.  If your idea of fun is bombastic, poorly produced special effects, a crappy modern soundtrack and a plethora of booger and fart jokes then this is the film for you! Certainly worth checking out if you're a fan of the Scooby-Doo character, but just be prepared to end up wanting two hours of your life back!  The sequel deserves the exact same review.  -J 
 Maybe I am even less talented than I thought, maybe I am just downright stupid, maybe problem is in my expectations, as I expected something more visual and less technical.. but this book is not a beginner's book. I bought a telescope for my son this xmas, and I wanted to know what the heck we are looking at once skies clear over Croatia. This book will not serve that purpose. IF I WERE an astronomy / physics anthusiast (NEVER!), THEN this book would have been a beginner's book 
 After hearing so much about the book, I must admit to a disappointment in its contents.  As a Belgian that has immigrated to the USA, I am well familiar with the many contrasts between Europe and the US and found Mr. Reid's observations to be lacking both in perspective and completeness.  For example, Mr Reid appears enamored with the European welfare state, vaunts its many virtues and describes it as a central pillar of the new "European identity" that is superior to the barbarous American model, but admits in small print in its Appendix that the European welfare state faces a crisis that far surpasses the US social security system in magnitude and will not survive in its present form.  I felt that a fair discussion on the topic should have included a discussion on the countless challenges to the welfare state.  I thought that many of his other observations lacked the same kind of roundness.  I felt that the book lack depths and was primarily suitable to a reader in search of a caricature on the relationship between Europe and America. 
 I would have to disagree with the statement that Scary Movie 3 was the best movie ever made.  The movie was a complete mesh of other famous flicks, such as The Ring and Signs.  I wouldn't suggest that people would buy this movie because it's just humor thrown into odd places.  I've seen the movie five times, and although I laugh, it still isn't the greatest movie.  I'm just relieved that there wasn't as much language in this movie than in Scary Movie 2.  My God - they swore every other minute!  Anyway, buy The Ring or Signs if you want to see a really good movie 
 Whoa...my sisters have this set at their house, which I used extensively last night to cut with. In a word? Terrible.   They have not used them much, and all they had for me was a glass cutting board (I know, terrible). Due to the glass cutting board, I knew these edges, had they been used, would not be terribly sharp.  I made a point of sharpening them on the included steel using the procedure outlined in the manual.  Anyhow, I found myself both struggling and TEARING vegetables when cutting them. To slice red pepper, I was having to pull the remaining portion of the pepper up to tear it off of the piece I *thought* I'd just cut.   Perhaps this is a terribly unfair comparison, as I am used to my Henckels Pro "S" set. But for crying out loud, I didn't think it would be THIS bad.  While I cannot speak for the rest of the Henckels "International" (meaning "Made in Spain, not Germany") line, this set was very much unacceptable. You would literally get a better value buying a Henckels 4-Star Chef's Knife instead of this WHOLE SET. At least you'd get some real use out of it.  The steak knives feel cheap. This is definitely a $60-feeling set, no great "value," in my opinion. I would never, ever, ever buy a Henckels International product after this interlude and will happily return home tonight to my Henkels Pro "S" set...where cutting through ANYTHING is like gliding through soft butter 
 The messages in this book cannot be faulted: treat your child with respect and teach self control. The prequel, "Raising Your Spirited Child", teaches parents to first adjust to their child's temperament and is quite good. Much of content is repeated in this book. The disadvantage of this book is that the messages get lost in the overly abundant stories used to humanize and illustrate behavioral points. And all have simple causes and neat conclusions. Reading was slow and not particularly beneficial. For a parenting book that better addresses common problems, common responses and better responses, read "How to Talk to Your Child". However, there's still the need for a book that addresses how to handle situations where time doesn't allow diplomacy or diplomacy doesn't yield results 
 I found this book to be a real disappointment. While the words "all kinds of families" seem to open up a world of possibilities, the pictures tell a different story.  Yes, the families may be black or white, old or young, married or divorced, or even include someone who is in jail.   HOWEVER - the pictures almost always show an adult male and an adult  female.  As a single mother of two children, both of whom came to me  through donor insemmination, I do not feel that this book sends an  inclusive message to families that do not include a father figure 
  The three MD's who authored Sugar Busters have discovered that sugar is bad, but haven't learned about all the other horrendous things that have happened to the American food supply.   Sugar contributes to disease, they say, sugar makes us gain weight and we should avoid it. So far so good. But turning to the meal plan we find a bewildering array of processed and denatured foods: High-glycemic whole grain extruded cereals like Whole Grain Oat Cheerios and Shredded Wheat `N Bran; reduced fat triscuits; lowfat milk products; lite mayonnaise; and MSG-laden Worcestershire sauce, Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce and canned chicken broth.   Reduce saturated fats, they advise, but fail to mention the problems of trans fatty acids.   Diet drinks containing neurotoxic aspartame are fine, according to the writers.   This book is a good example of that old saying: A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.   From Sally Fallon at westonaprice.org. 
 This book reads like bullet statements. There is no fluidity at all and unfortunately terribly repetitive. I just completely lost it when it said...'Christianity is a religion of polytheism, believing in three gods in its teachings of the Trinity.' This is grossly inaccurate. Now I have to question the first half of the book. If this was said in the first 10 pages I would have just deleted the book and saved my time on the rest. I want to get a better understanding of Islam and Muslims so I am more cordial and respectful.  I want to do this without the feeling of being converted if I spoke with a Muslim. After reading this I feel like I might end up offending someone. So I will quit while I am ahead. You should do the same keep your money. 
  I'm a big fan of Shogun (4 1/2 stars) and Tai-Pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here.  But after 450 pages I gave up.  Plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters.  I got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when I was ready for development and resolution of what came before.  This book picks up with the Straun/Brock rivalry from Tai-Pan after an interval of 120 years.  I wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what I read.   The writing is still good and I may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but I had to move on to something more satisfying 
 This Book is not about the making of Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs. At page 115 (!) The Dominoes goes in the studio. Before that you get the story about how pretty Pattie Boyd was (and still is). There are some interesting stories in this book, but none of them are about the making of Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs. Why Does This Book Got To Be So Bad? The answer is: Jan Reid is not focused on the music. 
 What age range is the book appropriate for?  Poor Horton -- They beat him.  They maul him.  And try to cage him.  And threaten to boil the dust speck in Beezle-Nut juice just to teach him a lesson.  My poor 5 year old looked at me with sad eyes, and asked, "why?"  Not the best bed-time story 
 I ordered a PC case that came in a box 1000 times larger then what this was shipped in for 10 dollar shipping but I ordered 5 of these for myself and co workers and shipping was 22 dollars.  Never agai 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 As a rule, I'll give a book 50 pages to get interesting. After that, I'll put it down.  I went to 75 with this book and it still disappointed.   It was excessively laden with detail and not light reading. Other documentaries (notably those by Iris Chang) have given a lot of historical detail and yet still were interesting and easy to read.  I've not suitable alternatives to suggest, but I know that at least one other book has been written that has been as boring as this one. And that's not because I've found that book, but because I know that no other book can be as boring as this one was 
 This collection of essays is enjoyable, but not overall his best writing.  A few of the essays are interesting histories of science, skeptical method, and biography; the rest are dry lists of data that read like endnotes in some unwritten, more interesting book. 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 My mother in-law was actually responsible for Billy Milligan while he was in the Athens State hospital in Ohio.  I've had a chance to read this book, and although very good, what my mother-in-law tells me is much, much different.   She cared for him during his entire stay there.  She said that he had more psychology and parapsychology books in his room than she could have ever imagined.  She also said that his IQ was off the charts.  She believes (and she has a doctorate in psychology) he only has FOUR distinct personalities.  Raven being one of them.  Billy had the abilitiy and knowledge to manipulate his condition, making it appear much more severe.   Of course, she can't write anything about this, because Billy's publicist made everyone caring for him sign a waiver saying they wouldn't.  Yes... Billy Milligan has a publicist.   He also was a millionaire (because he exploited his disease) and drove a corvette on the weekends they let him go home.... yep... they let Billy Milligan have weekends.  This book is a very good interpretaion on what could possibly been going on in Billy's head.  However, after talking with someone who was actually there, and knew him well.... makes me second guess the validity of it 
 An important test of any theory is how much evidence exists for its case.  In this book, Doherty proposes that Christianity began with a celestial Christ who was thought to be crucified in a celestial realm above the earth, and that Paul's letters as they currently stand speak only of a non-terrestrial Christ.  In fact, Doherty makes this claim for all the New Testament epistles, which are thus presented as direct evidence -- people describing their own belief and thus directly attesting to the existence of the belief.  One trouble facing Doherty's thesis is that Paul's letters and the other early Christian documents speak of Christ's flesh and blood, and his birth and death; they also provide other indications of a terrestrial savior.  So a large part of Doherty's book consists of arguments to the effect that all these earthly-sounding words really referred to a "spiritual" death in the heavens.  A great deal of work has already been advanced against these arguments, and it does not need to be repeated here, except to say that no single piece of evidence for Doherty's thesis exists which is not ambiguous.  Doherty hardly denies this ambiguity, since it is his own contention that even the most terrestrial-sounding passages in the New Testament can be dismissed as metaphor rather than plain evidence for a historical Christ.  Thus, the main argument of this book is about a lack of evidence, that is to say, an argument from silence.  Doherty claims that the first ancient Christians are silent about an earthly Christ.  Again, much prior work has been done to show that this is far from true.  What I find interesting is that an argument from silence, though difficult to make and not generally favored by historians, can be legitimate, especially if combined with positive evidence.  In this case, if we could not combine it with such evidence we would face new arguments from silence that contradicted Doherty's thesis: Why are the proposed believers in the celestial Christ silent about so many details of their heavenly savior? And why do we not find ancient Christians, Jews, and pagans reporting or reacting to doctrines about a celestial Christ?  In this book, Doherty deals only with the second of these two questions.  He looks for ancient authors who tell us that others either believed in a celestial Christ or doubted the terrestrial Christ.  Since no ancient author tells us clearly about people who doubted that Christ appeared to be a flesh-and-blood man on the earth, Doherty proposes that we can find hints of such a thing.  In Appendix 3 of this book, he quotes a letter by Ignatius of Antioch to the Magnesians, written at the start of the second century, wherein Ignatius hopes that his readers will attain "full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate" (Magnesians 11:3).  This seems to Doherty like a polemic against a celestial Christ.  The principle he is using is a valid one, akin to when mainstream scholars use Paul's assurances about the Resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15 as evidence that doubts about the Resurrection existed.  But in that case, Paul tells us clearly what the doubts were.  Ignatius does not, and it will be worth a little effort here to go into the details.  Ignatius says earlier in his letter that some deny the death of Christ.  Today we call this the Docetic doctrine, which held that Christ merely appeared to be a human being but was actually only a spirit who appeared to die on the cross.  This doctrine is well-attested because so much ancient Christian literature seeks to refute it; and Doherty rightfully regards these refutations as different from the refutation that he is looking for, the proposed polemic against a Christ who did not even appear to walk on the earth.  Yet Ignatius mentions nothing like that.  He alludes to Docetism and to unspecified doctrines denying that Christ was the same as the one true God.  And he refers very specifically to Judaism, just before making his assurance about the birth, death, and resurrection in the time of Pilate's governorship of Judea.  He is telling his readers, in short, to have full assurance about things that both Docetism and Judaism are known to have challenged: the nature of this or any proposed savior's birth; his Passion under the Roman leadership in a Jewish province; and his Resurrection.  Doherty thinks that Ignatius is asking his readers to be "fully persuaded" of the bare facts of these things - the bare fact that they took place - but it hardly seems probable that Ignatius would be content to ask for that.  He is asking his readers to attain "full assurance" about all of the Church's interpretations and teachings concerning these things - to keep from straying into any kind of doctrinal dispute.  So he writes throughout his letter.  The ambiguity of Doherty's evidence prompts him to argue that there is so little clear evidence because orthodox Christianity changed, destroyed or neglected the evidence that was once there.  He uses this argument openly in a chapter claiming that at least some second-century Christians worshipped only God and rejected all savior figures.  Doherty presents the writings of Minucius Felix as a "smoking gun" to that effect, but he allows that the evidence is not as clear as we might want.  He tells us that it is the best evidence that can be expected, because clearer statements would never have "reached us through 2000 years of Christian censorship" (see p. 292).  That is the conspiracy theory.  Considering that Christianity has not wiped away all evidence of doctrines that it regarded as heresies, but instead has offered refutations of every heresy and preserved these refutations as a guide to the true faith, Doherty's claim is hard to believe.  A conspiracy to hide the truth can take place, Christians not excepted; the record of the past can be doctored, and has been.  But Doherty's specific claim is that Christianity's very first doctrines contained a purely celestial Christ, and that these doctrines have not been preserved even as heresy (with Ignatius serving as a brief and ambiguous exception).  Christianity's true origin was wiped away, not with refutation and doctoring, but with silence.  It is hard to believe that Christian institutions and individual writers were silent about what would have been the most radical and provocative of all the heresies -- silent about an idea that, per Doherty's central thesis about how religions work, would have threatened the Church's power to a greater degree than any of the other heresies, some of which were already regarded by Church Fathers as mortally dangerous to the Church.    So Doherty proposes one additional reason to explain the silence: he suggests that the Roman war against Palestine in the year 70 C.E. uprooted or destroyed so many lives that later writers could claim that Christ had lived there in recent decades, without challenges from locals who remembered either the true situation or the beliefs of the sect that worshipped a non-terrestrial Christ (see pages 168 and 179).  Doherty's picture is of a dying sect.  But a fundamental claim of Doherty's idea is the pervasiveness in the entire ancient world of the belief in saviors who descended to celestial regions above the earth and experienced pain or death there.  Had this sort of belief really been ubiquitous throughout the Empire, and applied to Christ as far as the church in Rome (to whom Paul addresses his longest letter), one war in Judea could not have extinguished the belief; and even in Judea it would be likely to reappear. Ignatius himself, per Doherty, is proof that the belief survived the war.  But if Doherty is right, we would expect such a popular doctrine to have flourished after the war.  We'd expect the orthodox sects of the Church proclaiming an earthly savior to produce some refutations.  The Fathers established in Rome, the center of all ideas, would surely have encountered or heard of the celestial Christ, for Doherty does not address how the celestial Christ of Paul's Letter to the Romans was just forgotten -- except by returning to the idea of censorship.  I invite any reader attracted by this book to work out Doherty's scenario and to test it repeatedly against the available information about the time period.  That's an external test.  Then test it against its own premises, repeatedly, for an internal test.  It is a worthy and rewarding challenge 
 William Bartram was a far better botanist than a writer.  This book was a great achievement in that it was really the first work of American nature writing, and Bartram made a lot of great botanical discoveries during his  journeys through the American Southeast.  But his language is  excruciatingly tedious.  He uses ten pages to express what probably could  be said in a single paragraph, and he often will offer two choices or  options, when one would suffice: "We encamped on a high cliff or  bluff..."  And although he makes some interesting observations about  the Cherokees, Creeks, and Seminoles, his views are often distressingly  unenlightened or idealized.  Although I love nature writing, and although I  love the works of Thoreau, who came just a half-century later, I found  Bartram's book painful to get through 
 I have to admit, I have forced myself to listen to Michael Weiner's abortion of a talkshow more than once.In a way it's almost humorous, until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously, they view him as a deep political thinker. He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't. What this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual. One would find more insightful comments at your state's mental hospital, or by a survey of several of your town's homeless population. I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it. The average IQ of the nation would increase, and perhaps we would then be able to listen to REAL political discourse, instead of a bunch of ignorant, partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another. 
 This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant "homemaker". If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too 
 basically... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! seriously he can't even solo over chord changes! i've heard him compared to the likes over SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd 
 This book isn't much more than a novelized screenplay -- kind of a  "Cape Fear" in a political setting -- and I can't recommend it to  anyone. But for those questioning its credibility: a state Senate candidate  in Tennessee has just been charged with the murder of his opponent, a  heavily favored incumbent who was killed on his farm. The parallels pretty  much stop there, but it's still eerie 
 The writer is very confused. His style and argumentation are a mix of John Stossel, Rush Limbaugh and Anne Coulter put together.   Here is what the official white house historians says about Jimmy Carter.  Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government "competent and compassionate," responsive to the American people and their expectations. His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations.   Carter, who has rarely used his full name--James Earl Carter, Jr.--was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn.   After seven years' service as a naval officer, Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers.    Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter campaigned hard against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times. Carter won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford.   Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured in percentage of the gross national product. Unfortunately, inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession.   Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. He sought to improve the environment. His expansion of the national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs.   In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union.   There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the news during the last 14 months of the administration. The consequences of Iran's holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter's defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.       
 They look nice, but the towels do not absorb much water.  I am very disappointed.  I suspect I'll use them a few times, then give them to Goodwill 
 Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.  In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.  I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired 
 I was encouraged to buy this book by all of its positive reviews, but was disappointed to find it to be almost completely useless for me. First, our training seminars are reasonably well established: I was looking to better "market and promote" them, as the title of the book says. Unfortunately there are only 2 or 3 pages on this subject in the entire book, and they are little more than recommendations to buy the books & tapes from other promoters that the author works with.  This book does not provide helpful information so much as it plugs the author's many other products that promise to do so. It reads like a self-help book from the 1990's.  I was looking for a professionally presented source of good usable information (something that we provide in our seminars) but instead got a hard lesson on used car salesmanship 101. I am confident that those who leave my seminars got their money's worth, but I expect that Fred Gleeck makes a lot more money at his. Two different ways of doing business, I guess 
 I'm going to wait until it gets cold enough to burn this guy's book. "Oblivion," couldn't be a better title, while reading these stories--I couldn't actually bear to finish even one of them-- you feel as if you have entered some circle of Hell, and your punishment is to have to read all this crap. This guy makes me mad, his prose actually bores into your skull, it feels like torture to read and you want to say enough, yes, I will tell you anything you want to hear, but please just shut the blank up 
 My daughter wanted a copy of the book of Psalms.  I thought I was buying her a lovely gift.  My mistake.  This book is about Psalms; it does not contain Psalms.  It is also very small, paperbacked, and not terribly impressive.    The content may be nice, but it's not the book of Psalms.  I just wanted everyone to know 
 I wish I did not order this one. The picture looks nice but when I got it today, I really got disappointed. When you look at it closer, the wood beads, sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking. I wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads.  
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 If you have any respect for the blues legend, don't buy this, don't even rent it. The very few decent tribute performances do not make up for the lack of content in this DVD. Pointless interviews and speeches make for annoying filler, when all we really want is the music. Especially disappointing is the performance by Weir/Wasserman. They rattle off a an aimless and depthless "Walkin' Blues" You can't help but feel that Wasserman would rather be somewhere else. Most irritating is the claim that this so-called conference "found" a "very rare" film clip of the man himself. It is presented to a lecture-hall audience, to which Robert Johnson's son was a part. When asked by the speaker if the man playing guitar was indeed Robert Johnson, he said clearly:"No." "Ummm...are you sure?"  "YES!" "Oh...well, so it may not be him, but is certainly LOOKS like him..." Why was this even included here? If it's NOT footage of Robert Johnson, then why didn't it wind up on the cutting room floor? Bleah 
 its really too bad the warning about thorsson being a satanist was removed from here. this is information that concerns the material of the book and the tone of the whole thing. i have it confirmed by the group of asatru that asked him to leave, that this is true, and he is also a priest of set. this colors all the books knowlege and is just a relavent to readers as any other information in these reviews 
 Talk to the Polish and South Koreans, and ask them why they do more with less.   
 Brokedown Palace is bad.  How bad is it?  It's pretty bad, man.  Don't tell me I didn't warn you 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 The color of the product I received is nothing like the picture! If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you 
 This book is terrible.  RaH takes a perfectly good murder mystery and turns in into...well, I don't quite know what.  Halfway through the book, it seems as though he had set it down for several years, came back to it to finish it off, but had nothing but nonsense on the brain.  I've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before, but this book absolutely takes the cake.  It's not even my book and I threw it in the trash so it won't waste another person's time ever again 
 I've read nearly every one of Danielle Steel's vast collection of novels...and this is "hands down" the VERY WORSE piece of garbage she's ever written.  What a joke!  It was as if one of Ms Steel's enemies broke into her house and forced her to write this mess!  Don't bother 
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 I bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my Rebel XT.  Amazingly, I find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit.  I find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless I correct the exposure using the menu.  Would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430EX are better, but I cannot recommend this one 
 I liked the second more but the first one sets up the background for the battle between good and evil.  The battle is in each of us as well as us against them.  I like the concept alot 
 Posing as a journalist Bill Kurtis has now shown that he has a very definite agenda, that being to abolish capital punishment, and not be persuading anyone that it is wrong for the state to kill, but repeating the half-truths and outright distortion of disgraced and indicted former Gov. George Ryan, who freed more than 150 stone cold killers off his state's death row. In his book tour, particularly on an appearance by Larry King, Kurtis shows that he is a tourist in the land of criminal justice. Those of us who live there know the facts are very different and while the system certainly makes mistakes, they are about as common as human rabies 
 I have never liked the character of Nefret.  I wish it had never been introduced to the Peabody series.  I hope the future books are better than this one 
 After reading several comments I tried to proof my scale is working properly. However, like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant. I weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings. Like some one else I even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands. The scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight. Now! A digital scale is supposed to be percise.. 
 Do not buy this book! Why, you ask? This is a quote from chapter 15, p.212: "In TV advertising, the manufacturers can get name publicity in two ways if they desire, namely, by flashing the product name in big print on the screen and by having the name frequently repeated by the announcer" (!). Now, you're probably wondering why I'm giving a quote from *PAGE 212!*. Well, that's because I forced myself to read this because it was written by some legendary ad guy. But don't make the same error as I did. Please buy Ogilvy on Advertising, Cutting Edge Adverting, Creative Advertising and Hey Whipple instead. Yes, all of them instead of Tested Advertising Methods. You won't be disappointed. Or your money back (just kidding) 
 If I could I would give this book no stars. I did not find anything in this book at all helpful. I bought this when I first got married in hopes that would give me some sort of insight into marriage and my husband. Now 4 years down the line, I learned this book is nothing but rubbish. Foremost I did not care for the author Kevin Leman. He seems like just your typical egotistical male writing a book with the thoughts that all women are fragile little butterflies in a cocoon and all men are barbaric sex maniacs. I am not in anyway a feminist, but unfortunately in alot of marriages the stereotypical "You Jane, Me Tarzan" does not fit. In my case, this was so, which is why this book was of little use to me. I will give it a little credit. In a way, it made me realise how lucky I was that my husband came no where near the way this guy was describing men! Maybe it is a good book for those in "typical" relationships. But, not a good book if you or your significant other falls out of the lines of the "typical" male and female behavior 
 Let me start by saying, i respect these girls immensly. Cocorosie are in a class all their own, they are 100% experiemental. But sometimes as a musician, that either pays off or not so much. In this case, not so much. Although some of the songs are pretty, most of it just sounds like a bad acid trip at a circus. Which makes them really fun to see live. Throughout the whole concert i was mezmerised by their theatrics, their voices, and their stage prescence. Will i put their cd in my player and listen to it alone? No, not in less i want the scary clowns to come out and attack me. Yikes 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 I have been reading the history of this period for over forty years. This is the worst bunk I have ever read. Here are my reasons. 1, He fails to cite his sources. 2,He fails to prove his thesis. 3,He contradicts the very title by stating that books never vanished from Italy, Greece, and the most Romanized parts of the western Roman world. 4,He pads the book with a ton of extraneous info that has nothing to do with the topics. 5,He inexplicably bashes other groups for no reason. Lastly, the so-called style is a disorganized, and incoherent rambling. I suggest that before anyone wastes their money. They read all of the reviews of this book wih a fine tooth comb and an open mind 
 Robert Laughlin is a great physicist who has found some truly important insights about condensed matter physics in general and the fractional quantum Hall effect in particular, and he deserves his 1998 physics Nobel prize.  But his attempts to say something profound about fundamental physics and particle physics seem far less serious. Be sure that my opinion is shared not only by a huge majority of "fundamental physicists" but even by many colleagues of Laughlin in condensed matter physics. The main problem with his reasoning is that he has obviously no solutions for the problems he tries to address.   All of us agree that some important features of physical phenomena do not depend on the details of underlying physics; many of these phenomena are emergent in character; it is not too important or useful to know quarks or strings in order to study most of the important concepts in biology, climate, physics of water, or quantum computing. If Laughlin thinks that other physicists do not realize this fact, then he is fighting a strawman. Most physicists realize these things - and many fundamental physicists actually use very similar mathematical techniques as Laughlin does in his "emergent" approach.  But at the same moment, there are contexts - and particle physics and/or fundamental physics is a textbook example - where we simply do need to ask different questions. We need to know what natural laws underlie the phenomena we observe at longer distances. We need to find more fundamental, more elementary, and usually smaller constituents of the matter and the interactions that control their dynamics.   We need to study these questions whenever we want to determine physics more accurately; we also need to study these questions because we want to acquire a deeper knowledge that is necessary for future constructions of emergent theories; we need to investigate the underlying physics in order to illuminate some features and parameters of the effective theories that the effective theories themselves simply don't explain and can't explain. People have been looking for more fundamental theories of the real world for quite some time, they have made a tremendous progress in this reductionist quest, and the reductionist approach is responsible for many of the achievements of the modern era. If there were no reductionists in the 19th and 20th centuries, electrons would not have been discovered and Laughlin could probably never construct the wavefunction for which he was awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences.  Laughlin seems to misunderstand these points. He thinks that his dislike for particle physics is a valuable idea by itself. It's not. He has nothing to say about these issues, and therefore silence would be better for him and for everyone else. The same conclusion holds for Laughlin's opinions about the black holes and other issues in the realm of fundamental physics.   Laughlin seems to believe that the condensed matter physics way of thinking is very rare among particle physicists, string theorists, and general relativists, and therefore it is very important for him to present conjectures that the black holes are made of plastic or something very similar. But such conjectures are not too useful because fundamental physics simply does not work in this way. If physics of polymers were important for the research of black holes, it is very likely that the black hole physicists would be forced to figure out how to apply these rules even without the help of Prof. Laughlin.  The book uses many metaphors from the everyday life. The author usually offers ten sentences even though his simple and shallow idea is completely clear already from the sentence number one. Several chapters at the end of the book are redundant as wholes.  You don't need to read this book. The main ideas can be summarized as follows: Prof. Laughlin believes that we should always be satisfied with a superficial description of physical phenomena and we should never try to look "inside" in order to identify more elementary components. Prof. Laughlin is wrong, he has nothing to say about the important questions that Laughlin believes are unimportant, he actually says nothing about most of the important questions in the reductionist vs. emergent debate, and you better save your money and time 
 This book is an okay start.  It has less mistakes in it than the older edition, but there are still some.  It is definitely not enough preparation though.  
 I think this book would be much more appreciated by experienced sailors.  As an armchair enthusiast with only a small amount of sailing knowledge I was quickly bogged down with all of the technical jargon.   I never got that feeling of being "there" and identifying with the people and the crises that I had hoped for 
 If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his "Official Religious Disclaimer" at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading 
 Buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the TV you will be left on your own to sort it out. Amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company, but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email (run around)!! Bare that in mind before making any large purchase, may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back 
 I've been a fan of Heinlein's SF for just about as long as I've been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.  The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.  For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of "fascism" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.  And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.)  Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. "The Pragmatics of Patriotism", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen.  Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.  Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. Asimov's reputation as the "great explainer" is in no danger here.  This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.  And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer 
 The Greens cookbook is a shoddy, carelessly dashed together list of recipes suitable for use only in a fully stocked restaurant kitchen. Another review pointed out that the recipes are not designed for use outside of the Greens' kitchen. Most recipes require (usually included in small print in the recipe itself) the previous completion of another exceptionally complicated recipe (often fanciful stocks, for which no substitutes are ever given). Some recipes require the previous completion of TWO other recipes, vegetarian shepherd's pie, for example, which should be a fairly simple recipe. Nearly a third of the recipes are pizzas, which I don't need a cookbook for) and the pizza dough recipe (again given in small print at the bottom) is for one 10-inch pizza. Who, I ask, is ever going to make individual pizzas at home? There are also no pictures. This is by far the most useless, arrogant, and user-unfriendly cookbook I have ever tried to cook with, the culinary equivalent of a punch to the kidneys 
 This is not what I expected or wanted.  The book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature.  The description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use 
 NOT like "Q" in James Bond.  This book is about empire-building, politics, the "Potomac shuffle game" and wasting taxpayer money.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 I purchased two of these items through Amazon.  One of the units worked briefly, then quit; the other never worked at all.  Under the vendor's return policy, I returned these items (at my own expense) to the vendor for a refund and ordered two more directly from the vendor.  Only one of these additional two units worked.  That's three out of four defective--a 75% failure rate, and the buyer has to pay the return costs.  Further, this is not the first time I've had problems with "GE SmartHome" products.  An earlier purchase of other items of the same brand from another vendor also produced defective merchandise.  I would give these items ZERO "stars," if that were possible 
 This books makes a weak attempt to jump on the money wagon of Left Behind.  It fails miserably in several ways.  First, the plot has nothing to do with anything in the bible.  If you enjoyed Left Behind, this book will only annoy you.  The plot wanders around making the reader think it might pick up and get interesting.  It doesn't.  Technical parts of the plot are annoying as well.  For example, an ohm meter is used to check voltage on a fence.  The author needs to get his basic electrical concepts straight before writing stuff like this.  Other science in the book is similar, with vague references to data that really mean nothing or are simply wrong.  Overall, the book reads like it is the author's first attempt at writing a novel.  Some characters are good, but the plot development and foundation is so weak the characters can't succeed in salvaging it 
 I made it through the introduction and most of the first chapter of this book.  By that time I had smoke coming out of my ears and my blood pressure had gone way up.  This woman managed to trash working women, ethnic groups, women who choose not to have children, and women who, because of economics, have to work.  But when she said that children of working mothers always turn out bad I had to quit reading.  She managed to quote that old standby that working women were "taking jobs away from men".  And she brought up the person that she sees as a purveyor of evil, Hillary Clinton.  She should read Proverbs 31:10-31 
 I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time.  I couldn't force myself to get to the end.  Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't.  The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable.  I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
 In terms of both format and style - and despite its superficially modernist tendencies - "Rent" has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like "Phantom of the Opera," which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like "Rent," which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers "Rent" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, "Rent" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.  The story, a modern day update of "La Boheme" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990.  This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story).  There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them "deadbeats") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.  "Rent" - with its noble "performance artists" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's.  Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as naï¿½ve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical "Angel") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man).  Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America.  When one of the men finally takes a dreaded "job" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck.  I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them.   With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing.   In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching.  Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.    As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling.  One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of "the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.  It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.    There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture.  In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it.   I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for "Rent" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially "sensitive" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free 
 A thin soup of potty humor, fart jokes, and juvenile cheap laughs. You know something is terribly wrong when you are halfway through a comedy and you haven't even cracked a smile.  Good gawd, Dustin Hoffman sitting on the toilet?  Robert DeNiro breastfeading a baby? Foreskin dropped into a fondue pot?  Wow, a movie that hurt to watch.  It wasn't even worth renting for free from the public library.      
 The book was supposed to ship two day ground but showed up 3 days late 
 I puchased the LS 100's to get a decent speaker for a great price. I was disappointed. I knew the bass response would not be astonding but it was almost non existant. The midrange and the highs are scratchy.   I would not recommend the speakers for anything other than talk radio 
 I don't know why this inferior version is still listed--and is more money than the remastered re-issue with 5 bonus tracks. Amazon failed to list those tracks, but I've done so in a review for that version 
 Before I start on this idiot-magnet, let me get one thing straight - Jackass was a GOOD TV show. For all it's gross-out moments, there were moments of genuine class and originality.  And I guess I know where they came from. On the one hand, we have Johnny Knoxville, who has moved on from Jackass to become a genuine star in Hollywood, going from mainstream success (Dukes of Hazzard) to critical acclaim (Grand Theft Parsons) in just a couple of years. A genuine talent, and someone to watch in the future.  Then we have Bam Margera, who took his "is cruel to his parents" thing from Jackass and made an entire show out of it. And it quite simply the most crass, unfunny and utterly, utterly FAKE rubbish on television.  It's maybe a pity Bam didn't have parents who were, I dunno, better actors than they are, because their "outraged" responses to his ha-ha-larious stunts wouldn't seem out of place at a Sunday school play. The mother is the worst offender, and while Bam's stupid tagalong friends laugh in all the right places, there is a genuine cruel streak and nasty side to Bam that makes the whole program have a very bitter after-taste. I'd like to see what would happen if one of the yahoo's DIDN'T laugh or go along with everything.   Of course, this show isn't aimed at the likes of The Curmudgeon. It's aimed at the big-shorted dumbass kids who think Avril Lavigne RAWWWWKS and can't see another phony being stuffed down their easily pleased, "Hey Kids, This Is COOL" MTV propoganda-fed throats.  A loathsome, spoilt man child abusing his stupid mother and morbidly obese father? You wonder why it doesn't work. Then you remember it's one-trick pony Bam Margera, a guy pushing 30 who still tries to act like he's 14. And that his mother and father are in on every single second of it. Another pitiful MTV product that you should steer well clear of.  [... 
 I really dont`t know how people can give 5 stars to this book. It`s clear that they don`t know nothing about photography books. It is true that in this book you can see almost all bresson`s photographs but you`ll see many of them in a small size. If I payed 47.25 for this book I expect to receive quality and not a lot of photographies printed in two pages (For me the concept of printing an image in two pages is unacceptable). There isn't a selection of the work in this book. I prefer a book with less photographs but well printed than this book where you have lots of images but in bad print. After spending a lot of money in this book try another of Bresson`s books. Surelly you`ll get better quality for less price 
 I expected it to suck the gunk out of my skin...Or at least bring it close to the surface so that i could easily take it off....it didn't..too bad for me 
 When I saw this movie as a young boy, I loved it.  I saw it later in life, having served 4 years in the USMC, and I found it way off the mark.  I was very disappointed 
 After hearing Ice Box I was very excited to hear the rest of the album. This album was supposed to be somewhat dark and haunting. Exactly what Ice Box contains. A dark and haunting melody. The rest of the album is completely trash. So if you read this. You're best buying the single for Ice Box 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value.   Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.    About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.  
 I always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous, now I've seen the opposite. Taxcut online seems totally not thorough, such as just asking for total of certain things, and not asking if special circumstances apply, which you don't miss at all until you have one of them. I had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home. I moved half way through the year. I couldn't find where to add an additional home office listing. "Nope, can't do it" said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting, "you'll have to use another product." So today I start from scratch and pay the $99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners. I encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year. s: 
 I thought this dumb CD blew chunks and I sold it to the Used CD store a few days after I bought it....what a "let-down" after such a cool-ass remix of Metallica's "For Whom The Bell Tolls" on the  Spawn CD 
 I'll be honest: From the trailer, commercials, and the very fact that it contained both Ben Stiller and Jack Black, I was expecting at least something stupid enough that it was funny.  Despite the horrible reviews when it was released, I still somewhat eagerly went to see "Envy".  Halfway through the movie I almost left, but forced myself to stay, hoping that it would get at least a little better.  To say the least: It didn't.  I left the theater depressed and regretfull over the 7 bucks I paid for the ticket, and the hour and a half lost seeing it.  This movie is easily one of the worst comedies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of comedies.  Bed Stiller's performance couldn't be more disappointing, and Jack Black stupid antics weren't funny in the least.  Honestly, I think there was MAYBE one time in the entire length of the film that I chuckled, and that was forced.  Nothing in this movie was funny, just dull and boring, plus the plot is bull, and doesn't end up anywhere else from where it started.   If you're looking for something stupid but funny as hell, this is NOT it.  "Envy" is a total waste of time, with the only humorous thing being the time and money the producers put into this load of s**t.  Don't believe anyone who promotes this movie, though I haven't met anyone who has (Heck, most of my friends who saw this movie didn't even finish it)  Trust me, if you buy this movie, or even rent it, you will pay dearly.  Keep the money: You could buy a pizza (A much better investment).  
 I thought this was going to be a book of funny and interesting items about the south and southerners. What it turned out to be is a text book! I tossed it into the trash, but pulled it back out so I can donate it to Goodwill 
 I enjoy this book the least out of Dr. Virtue's books.  There is a tension between her 'channeled' sources, some of which conflict with published and oral traditions of a living culture.  I am referring to her description of the goddess Pele in Hawaiian culture.  There are many versions of the myth, but all of them contain substantially the same information.  Hi'iaka i ka poli a Pele, for example, is Pele's younger sister, nourished by her in her armpit, not her older sister as Dr. Virtue writes.  Pele is also not a goddess of fire, but of the volcano.  There are so many mistakes in this description and it is disrespectful to the Hawaiians, who are custodians of a vibrant and sacred culture.  I received my Ph.D. in Hawaiian culture a few years ago, and channel myself, hunalight.com so realize this is a uniquely sensitive topic.   When I contacted her editor with the mistakes, I didn't even receive the courtesy of a reply, although she admitted she received the mail.  Surely the editor should be working with Dr. Virtue in checking the information for future editions?  It is distressing, and disrespectful, when these mistakes aren't acknowledged and makes me wonder about the goddesses I am not so familiar with and sadly the book itself has lost credibility for me... Dr. Virtue is doing an important job in getting inspirational messages out to the world, surely the publisher should be working with her to review any genuine mistakes?  
 I wouldn't recommend this video.  It just didn't get into enough detail to be useful for me.  Basically, this video just shows you what you already intuitively should know.  I'd spend my money on a baby book or maybe try another video 
 By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie 
 I read Bonfire, Man In Full, Right Stuff, and Hooking Up, and then tried this one. I could not stand it! Amazing some of these reviews. If you read one of the above and want to try another, stick to that list. Electric Kook-Aide is difficult to read if you like a story that flows and becomes a page turner 
      I believe that I was possibly unlucky to choose this book as my introduction to Mr. Yehoshua's work, for I am told that he is a fabulous writer and a fine creator of believable dialogues.  Well, there are no dialogues, and the story drags.  The book however had many characteristics that should make me love it!  My training is that of a historian, I fancy -- in my spare time -- reading on the Middle Ages, I've been fascinated with travel writing, I've lived in North Africa and to top it off, I've done some reading on Judaism in the Iberian Penninsula. And yet this book proved to be a collection of frustrations and it appeared never to end.      Mr. Yehoshua chose to base his narrative in the oral tradition typical not only to the Middle Ages but also present in Jewish and North African traditions.  So the development of his story is as repetitive as those told from generation to generation, to remind each of the listeners the main characteristcs of what's being mentioned.  He does it however without the charm that a colloquial narrator would infuse.  This distant omnipresent narrator who tells us the  story instead took away any sense of drama, of importance, of eagerness, and of deeply felt conflicts.  The narrative line seemed adrift, like a boat going from port to port without a chart.         There was also not a single character that involved this reader emotionally.  It felt like an intellectual exercise that ended up being too boring to stand.  It was a struggle for me to finish the book and frankly, life is too short for the daily sacrifice I was inflicting on myself.   
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 THE AUTHOR WROTE THIS BOOK ON HEARSAY AND RESEARCH, BUT ACTUALLY NEVER GOT TO KNOW THE REAL MAN HE WROTE ABOUT. MANY UNTRUE AND UNFAIR SEGMENTS APPEAR IN THE BOOK. ONE WHICH IS THE MOST UPSETTING IS THE STORY TOLD BY A FORMER PHILADELPHIA POLICE DETECTIVE WHO BASED HIS OWN STORY ON HEARSAY AND HIS OWN DESIRE TO BE MENTIONED IN THE BOOK: IT EXPLAINS A TIME WHEN FRANK RIZZO MADE DEALS WITH "THE MOB" WHEN IN REALITY ALL HIS LIFE HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT HE AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM WERE COPS. NOTHING UPHALLED HIM MORE THAN THE FACT THAT SOMEONE OF HIS OWN ITALIAN ORIGIN WOULD COMMIT SUCH HORRIBLE CRIMES. HE WAS VERY PROUD THAT HE DID IN FACT LOCK UP ANYONE WHO COMMITTED A CRIME NO MATTER WHO AND WHERE THEY CAME FROM, ESPECIALLY, ITALIANS. ANY REFERENCE TO DEALMAKING WAS PURELY "SPICE" TO SELL THE BOOK. FRANK RIZZO OVER THE YEARS TOLD THE STORY HIMSELF ABOUT HOW HE WARNED THE MOB NOT TO EVEN TRY TO DO ANYTHING WRONG AS LONG AS HE WAS AROUND. (THE RASH OF PHILLY MOB KILLINGS STARTED 3 MONTHS AFTER HE LEFT OFFICE) I THINK I SPEAK FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO READ THE BOOK WHO REALLY KNEW THE MAN. THE AUTHOR TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ON THE BOOK BUT DID NOT CHECK HIS SOURCES EXCEPT FOR THOSE OF MANY WHO HAD VENDETTAS AGAINST THE FORMER MAYOR OR FROM THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER WHICH NEVER SUPPORTED HIS VIEWS. AS A GUIDE TO PHILLY POLITICS IT RATES VERY WELL BUT AS A BIOGRAPHY, IT IS FICTION ON THE MOST PART AND AS I SAID UNFAIR TO A MAN WHO SPENT HIS LIFE TO DO GOOD FOR HIS CITY AND IT'S RESIDENTS. BY THE WAY HE DIED WHILE TRYING TO SAVE THE CITY  HE LOVEED SO WELL. THIS BOOK IS IN LINE WITH MANY OF FORMER BIOS ON FAMOUS PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER HERE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES 
 Initially I got into the book and began to enjoy it.  HOwever, my stomach and enjoyment of the book began to take a serious nosedive as the character of Candice began to be revealed.  All enjoyment of the storyline was removed once Candice found out one of her ancestors was black. The fact that she suddenly considered herself to be a black woman was beyond comprehension.  I cannot fathom what Briscoe was doing in writing such a thing or where she felt that this was going.  It is one thing to acknowledge that there was once a one drop rule, but to take it to this extent in a book written by a black woman no less was pretty disconcerting.  Perhaps there is something deeper here that I am missing.  I really hope so.  Overall I would say the book was lacking in depth.  It is one of those books that you might take along on vacation when you know you want something light to read, but not something heavy that is going to require lots of thought and analysis.  Perhaps others will enjoy the soap opera style writing, but I did not 
 Don't waste your money and time with this trash. If I could I would give it a -5 rating 
 I liked this book at first, it had an interesting group of characters, a solid voice and good potential for conflict. Unfortunately, it took a terrible turn after the first one hundred pages and I ended up hating it.   At it's worst it's teeming with stereotypes and ridiculous dialogue. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes. The gay husband is ridiculous. The white deaf old lady and her black housekeeper who is her best friend? Ridiculous. You've seen it all before and, trust me, you probably didn't like it the first time.   It didn't feel like the author really understood her characters because they were constantly disregarding themselves. Frannie says in one breath that she hates Arthur and wouldn't call him until her fingers rotted and in the next breath is urging Anna to sleep with him. It made the characters seem inauthentic.  What conflict there was in the beginning falls into boring retelling. It should be a drinking game how many time Anna tells her gay ex-husband that she loves him and vice versa. It was just played out. Boring. Overdone in all the wrong places, underdone in all the rest. Very disappointing 
 I really regret buying this cd...the songs are just really annoying and sound all the same. The majority of them arent even that catchy either.....it seems like they used the first ideas that came to their heads in most of the songs.  A couple of songs are pretty good though: promise, the greatest fall(old version is better though), playing for keeps, etc.  Even as a person who listens to music that is often considered emo (motion city soundtrack, fall out boy, panic! at the disco, the starting line, underoath) this cd is way too emo even for me.....now i am starting to see why so many people hate emo...its because of bands like matchbook romance. 
 Does not show you techniques rather it just shows pictures!  After buying this book- I was very disappointed since I thought it will show me makeup tips and tricks, rather it just shows displays of women's faces.  You will waste your money on purchasing this book 
 I still don't really know why I bought this CD in the first place.  Probably because I liked the song "I Can Love You Like That" and figured the rest of the CD would be equally good.  WRONG.  I detest every  other song on here.  The only reason for the two star rating is because of  the strength of that one song 
 This story could have been an interesting read but it wasn't. It was like a story boringly told by a narrator. Terrible read. It was not like a true story book at all. The intrigue,suspense and mystery were missing. I felt like I was reading a bunch of articles clumped together. It was very boring,I had to skip many pages at a time to get through the book it was terribly boring. Very Disappointed. 
 ...because that's how he makes his money and fame. Without it, he'd be known for what he ultimately is: a poor charlatan posing as a "scholar. 
 I think Apple's best products are those designed to do just one thing.  By focusing one one task, the unneccessary complexity and useless features are kept to a minimum.  But I was intrigued by this book since my dream is an iPod that also does what a Palm does.    Unfortunately, Steve Jobs does not share my desire for this simple goal.  I bought this book thinking there really was a way to expand my iPod's data handling ability.  Well, there are ways but as Ihnatko clearly points out they are simply too difficlut to bother with.  I give him two stars for being honest about the hassles involved in trying to make an iPod do what its not intended to do.  So...we will have iPods that let you watch Desperate Housewives in 3D, but an iPod with a voice recorder, memory card slot and the ability to make and retrieve notes appears to be an impossible dream.  Of course that's not the fault of this book.  The fact that its possible to write a 250 page book on how to use a music player is pretty scary.  
 I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET THIS BOOK!  WHEN I STARTED READING I WAS BORED OFF THE BACK.  IT WAS TOO DETAILED ABOUT THINGS I REALLY DID NOT CARE ABOUT.  TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WHAT HAPPENED TO LIL E?  WHAT HAPPENED WITH PHILLIPS.  ALL IN ALL THIS BOOK WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING AND BORING.  HOPE NEXT BOOK WILL BRING MORE DRAMA LIKE THE FIRST TWO.  GOOD LUCK 
 As some of the previous authors have already noted, this book is cleary marked for the conspiracy minded, and those who hate the Japanese monarchy.  It is revisionist history at its extreme.  Also it takes a lot of swipes at the Republican Party, even though it is a book about the Japanese monarchy.  It is dedicated to Diane Fienstein, the liberal Democratic Senator from California.  Where to begin? Up to Chapter 9, this was a very believable book.  It discussed the Meiji and Tashio Emperors and the first stages of Hirohito's rule.  Then it became unbelievable.  First it talked about how Roosevelt let Pearl Harbor happen.  There have been many books about this but suffice to say, this is VERY REVISIONIST, and probably not true.  Then it questions the courage of MacArthur.  Most historians don't debate his courage, but the Seagraves thought they could throw it in there.  It also suggested MacArthur was interested in the 1940 Republican nomination, when this is clearly not true.  Then it talks about the 1936 coup attempt in Tokyo as being very liberal, when in fact they were very militeristic and anti democractic.  This book takes swipes at Hoover as encouraging the corruption of the post war Japanese government and suggested he took a bribe of several million dollars.  Hoover devoted most of his life to public service and charities, so it is hard to believe the Seagrave's nonsense.  Then there were all the stories of the billions of dollars of gold and gems looted from the conquered Asian countries.  There were so many billions tossed around as sure facts, that I lost track if there was that much gold in the world. The Seagraves then detail all the corruption of post war Japan and blame it on Americans, the monarchy, and the rich strata of Japan.  It was hard to read this stuff when the documentation is just not there.   This is a hard book to swallow.  Part of this book is history, and the last 100 pages is pure fiction.  When an author puts one controversial subject in a book, it is open to discussion.  These authors threw in literally a hundred controversial subjects (loot, gold, blame for Pearl Harbor, corruption,) and ask the reader to believe them.  Please!!!!  Stick to the facts Seagraves, and no more treasure stories.  One gets sick of so much fantasy in a history book.   
 First, this shoe runs small, a full size at that. Most importantly the only thing that could make this shoe wearable without mind numbing, jaw clenching, tear jerking pain is a local anesthetic. Steve Madden must Hate Women, this is the third Madden shoe I've bought that was painful beyond description. I thought maybe the first time it was simply that particular shoe and it's design, but the 2nd and 3rd were progressively more painful than the first. Every person involved in producing Steve Madden shoes should be sentenced to wearing them for a full year. 
 This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.  
 Most DeBarge songs are very good, but I purchased this collection specifically for "Rhythm of the Night".  I was very disappointed when I listened to the dance mix, which is the only version of the song on this CD. The drum beat is significantly louder, and an echo effect is used on some of the words. This CD should have included the original mix of the song, not just a crappy remix. I will sell this disc back at my local CD store, and will look for a DeBarge greatest hits collection with the original "Rhythm of the Night" 
 After one washing of the pearl grey towels, they are ruined :(  They look as if they were washed with bleach.   Terrible streaks running through them.   Now they can not be used if guests are coming over.  Its true, you get what you pay for. I will replace these with a better product. I  gave this product one star because that was the least allowed, but it should get zero stars 
 Pity the student using this textbook for a Differential Equations course. The Boyce & DiPrima text is unduly cumbersome with lacking explanation and poorly choosen examples throughout.   Many problems given in the text are tedious, and are indicated as being "technologically intensive." This is fine: in today's workplace, one can anticipate using a computer to solve problems. Unfortunately, none of my math professors will let me bring out my laptop on an exam. In some of the chapters, almost every problem is indicated as being "technologically intensive." If the computer-oriented problems weren't bad enough, the examples in the text are. Most of these are sorely unclear. I think that Boyce & DiPrima must have been writing in Fermat's marginal notes style when composing this text. Many times the omitted steps (which the authors sometimes regard as "it is clear that") require substantial algebraic and calculus manipulation to achieve the indicated results. Certainly I have no qualms about a text leaving out algebraic or even trigonometric simplifications, but what's left out of the Boyce & DiPrima examples is truely excessive. Worse, still, the examples are often very generic to a single type of problem. Thus, while one type of problem in the exercises might have good examples to instruct students on how to achieve solutions, the rest of the exercises often lack example altogether. Explanation and orientation to applied math is poor. The authors jump suddenly from a confusing theory discourse to an application without bridging the two. Many times I was left puzzled by how the text was proceeding. Still many more times I set the book aside in frustration.  This book does, however, have redeeming values. I like how all of the problems have their solutions provided in the back. If only other math textbook authors took the hint: students won't know how well they're doing if they cannot confirm their results! Also, the included software is good. I found it easy to use and helpful for the computing problems. I wish, however, more attention was given to this software in the text (like small projects using the software with each chapter). These benefits unfortunately do not overcome the tremendous flaws with the Boyce & DiPrima text.  Overall, this is one of the worst math books I have encountered. Rife with poor explanation, a confusing style, and poor exercise sets, the Boyce and DiPrima textbook is bound to cause grief for most students. The student's solution manual is helpful, but offers only little more explanation than the textbook. If you are hapless enough to have this text as a course requirement, I recommend that you either swap classes to try and get a course with a different book - or - be prepared to spend many long hours with tutors or your professor.  Good luck.  [...

 I have used this pillow for several months, and find that the fiberfill has shifted so that the pillow is lumpy and shapeless. It is no longer possible to sleep comfortably with this product 
 John Horgan is one of those intellectually challenged journalists who only want to write about big things because they are too proud to be interested in any particular "small" question that science tries to solve. So many of these journalists choose a truly big theory - namely that there is something seriously wrong with the scientific method and with science and that science may be ending.  Of course, the scientists consider all such journalists and "thinkers" to be cranks, for a very good reason. The very existence of our civilization - something that distinguishes most of us from the monkeys - is based on certain general principles that also underlie science and these principles will never be given up unless the whole humankind is really doomed.  Careful thinking that is as quantitative as possible and the elimination of ideas that have turned out not to be viable are two examples of such principles.  John Horgan, is his attempt to earn his 15 minutes of fame - plus some bucks - has written this nasty book that not only offered a whole sequence of possible theories how science can finally be killed and how horrible science is. This book was also full of personal attacks against the scientists, their appearance, their voice, and all of their other superficial and unimportant characteristics.   John Horgan was - and still is - just far too dumb to be able to look into the scientists' thoughts, the entities that make the scientists important. At least, he could analyze their "quirkiness" and write confusing stories about the scientists and aliens that have nothing to do with the essence of the research done by the actual scientists.  Such crappy books have always found a lot of readers who eagerly buy them. However, the books have no lasting value. It's been almost 10 years since the book was released, and all of its predictions look even more absurd now than they looked 10 years ago. The science hasn't ended, Edward Witten is still the most respected physicist, and John Horgan is still just a despicable nobody.  Also, this book is the 360,000th most successful book at amazon.com; compare with The Elegant Universe that has been among the top 1,000 books more or less for the whole time. Nevertheless, the big doomsayers and science-haters will never close their mouth. So they still flood the book market with many new crappy books that are very similar to Horgan's book - Troubles with Physics, Not Even Wrong, and various feminist diatribes against the male science - books that will surely share the fate of this nonsense written by Horgan. But before the time will speak, thousands of new stupid consumers will buy these books and they will say how terribly inspiring the content is 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 This book to find Mr./Ms. Right is written by a man divorced three times...  If the author is having that much trouble, maybe he isn't the best source for this topic 
 I bought this video for my husband - an avid golfer.  This doesn't compare with the movies profiling the lives of Bobby Jones or Francis Ouimet 
 Don't get me wrong.. I got sucked in by Daylight too.. but the fact is.. Aesop Rock is NOT Canibus. His lyrics DO NOT make sense.. his lyrics have never made any cohesive sense for more than two bars at a time.  The only songs even remotely worth keeping on this album are No Regrets, which is actually surprisingly well written, the excellent Daylight, and 9-5er's Anthem which is also average.  Check out Bazooka Tooth, it's Aesop's most well-produced and written album 
 sublime is an all around good band with great soul and inspirations, but this album is more like a sign of what was to come for the boys. sadly, i think they would have been way too alternative mainstream if brad would have lived...alongside bands like red hot chili peppers and 311 for eternity...my advice is to stick with Iron Maiden. very random of a recommendation, but youll be surprsied how some bands just fall apart compared to others...but if you really want some reggae So-Cal punk, get 40 oz to freedom and Robbin the Hood 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 This map, while being very colorful, left off a major road to Chianti, which got us totally lost. Also, the paper began to separate in the folds after just a few openings. Look elsewhere 
 This was purchased as part of a gift for my brother-in-law for Christmas. We gave it to him with several other small items, but I don't think he was impressed, and I don't think he used it. The kit itself is a small one, like the kind you find in bookstore check out lines and would make a much better stocking stuffer or easter basket accent than a real gift. I would not have picked it out if I had realized it's size 
 As a parent of 3 boys who love Star Wars, we are constantly purchasing books.  We have always purchased them at Borders (or stores of the like).  This was the first time I purchased a book on-line thru Amazon.  Within ONE MONTH the binding came unglued.  This has never occured with any of the other Star Wars books we've purchased.  My boys are very protective of their books and take care of them.  We now have a book with the hard-cover off and I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and due to this do not plan on purchasing online thru Amazon if this is the quality I am to expect in the future 
 I have bought quite a few barbies from Amazon recently, including the caligirl series, fashion fever series, and barbie loves micky mouse. This barbie is quite different to all above. She does not have a rubber skin like others, so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts. Her foot is quite flat; only the slippers in this package fit her; all other barbies' shoes do not. I guess this "pooh" might be made with the "former generation" technology 
 Considering the fact that the University of California - Berkeley boasts the largest repetoire {sp?} of school songs of ANY university in the country makes the fact that this compilation has not included ANY of them problematic at the very least.  Big C (or Sons of Westwood to you theiving baby bears out there) - Fight for California - Sons of California - Stanford Jonah - Golden Bear - Make Way for the Bear - Roll On - Cal Band March - California Triumph - Palms of Victory - California Indian Song - California Marching Song - One More River - All Hail - Hail to California - California, We're For You --  Take your pick - they are all fantastic - and I think I forgot a few...  To leave out Cal is either shoddy work or bad temperment.  Go Bears - Beat the Cougars 
 Unless you are interested in a running commentary on the lead character's peek-a-boo clothes, this is not the book for a serious reader.  If there is any science fiction in this book I failed to find it.  I will be sure to NOT read any other books by C J Ryan.  I can only assume the author is a frustrated stripper wantabe 
 I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat.  He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months.  He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard.  Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor.  He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor.  This seat is quite tipsy 
 To put it simply, Freedom Evolves is a philosophical failure, with as many holes as a Hollywood movie. I give the book one star for effort, for the attempt to get philosophy to the masses, and for pure entertainment purposes. But I subtract four stars because the premise is yet another arrogant attempt by a philosopher to gain a piece of the philosophical pie, one that I feel was eaten a long time ago, with mere crumbs remaining for contemporary thinkers. Dennett does not by any stretch get a crumb for this one.  Despite the myriad long-winded and frightened attempts to get around the harsh yet incredibly simple reality and logic of determinism, I have yet to see any valid arguments by any philosopher to even begin to disprove it. I'll go so far as to agree that we perceive an illusion of free will due to the individuality in character of each human being, based upon one's initial genetic programming and thereafter one's environmental programming, but that's as far as it can possibly go. We're still bound by cause and effect, just like every single other thing in the universe, "alive" or not. To think or state otherwise is merely another case of human self-flattery and arrogance, and therefore outright ignorance (or, in Dennett's case, opportunism to boot). The potential proof of parallel universes in physics will still have no bearing on the issue. And evolution, as Dennett attempts it, works more against his arguments than for them.  Recommended if you enjoy pop philosophy for clever entertainment only. Otherwise, with all the logical holes in it, you could use the book to strain your spaghetti 
 If you learn by example this book is for you.  It is filled with stories about other people who have successfully made the transition from one long term career to another.   Supposedly this proves  that it can be done.   However, the book is also laced with statistics and other information that  will make you think twice about trying.  Rather than giving encouragement,  as the title suggests, this book is really quite frightening. It is not a  "how to" book. Nor did I find it helpful 
 Once again, Universal gives a good Tv show, a terrible release on DVD.  As with their other TV shows and now some of their movies, the picture and sound have improved but there are no bonus features.  In some cases, the shows were cut and paste edited, some of the music was changed, and the DVD's still freeze frame in the middle of the show and the DVD player unfreezes the frame by going back to the show's opening titles. What Gives?!   I have seen bare bones releases and second rate DVD's releases from other companies (most notely with Disney and Warners), but Universal also is rapidly joining the list of companies that corner the market with bad and defective DVD standards.  All I can do is stop watching Tv shows or movies made by Universal, because now it is more then likely that they will give them bad DVD releases that are not worth my time or money 
 I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable and because they looked like they were made of leather. They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not attractive.  They will be returned.    
 A lot has changed since this book was published in 1992. There are more up to date books availalbe. Buyer beware 
 If you are looking for a good story and character development, this movie dissapoints. The story is rather thin and slow with more focus on Joe's good looks. A irritatating aspect of the DVD was white flashes occuring at  innapropriate moments during the movie 
 I read The Real Lincoln once and was, in some regards, impressed with the number of sources and the style of writing.  Still, it bugged me because so much that I have read did not allow his pejoratives to ring true.  Therefore, I began investigating its sources in detail, one by one, before coming to a conclusion.  I have found that The Real Lincoln is one the slickest example of half truths, anachronisms, and unfair assaults I have ever read.  So incensed am I that I am preparing a book to counter Mr. DiLorenzo's disgraceful rewrite of history.    Obviously, I can't go into great length here, but let's look at two examples.  1) Several times DiLorenzo scathes Lincoln for ordering the arrest of Clement L. Vallandigham for making an anti-administration speech before Congress in August 1861.  That is false on two counts.  First, Ambrose Burnside alone was responsible for ordering Vallandigham's arrest, a fact well documented but not appearing in Mr. DiLorenzo's bibliography.  Lincoln knew nothing about the arrest order until it had been consummated.  Second, the event that led to the arrest was not Vallandigham's August 1861 speech to Congress but a May 1863 speech that he gave in Ohio.  All this appears several times in the Official Records and contemporaneous newspapers.    2) DiLorenzo cites a number of Republican newspapers that ostensibly criticized Lincoln's policies.  Except when you read the entire article (one from the New York Times, for example) you find exactly the OPPOSITE is true, that DiLorenzo only cited that portion of the article that paraphrased the opposition's thoughts, not subsequent paragraphs where they savaged Lincoln's opponents.  This happens in many other cases such as making historian David Herbert Donald appear to be on the DiLorenzo ticket of Lincolnism when full cites would have revealed something totally different.   Either Mr. DiLorenzo did not do his homework, or he is outright lying.  His obvious purpose is not providing a cogent look at Abraham Lincoln but beating the drum for his modern-day libertarian economic viewpoints.  Only the purest form of the Jeffersonian economic and political model matters to him, and any deviation from it is tantamount to tyranny.  While one may argue the point of minimal government interference, DiLorenzo blasts Lincoln with one pejorative after another and gives but lip service to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.  DiLorenzo even goes so far as to blame Lincoln for Reconstruction, as if the dead president were somehow able to lead events from the grave.  Radical Republicans are responsible for Reconstruction, and Lincoln was never a Radical Republican, much less a live one.  I could say much more, but it will have to wait for publication where I can expound at length.   The saddest part of this book is that too many believe this drivel. 
 This poorly laid out, badly written book claims to have covered both Regency and Victorian England, but really only covers Victorian.  Worse yet, it isn't always specific about what year it's covering, so it can be  confusing since the two time periods are so different.  If you're looking  for a good Regency reference, get What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens  Knew.  It's a better resource by ten fold!  If you're looking for an OK  Victorian reference, this might be the book for you 
 If you have already purchased the book "Eat Right 4 Your Type" you won't need this supplement as all the info is right there 
 If you want to learn poker stick with Sklanky, Harrington, and any other Two Plus Two book.  The first 70 pages of this book is literally nothing but hype about how good this system is (which it is not), then there are another 180 pages of small amounts of strategy (using the term loosely) mixed with antic dotes and other fluff.  There is a small amount of interesting info (in a clinical since) when the strategy is laid out, but basically the Kill Phil strategy is nearly worthless except maybe to be able to say that you made a great player fold a strong hand.  Unfortunately the KP strategy does not deal with the rest of the poker world who will be happy to call you with a crappy hand that is slightly better hand than the crap you just went all in with.  Bottom-line, this is a loosing strategy.  The one semi-redeeming quality of this book is that I do think the mentality of the Kill Phil Strategy is in the right place, be on the attack, push your advantage when you think you have the best of it, and don't be afraid to bust out 
 More tripe about how one "man" discovered other humans.  The "objective" view of this man as a hero is still present, helping to perpetuate the myth that Natives were not as valuable as the oppressors who came to colonize them.  I am not the type to say burn books, but this would make great kindling for the fires of truth.  You might be able to use it in a discussion of racism and the epestimologies that help create and foster it.  There are plenty of Italian people who were heroes, this person is just not one of them.  
 I dont normally slate films but this one was asking for it so bad. OMG- It saddens me to think the director got paid for this. Please someone- write & direct a good film for Van Damme- he deserves better than this.. 
 I'm dissapointed with the book as it does not give us enough information on holistic aspects of Tube Amp building as it contain too much of unnecessary basic information and pictures. I think it's good for an overview for valve amp building theory but not practical 
 not very helpful compared to the textbook I have. It has a lot of problems and worked out solutions sure, but not a whole lot on explaining the concepts behind them in words 
 Mr. Clark seems like a high energy, innovative soul who genuinely cares for his students.  The workbook, however, is disappointing.  It is mostly a compilation of busy work exercises.  One particular multiple-choice activity directs students to match a person with something he or she may have dropped.  I feel certain Mr. Clark's own role-playing activities (mentioned in his book The Essential 55) hold far more meaning and value for students.  Mr. Clark might better serve parents and teachers by providing suggestions, scenarios, and guidelines for managing those more memorable experiences.  
 I loved Gilad from watching him on ESPN and LOVE the beach scenes.  However, I felt like he went too fast; I was playing catch-up because he switched from one thing to another very quickly.  There weren't a lot of repeats before moving on to something new.  Maybe if I did it more and got used to it, I wouldn't mind.  However, I much prefer my Kathy Smith and Cathe videos.  This one is just collecting dust for me right now.  Maybe I'll give it a try another time, but I regret buying it 
 This book is a prolonged snivel about the pain of voluntarily going to places the author then found tacky, hostile or boring. By his own account he had not a moment's pleasure from his travels until he reached Hawaii, where it was all American and OK and Not Foreign. The only puzzle is why he did not at a much earlier stage of the trip get on a plane and go there direct; presumably he'd taken an advance from his publisher and had to deliver a book of some sort. The whole thing carries a moral for modern travellers: if you can't engage constructively with the places you go to, then please, please, stay at home - that way you'll be happier, the foreign people will be happier, and you won't needlessly contribute to airline CO2 emissions 
 ParasiteRex is an interesting book on all the types and varieties of parasites. That book I recommend.  This lady lists a few parasites and then preaches a great deal about 'God's organ' and 'Gods diet'...  'God wants you to eat this way...' etc.  I'm not quoting verbatim or course ha ha but you get the idea.  So I guess if you are Buddist or Muslim you better convert. She seems like a nutcase preacher not a scientist or even a good councelor. *and writes one dull read!*  I do believe in internal cleansing.  A product that I feel has worked well for me is at [...]: a total colon and parasite cleansing system.  Their ads make it all sound as if everyone has a weird experience, expelling large worms and going to the toilet 8 times a day but my experience was very normal. Might be the benefits are a placebo effect but what the heck..  I use their probiotics and digestive enzymes too.   Reading their website seems more informative than this book "Every body has parasites"  Do your self a favor and pass on this one.  ONe good thing:  it is really a tiny book and you can read it in about 20 minutes so if you choose to waste your money you won't be wasting much of your time.  
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking. No photos. It hurts the book 
 I had no knowledge and little confidence about my ability to create a web page. Just a desire.  This broke down the ends and outs of creating a web page and showed me just how easy it is. Unfortunately, it has my confidence soaring right now and now I believe I can get a job in the web page creation business but I know where my talents lie 
 This printing is missing 20 pages. I 've ordered 2 copies and both were defective 
 I have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on.  This action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in.  avoid like the plague 
 Please, if you want to waste your time and money buy this book. Sincerely, this book does not say anything valuable or new. There is a program (for free) RF-popHR made in 1998 that calculate these claimed kabalistic hours and you do not need the book for anything (I remark, for anything). The only thing you have to do is to adjust the hour playing with Time Zones in using a good ephemeris as Suncycle program (also shareware) 
 I read the first 20 pages of this snorer and couldn't continue. NOTHING happens! Why would I consider reading on? What's the first rule of writing a compelling novel? GRAB THE READER ON THE FIRST PAGE! This book never did. I'm not sure how people can rave about the great writing - it just isn't there 
 If you need a book to cure your insomnia...pick up August. It cured mine straightaway. No plot, ridiculous character, no humour, no suspense, no insights..nothing. It feels as if the author has recorded/eavesdropped some psycho babble at some psych clinic and transcribed it all down. Dawn the 'patient' has got to be the most aggravatingly uninteresting character...you as the reader cant care about her dreams, her lithographs, her childhood, her aunt, her boyfriends...in fact I even started resenting her appearance on the pages ... and skipped whole chapters devoted to to damnably boring Dawn. The only redemming feature of the book is the superb characterisation of Dr. Lulu Shinefield...especially when she is shown to be vulnerable in love...the insecurities of an ageing woman...but thats IT. Boring, its the paper version of a sleeping pil 
 Before taking a 4 hour train trip, I surveyed the pulp novels available at the news-stand.  I didn't want to make the mistake of picking up another book I would have to throw away in disgust 3 days later, like "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" or anything by that man-hating forensic anthropologist, what's-her-name.  So I went with "Bourne Ultimatum" as a safe bet, figuring, since I had seen "Identity" and "Supremacy" in the movie incarnations, and they were pretty good, this would be more of the same.    I was very wrong.  From the first few chapters, it became clear that the book was incoherent, repetitive, and its characters were laughably underdeveloped.  Later, huge holes in the plot began to appear, apparent lapses in reason and knowledge on the part of the author regarding their own material.  These seem to haunt many pulp novels, but nowhere is it more annoying.  Also, the author has the lazy habit of putting a lot of dialogue in italics to show emotion, rather than writing emotional dialogue.    This book has become almost unreadable, so it's going to the curb tomorrow.  I'm quitting on page 263.  I don't like or feel attached to any of the characters, and the plot has become a confusing spiral of contrivances.  I agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this book is a real slog to read; the opposite of a page-turner.  It's sad to see a trilogy that apparently started well, end like this.  You can guess from reading it that Ludlum, if he even wrote it, had no interest in the material, but had a contract to fulfill.              
 A friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday after someone else recommended it to her. We decided to read it with a group of friends, so then we could all see what it was about. Having just finished the book, I can say that I really did not enjoy reading it and had to force myself to finish it. The mix of Spanish and English may appeal to some, but to a non-Spanish speaker, it was more of a hindrance. The plot goes way off the deep end, and before there is any real character or plot development, the reader is suddenly overwhelmed with a major event, just a few pages into the book. Various details included in the story seemed rather useless and excessive, being tossed in and never brought up again, at least not in a major way. For example, the interruption of the plot to discuss the lesbian couple from Oakland was not much than that, just an interruption. The effect of these characters was so subtle that a few of my reading group friends didn't quite understand the reason for its inclusion in the book. In this example, the author seemed to lack the ability to tie it into the overall plot, merely hinting at the ramifications. However, actually bringing these minor details into the book may have been even worse, only because the book would have been longer then! If you're considering reading this "novel", I'd suggest you find a better, more well-written book to spend your time with instead 
 James Clavell's "King Rat" is hands down the worst of his Asian saga. Only related to the other four by the main character's possession of a "gold ring, signet of the Clan Gordon" (italics) mentioned once on the seventh page. Any reader of Clavell would expect this to have some significance later but the thread never reemerges. Did the author forget about it, carried away by his clearly sophmoric adulation of his Hero?  Or did he toss it in at his publisher's request in order to somehow justify this waste of print by weakly connecting it to his better works. And what is this shiftless down-and-out motherless drunkard's son doing with such a treasure anyway?  Surely that would have made a more interesting book. Of course, the matural answer is that Clavell is telling his own story, what he lived through as a POW. He has, however, forgotten the first rule of freshman exposition: "Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting."  Certainly, there are traces of the Clavell magic--despite his always hackneyed prose, he is a master storyteller, but in this case the threads lead nowhere and peter out where a quick death would be more merciful. A large theme is built up around a secret radio, but when discovered not once but twice the Japanese commander who has been built up as a terrifying menace offers cigarettes to all involved. None are tortured,jailed or even questioned.  It is as if he is uncertain as to whether he wants to write The Gulag Archipelago or Catch 22 and settle for Hogan's Heroes" (of TV sitcom fame).  Changi makes Stalak 13 look the Hanoi Hilton. There is even a Corporal Schwarz-like Japanese guard who, like his sitcom counterpart has "no stomach for war" and comes close to saying "I know nothing-Nothing!"  Clavell,who knows how to spin yarn, would be great on a campout and we cannot forget the majestic sweep of his four ?good? books, but, like the t-shirt says, "I spent nearly four years in a Japanese POW camp and all could come up with was this lame book. I was going to give the book away but instead chucked into the recycle bin. 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 The book contains 25 designs.  Many of these are pointless tile patterns.  Most figures are standard designs - you join 2 post-its to make your starting square paper. A number of designs would require an explanation for a viewer to recognise what they are suppposed to be. When I ordered the book I expected I would end up with lovely little figures across my desk cleverly folded from post-its - there wasn't one figure I would display. Don't bother with this book - there are plenty better - even free stuff off the web is higher standard 
 I seldomly fail to complete a novel of intrigue. I tried to remain patient  hoping that something would develop that captured my imagination but  nothing did.  I put the book back on the bookshelf without completing it 
 This book is most useful if one wishes to study Walter Kaufmann.  This book is a waste of time if you wish to study the writers Kaufmann presents to us.  Kaufmann warps the texts to suit his own agenda.  If you share his agenda you will likely not even notice that he has an agenda.  "If you make people think they are thinking they will love you, but if you really make them think they will kill you. " - Albert Einstein  
 Examples are few and offer little explaination. I find this book so hard to follow.  On a good note: algorithms are clear 
 Ugh!  This book was a gift, so of course I read it.  Don't waste your time! I read it a year ago and it still sticks in my head as one of the worst books I have read in quite some time.  
 I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first.  But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.    My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda.  The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught 
 What do you do when you have written a really great two-book series full of galactic destruction and adventure?  If you're John Vornholt, you churn out a third book as a sequel to them (granted, it may very well have been the publisher's idea, but he could always have said no).  Genesis Wave: Book 3 is everything that the first two books weren't:  boring, plodding, with bad characterization and large stretches where nothing interesting happens.  It is not only entirely forgettable, but it's also inconsequential.  The Genesis threat has been neutralized with the help of the Romulans and almost the entirety of Starfleet.  However, the problems are not over.  While the cleanup begins, the Enterprise discovers that the Genesis Wave has weakened the boundaries between our universe and another one, allowing horrifying creatures to bridge the gap.  A massive rip in space does not bode well for the Federation's survival, especially because this isn't the only rift out there.  Meanwhile, on a backwater mining planet, a Bajoran Prylar (similar to a lower-level priest or monk) is given what turns out to be a portable Genesis device.  Believing it to be the Orb of Life, he is determined to use it for the good of his people, no matter what the true consequences will be.  Aided by a Ferengi, a few Bajorans, and an enigmatic Vulcan, this Prylar could very well cause a lot more suffering than he thinks he will cure.  But will the Romulans kill anybody they have to in order to get a hold of this final device?  It's almost hard to begin, there is so much wrong with this.  First, the characterization is way off.  Weird romance passages abound (Vornholt seems to have been bitten by the Christie Golden bug, as he describes many characters as "stunning") and even when the romance angles are a bit more understandable, they are stilted an obvious.  One of Crusher's patients falls in love with her, but Crusher is acting like a jealous fishwife because of the way Picard is acting with the Romulan commander on the other ship.  Picard's actions are made clear later in the book, but Crusher's are never really explained.  In all their years of working together, they have been attracted to each other, but she's never acted this way.  This book takes place between Insurrection and Nemesis, and there's no hint in either one of these movies that would allow for Crusher to act like she does in this book.  Troi and Riker aren't nearly as bad, but some of their scenes together really grated on my nerves as well.  There are times where they don't act like the professionals they are.  Even Vornholt's characters are not immune to this.  The Romulan commander has a hold on Picard's emotions (I won't say how, for fear of spoiling) but, for some reason, she has a scene where she tells the sleeping Picard that she really loves him.  It's never referred to again.  The rest of the book introduces characters that I, for the most part, cared nothing about.  The book seems to be a showcase for a new series that never actually started, of "Genesis Warriors," or at least warriors who banded together to fight the Genesis threat.  There's the Vulcan priestess, the Romulan who has a secret, the defected Romulan who is a Starfleet admiral's agent, a Ferengi, and a shape-shifter (not a Founder).  Sounds like a super-hero team, in a way, even down to them having a strong leader who gives them missions in Admiral Nechayev.  My first understanding was that Genesis Force would be their first (and last) adventure, but I recently discovered that Genesis Force takes place concurrently with this three-book series, so that's not true.  Even so, it does look like the "premiere issue," even going so far as to really ignore the Enterprise crew for long periods at a time.  Then there's the completely unnecessary references to Vornholt's Gemworld TNG series of books.  The characters (especially Troi) keep wondering if the rift is something similar to what happened on Gemworld.  It's never definitively answered (and if so, I was so bored I missed it) and even if it was answered, it really had no bearing on the plot.  If there's anything I hate more than the overuse of continuity, it's the overuse of *useless* continuity.  Vornholt at least doesn't take large portions of the book to explain what happened on Gemworld, but he comes close.  Another use of continuity I had to laugh at is what ends up being the Romulan plan (and I shall say no more in fear of spoilage).    Other strangeness abounds as well.  The entire Picard plot thread, though clear to the reader before this happens, is revealed to the characters in about two sentences as soon as Nechayev boards the Enterprise in a completely anti-climactic moment that allows them to plan a commando mission on to the Romulan ship.  The best thing I can say about the book is that the atmosphere is pretty well done.  The excavation of the lab on Lomar, where all of the dead and dying bodies taken over by the moss creatures in the previous books reside, is quite chilling and oppressive at times, mirroring exactly how it would feel to work in that environment.  Other than a few odd moments here and there (like Lomar), I had to really struggle with this book.  It reads very quickly, just like the first two books do, but yet it's also a struggle to get through as you the plot gets more and more outlandish.  The worst thing is that this book was *completely* unnecessary!  The first two books were so good, but this one almost cheapens them.  I say almost, because thankfully this book is not necessary for the enjoyment of those two.  It can be completely ignored, and probably should be.  David Ro 
 As a young teenager,i enjoyed the Doors' philosophical pop-tunes on birth,life and death.In 1998,i was departing a flight ,from Munich to O'Hare,and noticed a passanger's rucksack ,on the strap-handle.It was signed by Robby Krieger.Their influence is global and contemporary.All their albums are still great.Back in 1985,i had discovered this paperback on Jim and the Doors.I think the authors were trying to tap into the spirit of JM and relay it to the reading public.The writing is rather weak and puerile.Well,i felt that a media-shaped picture was presented,and not the overall real portrait of Jim and Pamela.It gives no solid historical background,no psychological insight or current info ,on the whole rock group either.It's a flippy,dippy,hippie look at the whole experience. What did amaze me,was that Jim was able to take a novelist's or philosopher's thoughts ,and channel their energies and writings into some rather catchy top-ten rock songs.Eventhough Jim,like so many other young 60's people,was just vocally responding to the swift social changes occuring before their very eyes.There is no discussion about Jim being a modern shaman,trapped in the Western Christian world.This is sadly considered thee definitive book on the Morrison & the Doors.I love Oliver Stone's movies,except one. Oliver Stone's 'Doors' flick ,shows a flippy-dippy drunken-sailor Morrison ,meandering the stygian flow of the music and a ridiculous view of the wiccan hand-fasting.Everyone who knew Jim personally ,panned the film. A better book and an even better movie can still be produced. Update:Check out the book,"The Doors by the Doors",by Ben Fong Torres 
 Be warned - this book is over 600 pages long and every character is a talking cadaver.  Yes, there are seven narrators, but, as many critics have noted, their voices meld into one - this lack of differentiation undermines the basic intent of the novel. Instead of being in the company of seven different characters, I felt I was in the company of a single person, the author - and he wasn't feeling that great.  The book reads as a dreary confession, one that would have any self-respecting psychiatrist reaching for his prescription pad.   * There is far less ambiguity here than you might imagine, and in more ways than one.  A change in perspective never overturns any basic fact about the plot or, more surprisingly, regarding a character's motivations - rather than being akin to Rashomon, where each view radically conflicts with its neighbour, here the narrators simply take turns telling the same undisputed story.  This lack of conflict between their vantages leads to a lack of tension; and in itself deprives the voices of individuality.  Yes, one character can see things which another can't, but it's more a case of adding to the overall picture, instead of actually angrily erasing and painting over the space.   * The rhythm of the sentences varies little from chapter to chapter.  This is not Faulkner.  The vocabulary is similarly uniform (as an example, "perfunctory" and "insensate" are used by Angela, while for Joe it's "obfuscate" - these being the two allegedly less educated characters).  The characters all achieve a similar level of insight into, and reflection upon, themselves. Perhaps most disappointing is the chapter voiced by Simon, the literary minded precipitant of events.  For all his alleged passion for poetry, his writing is bland and his references to literature rather limited - his voice does not breathe life into the bones of his character.  The dialogue is poorly written - in most chapters it would be difficult to tell who is speaking without prompts, and the overall tone is awkward and dead; perhaps the Dennis Mitchell chapter escapes this criticism. * The two prime female characters are drawn as stereotypically beautiful.  We are carefully informed about the size of their breasts, and the allure of their eyes.  In intellectual matters, they respectfully defer to their male superiors, be this the soulful stuff of art, or the technicalities of card-counting in blackjack.  Yawn.  There's not much evident irony in Perlman's choice of such representations.  When Anna reveals that: "He played me like a musical instrument", I had to check the cover to make I sure I wasn't reading Judith Krantz.  If parts of the book read with the flattened affect of an airport novel it could be because his characters, and his handling of them, share many qualities.  Then there's is the central issue of Simon's obsession with Anna - the narcissism inherent in this is impressive, but its exploration is limited - it might be raising the standard too high, but Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' shows how multi-faceted such an exploration can be. * Perhaps, more than reading the book itself, it's interesting to ask why so many people found it so stimulating.  The very flatness of the style does make it easy to read.  The attempt to begin a meditation on character by invoking childhood influences, adult relationships, and unpredictable events, is, as everyone says, ambitious.  It could be that the analysis proceeds at a depth which is comfortable for most readers - it allows fractions of honesty to become visible, while a veil remains over much.  Of course, fractions can add up to a sizeable sum.  My overall reaction to the book was negative, and reminded me of the mood created by reading books by Richard Powers - both authors construct plots which shape a superficial interest, and pen characters with surface complexities, but the crucial insight required for true empathy to be established is missing, as is a winning sense of humour.  At best this is a novel I might admire, but not one that I could love 
 This book was entertaining like a blockbuster movie- a pageturner. But I am horrified that people ignorant about Islam are getting their "information" from such an inaccurate and inflammatory source. 
 I find that Michael Moore in his films often pushes the envelope on fair-play and reality and I sometimes question his methods.  When I ordered this movie, I thought it might be a humorous lambasting of Moore's films pointing out any crucial mistakes he made in presenting his case.  But there was little humor in Michael Wilson's film, just attacks.  Instead of showing where Moore screwed up, it tried to use a variation of the same tactics Moore uses to unsuccessfully prove its point.  If the purpose of this film is to show that Michael Moore hates America, then it falls far short of its goal.  First of all, Michael Wilson's film offers nothing to contradict any of the allegations made by Michael Moore in his films and books.  He only attacks Michael Moore, but not what he has to say.  He did try using a statistic to refute the "Bowling for Columbine" movie, but he only mentioned the small part of the total study that seemed to support his claim.  Wilson stated that statistically, Canada (a country with strict gun laws) has twice as much crime per capita as the US.  What he fails to tell you is that most of this crime is property crime - stealing stuff.  I'm not worried about getting shot by a petty thief or hit by a stray bullet during a turf war between rival factions of vicious shoplifting gangs.  If you look at the entire study, you'll see that what Mr. Wilson did not mention was that even though Canada had more overall crime than the US, the US has SIX TIMES as much VIOLENT CRIME as Canada.  You know, the kind of crime someone often commits with a GUN.  So, if one researches the one "fact" Mr. Wilson did bring up in his film, you'll find that it only supports Michael Moore and "Bowling for Columbine".  He would have been better off using the ideas of "Freakonomics", which paint a slightly different, but very logical, picture of gun control.  Even when Michael Moore annoys me, he still entertains me.  The humor in his films is obvious.  Yes, he is frequently over the top with his attacks, his often-overbearing personality, but it's still funny.  You can always detect the twinkle in his eye.  Wilson just attacks; no real humor here.  Moore is like a big, friendly dog that wants to play, but knocks you down with his enthusiasm - annoying, but fun.  Wilson is more like a pit bull, going straight for the jugular with no mercy - scary and dangerous.  He tried to be funny a couple times, but fell short of the joke.  His film is just a mean-spirited attack on Michael Moore.  The people Wilson interviews all obviously hate Moore for being who he is.  They remind me of all the other Michael Moore haters who write books and articles about him.  There are attacks on his weight, attacks on his often-slovenly appearance, but no real proof that most of what he says is not the truth.  If you read Jamie Whyte's book "Crimes Against Logic" you'll understand why attacking the messenger does nothing to negate the message.  That, to me, is the problem with the many books and videos out there which attack Michael Moore's work - they attack the person not the content.  I read that Moore was very careful to not screw up any of the facts in "Fahrenheit 911" to avoid similar criticisms as he got for "Bowling for Columbine".  So, while the critics don't like Moore for being fat, pushy, and annoying, they cannot refute any of the claims made by him in his movies and books.  From that I would have to conclude that even though Moore's tactics are difficult to accept, what he is trying to say must be true.    If that is the case, then it is obvious that Michael Moore does not hate America.  He loves his country as much or more than anyone living here.  This becomes obvious by watching "Fahrenheit 911" - one of the most patriotic films I've seen recently.  He just doesn't want to see our country destroyed by the people with the guns and money, the people who are getting richer and richer while the middle class shrinks and the lower class swells.  It is those people he is attacking, not America.  People like Mr. Wilson either cannot see that or, for whatever reason, are turning a blind eye to this obvious change in our country.  We are ALL Americans, not just the rich CEOs.  We are all hoping to live the American dream.  They are trying to steal the American dream.  Michael Moore is just pointing this out. 
 I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring.  We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless. 
 This book would make a perfect gift for the wanna be intelligent idiot in your family.    Theodor Adorno use his overly complex prose to dance about linguistically and make big intelligent sounding noises. It's sure to impress anyone looking for something deep SOUNDING.  "In its absurd readiness to accept these, impotently prostrate humanity tries desperately to assimilate to experience what defies all experience"  You see?  Movies are bad.  Almost all reality changing ideas can be said with common language. So what is the purpose of this book?  Me thinks it amounts to simple written [...].    I actually burst out laughing more than a few times while reading this.   Or in the style of Mr. Adorno...   "Whereas the blank page speaks none so much as a latent novelist who has bequeathed his mightiest thoughts, so does flooding of pages with equally blank ink. This dark coloring arranged and thoroughly thought out as to light a question unto the reader in such a manner as to ask "what is the purpose of the unnecessary prose?  Thus, laughter develops, envelops and utterly denies the its intended purpose.  Namely, the communication of ideas."  Sadly, I have a feeling many literary snobs and ego-maniacs will fall for Mr. Adorno's slight-of-language tricks.   Great thoughts are best disseminated though common language.  Don't let his complex packaging fool you.  There isn't much inside.  Try reading Mises/Hazlat/Rockwell and co... 
 the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes.  I have used it about three or four times and I don't feel it will last much longer. What there was of it seemed to work well, but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use. 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 I am always looking for quality nutricious treats for my teens. I bought the samplers to see if anyone had a favorite. Sorry to say that we just did not like any of these. A little too spicy and we were looking for crunch and got chewy. 
 As a person who used to see Pat Green in Texas on a regular basis I am very sad to witness this progression everyone talks about.  There are close to 100 bland country singers belting out the "Nashville" sound.  Where songs are written in a cubicle on music row.  Pat Green has morphed into Kenny Chesney with sleeves on his shirt (thank god!).  Lets hope Pat Green takes a trip back to Gruene Hall and gets back in touch with the sound that made him a legend in Texas 
 Looks nice, but remember this is an inexpensive toy.  So the stamped steel pieces and hardware show their "Made in China" origins.  Front wheel is not true (straight), thereby making aligning the handlebars with the front fender and wheel impossible.  Very aggravating.  So handlebars are now straight in reference to the frame, but the front wheel tilts over a tiny bit, and the front fender sits crooked.  And that's the best compromise.  Paint seems nice, though 
 I have bought and returned three of these units now. Each one has been defective, and finally I just gave up on returning the system. The DVD player constantly gives "Bad Disc" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc. The sound quality is very nice for the price, but since the player doesn't work, it's essentially useless. This is a complete rip-off at any price point 
 Upon hearing this record you would think the Appleseed Cast had been listening only to their own records for the past years.  Peregrine essentially repeats the appleseed cast formula of enigmatic lyrics over delay laden mellow guitar riffs and uneven drum rythms.The vocals are as usual buried somewhere behind the mix.Then the song rocks out at the end.Repeat.  This would all be good and well,except this is not their first or second record.I used to really like them,but these days I'm honestly getting tired of them.The mid-nineties were a long time ago after all.  Here and there the band ventures into the usual semi-electronic experimentation.They also made sure this record didn't sound as good or as polished as the last one,beacause we all know polished,well recorded albums are evil.  No,better to record half the album in a basement somewhere,and eventually mush it all up in a sonic salad of distorted guitars,overcompressed drums,"ambient" sounds and synths.Oh,and let's not forget the random sampled radio in the background.Very new.Very experimental.  And what would an AC album be without the mellow rock instrumentals?Yeah,those are there as well.  Needless to say,a lot of people are going to feel very intelligent for liking this record,but if you've known the band for some time,believe you me,you've seen it all before 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.  If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.  If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot 
 I bought the book in the airport and started reading it during the 8 hours flight. I could not believe that such an uninteresting and painfully slow paced novel was a bestseller...I forced myself through the first 30 pages...but that was it. I just left it in the airplane.Maybe later got more interesting,I woudn't know that. But what I read was just plain awafull. Now that I look at the amazon's reviews...they are not so bad......makes me very cautious about reviews in the futur 
 Charity is income redistribution without results.  Ask yourself: what does charity typically go to?  It typically goes to feed and clothe people. Ten dollars given to charity, e.g., may help a homeless person get a meal for a couple of days, but does it get them a home?  No, it helps them be more comfortable, last a bit longer, in their deprived state.  In fact, charity, because it may help to mask the severity of our social problems, does the opposite of real change.  Liberals are typically interested in seeing real change: a change in society's values such that charity is no longer a necessity.  This is not "income redistribution" but social change.    I am not saying that charity is wrong or immoral, just that emphasizing it over real social change reflects a certain picture of priorities: i.e. to make people more comfortable with the satus quo.  Liberals tend to look to the future, whereas conservatives tend to look for immediate rewards (like tax breaks).  A real sacrifice is one that benefits future generations (our children).    Look into Mr. Brooks' background.  He is neither innocent nor objective.  This is a book with a secret agenda.  Its agenda has a lot to do with O'Reilly's war on the SP's.  Religion is touted as the answer to everything.  If all people were just religious...  Most are.  See where we're at?    Anyway, is giving in order to be rewarded with heaven really "charity"?  Wouldn't that be the reverse of selflessness 
 Judging by the long reviews before me, it should be obvious that there is much to say about Calvin's theology.  This book doesn't say too much.  For those familiar with his theology, DON'T buy this book.  It will be a waste of your money.  For those who would like to know more about Calvin's theology, without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology, buy this.  If you want a good in depth coverage of Calvin's theology, buy the FULL version and enjoy 
 I own the other three Kosher By Design cookbooks and love them, so I expected to be wowed by this one as well. I was very disappointed. I appreciate the fact that this cookbook is intended to make quick recipes, but I dislike the fact that Fishbein utilizes so many prepared ingredients (salad dressings, accompanying sauces, etc). This cookbook fits more into the Rachael Ray concept than the Susie Fishbein concept to which I've become accustomed. If you like that, you'll enjoy this book, but it wasn't for me. 
 Wow, I can't believe any parent would advocate this book, and I can't believe this guy is a doctor... Wow! He literally ignores every study done in the world about corporal punishment. It's really sick. He can justify his sickness with Biblical quotes which is even sicker. 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 Despite the reviews, I don't connect with this book. It had nothing memorable. Sorry, it's going to get donated to the local library 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 Well, they say that you get what you pay for.  That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less!  If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine.  If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this.  Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board.  Several pieces arrived damaged.  We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it.  If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart.  Also, the drawers are very shallow.  Don't expect to store much in this.  It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it 
 This small fan is quite powerful but extremely loud. As far as moving air, it's great.  But, it's sound is distracting even on the lowest of four speeds and on high it dominates the room.  Also, the remote should include the oscillate function.  Had I been aware of the loudness of the unit I would have looked for a quieter fan 
 honestly, i hate my teacher for assinging this book to read. the plot is the most boring, stupid thing i have ever read! why on earth are people giving this book 5 stars?! IT DOESNT DESERVE EVEN ONE! i found myself loosing focus and daydreaming, ecspeacially during the end. this book was a drag. i'm glad my teacher only gave us two weeks to read it, that way i only had to skim those horrible pages 
 Some background, I grew up in Beijing and attended good schools just like her, and I am much older than her. The point? She has no experience whatsoever - everything she wrote about the past was from wild imaginations, almost anything related to Mao and communists was far from the truth.   The worst part of the book is the deep brown-nosed kissing the American *** in the expense of demonizing her own and my home country, China. America this and America that. As if once you come to America, everything would be immediately nice and dandy. The fact is if you cannot thrive in China, you cannot thrive in America either. Why? Because in China, you can at least rely on your parents and relatives, but in America, you must fight all the way by youself, not to mention there's Green Card issue and many foreigners have been forced to leave America because of it.   The worst part is:  "If you grew up in a language that you never used to express your feelings, it would be easier to take another language (English, of course) and talk more in the new language. It makes you a new person." - A Thousand Year's Good Prayer  I don't know which part of China or earth she's from, but hell, I have no problem expressing my feelings either in Chinese or English. It does not matter we are talking about feelings, politics or philosophy.   To me, she got a big brown nose, which makes her writting really bad.  I gave it two stars just because she's a chinese and willing to try to write in English.  The only $ I wasted so far on Amazon 
 Must write a review so I may save someone else from a sleepless night. Sheets were washed and still felt like sandpaper. I literally had to sleep in the guest room. I guess the old saying "you get what you pay for" applied. If you are used to nice sheets, you will hate these.  The  egyptian label is very misleading. It only take 1% egyptian cotton thread to qualify sheets as such. Watch to be sure that you are buying 100% egyptian. Given this from a sheet supplier, but good food for thought. [... 
 This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts.  Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought.  Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel 
 The CD does not work in either my CD player of in my computer 
 I purchased this book about a year ago while I was 5 months pregnant with my twin boys.  Immediately I discovered that many of the views were a bit outdated.  It is very evident that it was written before twins and multiples were as common as they are now.  Many of the concerns (doctor's offices, shopping, travel) discussed are simply not an issue any more. Most pediatrician offices are very well equipped and able to handle twin visits.  Nearly all grocery stores have those awesome shopping carts with infant seats already attached (a push/pull of two carts isn't that hard).  And as far as getting around, there are literally dozens of twin and triplet strollers available now.    I found the book to consistently present the worst of every situation. From clothes, to bathing and feeding nearly all the parents seem overwhelmed and frustrated.  It really isn't like that! My boys are 7 months old now and I can honestly say... raising them has been nothing like it seemed in this book.   I say, find a more a recently written book and one that is based here in the US if you live here.  The cultural differences and new commoness of multiples really make for a big difference.    Enjoy your babies, and relax! My twin theory is this:  Whatever you just did... You just do it again. 
 DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE!  This mouse has given me nothing but frustration.  1. The front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low, causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time.  2. Battery life is horrible. Like 2 weeks...  3. When your mouse is idle for 8 minutes, it goes into an automatic sleep mode. The manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to "revive" it but when I do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen. So I have to reboot my computer.  Absolutely the worst!! 
 As other reviews have said that the author does not spell out the specific language needed for deals.  That is because they want you to sign up for their Real Estate Seminars.  Stay away from Peter Conti and his company.  I have had a very bad experience with them and do not recommend 
  I find it fascinating how often members of both sides of the evolution-creation argument accuse each other of some kind of questionable practice - whilst doing exactly the same thing themselves.  The credibility of this book can be gauged right from the start of the first chapter - by the arguments presented by an evolutionist who is pulling exactly the kind of stunts that evolutionists most hate (and quite reasonably so) when such actions are being carried out by creationists.  First the author uses a passage from the work of Henry Morris as though it faithfully represented the views of ALL those who prefer a creationist explanation of the origins of mankind.  Secondly the author fails to distinguish between "fundamentalist", "creationist" and "literalist", drawing the assumption, for example, that all fundamentalists are literalists as far as interpreting the contents of the Bible is concerned. This is categorically NOT true - as illustrated all the way back in 1925 when William Jennings Bryan (a renowned fundamentalist but NOT a literalist) explained, in the course of the trial of John Scopes, that he believed in the literal truth of the Bible, but ONLY insofar as it was meant to be taken literally.  Next the author makes an unjustified leap - from saying that evolutionism (from a creationist viewpoint) "may be because of the Devil" (page 1) to the extremist claim that "scientific creationism" is seen by its adherents as "a battle between Good and Evil" and that "either you are for God, or on the side of the Devil" (page 2).  So, in the space of just about one full page of text, the author selected to "open the batting" has indulged in the three cardinal sins so often ascribed to creationists:   - Quote mining  - Misuse of technical terms  - Building straw men as a basis for repudiating the case made by the people you are criticising.  Please note, I am not for one moment denying that "some" creationists may be in complete agreement with Dr. Morris' views; "some" creationists definitely do indulge in quote mining; "some" creationists do misuse (deliberately or through ignorance) technical terms and definitions relating to evolution; and "some" creationists definitely do base their arguments on "straw men" because they are so much easier to demolish than confronting the "facts".  But NOT all of them. Contrary to the implication made by this author, and throughout most of the book, creationists are a diverse lot and definitely not a neatly self-contained, homogenous group which can be written off with a few supercilious side swipes. Nor is it true that ONLY "scientific creationists" (or any other religion-oriented groups/individuals) have criticisms of the supposedly "scientific" evidence used to support evolutionist claims.  (See, for example, "Shattering the Myths of Darwinism", by Richard Milton, a science journalist and evolutionist with NO religious affiliations.)  In a nutshell, "Scientists Confronting Creationism" is preaching strictly to the "converted" whilst adding little or nothing to a genuinely informed and useful debate.  
 This book was a big disappointment. I'm sorry I bought it, and I'm not keeping it. HIGH ALTITUDE BAKING (Colorado Extension Service) and PIE IN THE SKY (Susan Purdy) cookbooks are much better 
 Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham.  He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph.  Very preachy about the plight of the homeless.  I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all 
 This book is junk.   Now this is as blanket-ish and opinionated a statement as the content of this book generally is.   I was looking to learn more about finishing and I thought that a book with that kind of title would be the one for me. Instead, it should be called "my point of view on finishing". The author just spends pages explaining how every other woodworker (people who actually make furniture) is absolutely wrong, going as far as mostly saying that woodworkers who write books have been spreading lies (talk about sawing the plank you're standing on...).   This book is just a piece of opinion and certainly not what someone looking for an objective guide needs. The author also contradicts himself several times such as saying that woodworkers of old didn't favor linseed oil (offering, as a proof, that it is not mentioned in accounting records.........) to then say, several chapters later, that it is what they often used. I believe that it is at that point that I decided to be done with the whole book, and I''d take it back if I had bought it locally.  Also, it is clear that the author cares only about the finish, and not the crafted piece of furniture that iit is applied to. Read only if you share the author's point of view that the only worthwhile finishes are lackers and such things that woodworking and craftsmen all over the world would say create a plastic and fake looking result, or if your only goal is to make the wood look like a mirror.  There are many other authors that touch on finishing in their woodworking books and speak more of their experience than their opinion or prejudice, and are a much better read. This is so opinionated and biased that is has no credibility in my mind.  Don't waste your money on this 
 I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours. 
 This is the weakest volume in the 25-volume set. Rhino either lost their enthusiasm for the project on this one or ran out of money to purchase song rights. Several hits from this era would have added weight to this volume,  and would have matched the earlier spirit of the project. How about  "Reminiscing" by Little River Band? "Children of the  Sun" by Billy Thorpe? And, a song that is referred to numerous times  in liner notes of previous volumes -- "Baker Street" by Gerry  Rafferty? Rhino rallies a bit in Vol. 25, but this one is a stinker. Most  of these songs were marginal hits, and you'll understand why when you hear  them 
 a friend of mine recommended this book a while ago and i decided to give it a try. what a waste of time! after a so-so start it dissolves into a silly, improbable, absolutely unbelievable mess, the conclusion being particularly stupid  and unrealistic. if you want to do yourself a favour, stay with patricia highsmith instead 
 This book is really boring.  It's language is confusing, its references to other obscure pieces of literature are too complex, and it just really stinks 
 This book asumes you are already a programmer. There is no explaination of how to but rather a look at some API's out there. If you do not already know how to work with API's you will be lost. Of course if you already knew how to work with API in PHP you wouldnt have bought the book 
 there was very little information on flower seeds, nor much in depth  information 
 This is just a PR piece for the Disney company, a way to build hype so more people will buy their products and see their shows.  I was hoping for some nuts & bolts advice on designing theme parks and theme park rides.  Everybody knows how to brainstorm;  everybody knows the importance of color and lighting and music;  everybody models on computers before they make physical models.  What do Imagineers do that's different?  Do they have special techniques for brainstorming, or for choosing colors, or stage lighting?  The answers are not here.  Also, what have Imagineers learned from their mistakes?  If you take this book at face value, Imagineers have never made mistakes;  everything they've done is perfect, and any criticism leveled at Walt Disney world was later retracted or countered 
 I gave a one star to this item only because I couldn't give a lower rating than that. The image quality is very very bad. We decided to return it in just the first half hour we started using it. It doesn't work properly with yahoo messenger and the image quality is very bad in skype 
 SIGHTS UNSEEN, a short novel by Kaye Gibbons, tells the story of a woman named Maggie Barnes with bipolar disorder, told through her daughter, Hattie's, eyes.  Hattie, writing from the perspective of the woman she's become, relates the events that happened to her mother, specifically those events that took place during Hattie's twelfth year, in 1963, when Maggie, between bouts of sex-crazed mania and suicidal depression, ran into a woman with a car and was sent to Duke for electroconvulsive shock therapy that was meant "cure" her.  The strength of the novel is in Kaye Gibbons' sensitivity to the severity of manic depression and what it's like for someone who has to live with bouts of extreme joy and severe sadness.  However, if you're looking for some kind of insight from Hattie in this novel, you won't find it.  Hattie is a completely impersonal narrator; it's easy to forget that she is Maggie's daughter.  She seems so disconnected from the story and the events that are happening.  The reader gets no insight into Hattie's hopes or fears--we don't know how she feels about growing up without a reliable mother; it's almost as if Gibbons deliberately skirts Hattie's feelings in order to talk more about her mother's antics.  There is a brief suggestion that Hattie desperately desires her mother's attention, but it is not fully developed, and is therefore unbelievable.  The novel has potential--but, because of Hattie's failure as a narrator, it falls short of the goal Gibbons probably imagined it would attain 
 Seems to concentrate heavily on the gay and lesbian aspects of SF.  My wife and I found Eyewitness Travel Guides' San Francisco and Northern California to be much more useful for planning our trip there 
 Sound quality is good but I really don't like the style...It is smaller than you'd expect it to be, because the image shown is not the actual size of the mp3 player. The reaction time between when you press the buttons and the display on the screen is ehh a bit slow I'd say...I just always happen to pass the song. I'd much rather buy an iPod but have heard it is not the most reliable thing ever. But I know for a fact that iPods are very quick, unlike this mp3 player. I'm shopping for a new mp3 player around $50 but have found no luck in getting a sleek styled and reliable one. I guess I'll just have to wait for the prices of the iPods to lower. I do not trust pre-owned iPods or any electronic pre-owned items, you never know how the previous owner treated the item before selling it online. Also, this mp3 player has only two colors really, silver and white. The earphones gave too much of a loud surround sound which I really disliked, so I used the earphones from my previous SanDisk mp3 player. Okay...so maybe this mp3 player doesn't really have that many problems, but these are just my preferences and I just don't like the overall appearance of it. Many of my friends have iPods and they work well...no problems yet, so I guess they're pretty reliable. Also, the battery on the mp3 goes quickly...if you are going on a long trip, I suggest you have an extra one or two batteries with you. I constantly have to check to see how much battery life is left on my mp3 display screen. I really DO NOT recommend buying this mp3 player if you are a teen like me, because you will regret it. I have found the style of this mp3 to be extremely unappealing a while after I bought it...as time went on I started to dislike it more and more. As soon as the prices of iPods lower, I'm definitely buying one. I...like many teens look for mostly a sleek style that iPods offer and of course reliablility...after all, it can be very fustrating time after time of having to buy a new mp3 player because of how unreliable it is 
 Rochester has such a talent for grating tone that I hated to agree with him, even when he was being reasonable.  Luckily, that case didn't come up all that often.  Sometimes he had sound notions -- of course it's not reasonable to have a sixth grader do a math assignment that's an essay about his/her "favorite number."  But he needlessly denigrates concepts like teaching for multiple talents and writing to different genres/audiences, arguing as though the abuse of these concepts invalidated them entirely.  His attempts at joviality are also forced, often rude, and all too frequent.  And despite his opening claims to liberalism, he makes claims like, "It was obvious that, in his rush to fairness, the principal had substituted racial quotas and other counting-by-the-numbers for merit."  Leaving aside the question of what else one would count by, if not the numbers, the situation as he presents it is not at all *obviously* racially motivated, and the basic assumption that it *must* be hardly seems to fit any kind of liberal -- *or* the kind of logical rigor he champions for students.  This book was more sensationalistic than useful 
 The buyer must be informed that this work is a mere pamphlet, containing barely twelve pages, five of which are the composed of the introduction.  It also should be noted that the obscure Christian mystic St Dionysius the Areopagite's work the "Mystical Theology" contained here is essentially useless without the rest of his body of writings; it is difficult to get an idea of the whole with only a part of this sage's theology.  So for anyone seeking to find a comprehensive view of St Dionysius the Areopagite's theology in a single volume they definitely should not look here.  Instead check out Colm Luibheid's "Pseudo Dionysius: The Complete Works" (Classics of Western Spirituality) for a full-scale treatment of his theology 
 This sheet is cheap, ugly, and scratchy.  Instead, buy a portable crib sheet, they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors.  They are softer and more durable 
 This is an earnest if clumsily written book about redemption and believing in yourself.  The dialogue is wooden and the characters are completely one dimensional.  The author is trying to make a statement about caring for the environment, but it just ends up to be preachy and pedantic.  There are far better young adult fantasy series on the market, and I would not recommend this one 
 I love America, but this could be the worst Christmas CD I have ever heard! Do not waste your money. It is a joke. They try to work some of the guitar riffs from some of their classics into the songs, SHAMEFULL! Terrible, terrible, awful 
 This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless 
 Although I enjoy the stories in this book, and am interested in the subject matter, I find the book almost impossible to read.  Every sentence ends in an exclamation point-it is so manic!  manic! manic!  I haven't been able to finish it-I can only take it in small doses because while I read it it seems as though everyone is screaming and breathless (which, who knows, they may have been-after all it was on a ship in a storm).  Just a little hard to read, but very interesting 
 I have read all of Michael Connelly's books and have enjoyed them all....until this one.  It is so unbelievable I can hardly believe it was written by Connelly.  Skip this one but read the others 
 Beware - there are NO recipes for pizza, bread and muffins in this cookbook as pictured on the cover 
 I think that this story has been told before and been told better. I did not enjoy it 
 This book is pretty amusing.  Every time you read ad hominum attacks, such as those in this silly book, you realize how unsophisticated the writers are.  Even more unsophisticated: dedicating a book to someone you hate!  Now that's scholarship!  Also amusing are the reviewers who spew hatred -- you really have to get a life!  If your self-esteem was solid, you wouldn't be such a crybaby.  Boo hoo. 
 I bought this with the intent in mind of seeing step by step house painting instructions. What I received was a DVD with allot of talk on "how to do"  certain painting exercises but the "hosts" did not conclude or follow thru to a logical end. Lacks thorough demonstrations for the novice to really "apply", translate this to one's own painting projects! 
 ¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best! 
 I think the book Gorilla My Love had no moral value in it what  so ever. I read this book for my class, and now here I am stuck wrting a 5 paragraph essay about along with countless other pointless things. Now if you had never written this book, it would have never happened, and I would be enjoying my day. The least yoy could have done is made the story good, but no, now I'm just getting beat over the head with it 
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 I ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive 
 I remember reading this book when I was a teen, at a time when the church I was attending was very much into end-time prophecies. Embarrassing as it is to admit it, I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. (*blush*) Yet, 1988 came and went, nothing horrible happened, and I forgot about this steaming pile of dog manure. It didn't matter, though, because there were, and still are, plenty of other "prophetic" books to fill the gap and keep Christians pants-wetting scared. I am no longer a Christian, and in retrospect, I wonder why we were all so scared by Hal Lindsey's nonsense. After all, the end times meant that Sweet Jesus was coming and we'd all be raptured away into the clouds to avoid all the tribulation and terror! I think there was the secret fear that we wouldn't be good enough and our allegedly loving savior would leave us behind on a whim.   At any rate, I wouldn't recommend Hal's book for any purpose other than fireplace kindling, or maybe as a good laugh at the gullibility of desperate and easily frightened people. He is no different than any other self-proclaimed prophet of God, picking whatever scriptures he can to back up his crazy ideas and attempting to use math to count the number of days, weeks, and generations since this or that event. If you must buy it, look for it at thrift stores, where you can pick it up for 50 cents; save your ten bucks for something more worthwhile, like a couple of Spider-Man comics or something 
 "Howl" comes so close to being good. They capture a real authentic "backporch" sound, with great production. The lyrics are passable, the singing isn't too obnoxiously affected. But there just aren't any good songs on here.   It's like when you meet someone who dresses well, seems to share some common interests, and can make small talk like a champ. But then when you finally try to have a substantial conversation you realize they are thoroughly uninteresting, and just sort of suck all around. Well, it's the musical equivalent of that.  They set a great vibe for beer drinking, sitting on the porch, etc. Just like a tape of whales calling to each other really gives you that authentic ocean feel. But nice as they sound, whales don't write good music and niether do the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Alot of people see music's primary function as providing a nice background. I'm sure they'll be pretty happy with this cd. Also, a lot of people are lifeless zombies with no souls.   
 This book lacks the information about the horse more info of everything else. The book put more effort into the apparel and activites of the horse. Than actually telling about horses and what they need 
 A completely out of date book on prison life. Written mostly by self-congratulating, World War 2 nonreligious conscientious objectors. Contains very little usefull information 
 Alison is a doormat.  I didn't find the characters well developed; Alison was not particularly likeable.  This one was a waste of time, I'm afraid 
 People who like this book are stupid and moron, throw rocks at them!!!!!  This book is very sexist!!!!!!!      
 This filter is not, in my estimation, any good. It leaves a sediment , and the end product, the coffee, tastes terrible. Use paper filters insted for a great cup of coffee 
 Early in the text Cashdan makes clear the fact that fairy tales were never intended as children's stories, nor were they meant to convey lessons. Rather, they were a source of entertainment and adventure for adults - characteristics that made the same stories viable later to be adapted for children. He asserts that, rather than teaching specific moral lessons, fairy tales do help children learn to deal with the struggles of everyday life, particularly struggles with what he terms "the seven deadly sins of childhood:" vanity, gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, lust, and deceit. He asserts that the tales teach children through subtle means to resolve "struggles between the positive and negative forces in the self."   Cashdan characterizes the witch-villain as an external manifestation and magnification of the child-hero/ine's inner flaws. Later he states that good and bad female figures relate to the child's positive and negative experiences with the mother figure in her life (never addressing the fact that the good mother is almost always dead or absent in the stories). Cashdan quickly dismisses the possibility of misogyny in the negative portrayal of stepmothers and female villains simply  because fairy tales aren't meant to be taken as faithfully realistic.   Later still he returns to the idea of the witch as representative of the hero/ine's sinful characteristics. The primary premise of his text is that the "Witch must die because the witch embodies the sinful parts of the self." This concept reinforces the patriarchal implication that evil is feminine in nature and suggests that it is the "negative" female aspects of the child's character which must be annihilated in order for her to live happily ever after.   Cashdan also claims that witches in fairy tales are often depicted as cannibalistic in order to identify them as fully repugnant and therefore deserving of annihilation; in fact, cannibalism was perceived as an earmark of witchcraft during the European witch hunts. This simple statement (as well as his flaccid bibliography) betrays the fact that Cashdan's text is poorly researched and that he often substitutes speculation for informed observations. Due to its inherent inconsistencies and oversights, Cashdan's text is utterly useless unless to provide points to argue against 
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 I orinally posted a very sarcastic review of this product, but when I contacted the seller, I was given a full refund.  Therefore, I will say they have good customer service, but I still don't think the product is useful for storing magazines.  They are made of a plastic that is simply not rigid enough to support a stack of magazines.  
 i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift. at first he was thrilled to get a new one. upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it, he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain, making it almost impossible (and very uncomfortable) to use. He had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way. He did, however, like the other features, namely the light and the pen. 
 This book started out with some interesting ideas and character development but fizzled quickly.  In the first few chapters we are introduced to Joanna who is coming of age in a supernatural way.  Then, she hides out in a sanctuary for nearly the entire remainder of the book!  Basically talking incomprehensible mytho-babble and contemplating her navel.  I couldn't even finish the book - I was so bored by the time she finally planned to face the bad guys that I didn't even care how `the big battle' turned out and I just closed the book without reading it. 
 .....it's the good doctor.  Or should I say the draft-dodging flower picker who only became a "tough guy" when it was safe to do so 
 i'vc had this book since i was 7 years old. i loved the awesome photos of echanis doing his thing. if you like the elaborate and complex, then this is the knife fighting book for you. there are simpler ways of "getting it done", but few are more fun to try. and, by the way, if any of you are curious as to how he died, he was killed while "training" in nicaragua. hmmm . .  
 I was not impressed with this book.  Very little technical data, no data on many of the excellent images in the book.  The writting was flowery and arty rather than concise with information to convey.  If your looking for a book to teach you something, I would not recommend this book.    John Shaw's Nature Photography book is, however, outstanding 
 This is a mess. It's difficult to imagine who this is aimed at. There's far too little information to use it as a 'what to watch' guide for the casual viewer. Horror fans will find their blood boiling as cult classics are panned while borderline mainstream dreck enjoys generous appraisal. Many masterpieces simply aren't there while a worryingly large number of nominally horror-based porn and kids cartoon shows take their place. Most of these aren't easily available, I get the impression the author hasn't seen a lot of them, and I can't imagine many horror fans wanting to anyhow. No 'Masque of the Red Death'? Don't worry, here's a few episodes of 'The Flintstones' featuring Count Rockula! Bizarre.   Maybe it started out as an attempt to be definitive, then gave up as deadlines loomed. Who knows? Stephen Jones - at least I assume this is the same author - has penned numerous books and articles on the horror genre, but judging by this, has burnt out on monsters somewhere along the line. Which is fair enough, but expecting those who still relish all things creepy and ghoulish to put up with this limp effort is not. Very poor and faintly insulting to the genre it attempts, and conspicuously fails to cover.  
 I cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par Testament release.  Testament must have taken hints from Metallica and tried to attract a different audience.  This is not a horrible album, but compared to any other Testament album, it is easily their worst.  Only the die-hard Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this up.    
 Peter Robinson is one of my favorite mystery writers.  I am now trying to get through the audio cd version of Playing with Fire.  The narrator, as I can picture him, is speaking with the spittle collecting and the corners of his mouth.  His attempt at portraying the characters' voices is pathetic.  He should just read it straight out as his "normal" voice is not bad at all.  The story will be good, I know, but have to suffer through this reading may not be worth it 
 After reading and greatly enjoying the first volume (The 42nd Parallel) in Dos Passos' acclaimed "USA trilogy", I quickly moved on to this next volume. Picking up where that one left off, it takes the reader from America's entry in World War I through the end of the war. As with "The 42nd Parallel", this is done by following several characters through the war era, interspersed with Dos Passos' experiment modernist sequences "The Camera Eye" and "Newsreel." (These are kind of abstract prose collages or montages comprised of headlines, snatched phrases of songs, news clippings, and random phrases -- presumably intended to convey some of the mood and seeming frenetic pace of the time. At the time they might have seemed startling and striking, however to me they muddy up what is already a wide-ranging and complex narrative.) There are also sketches of major figures, such as Woodrow Wilson, Teddy Roosevelt, Joe Hill, J.P. Morgan, and the Unknown Soldier, which are miniature masterpieces of biography.   Unfortunately, while that first book was a revelation, I found this one exceedingly tedious. Dos Passos' antiwar sentiment is so strong and vociferous throughout the book that it lacks the range of the first book and settles into a more or less repetitive rut. While it's certainly instructive to see how almost a century ago, a nation could be easily seduced by manufactured patriotism, Dos Passos' take is so decidedly ideological that he masks some of the complexities of the situation. His bitter cynicism about it all -- which, to be fair, was hard won through his ambulance duty on the Western Front -- results in a very negative novel, in which all relationships are a failure, all promises broken, all politics corrupt, and even those who mean well are rendered ineffective by larger forces.  The book introduces a new set of characters, including a sailor, a poet, a Jewish radical, a small-town Texas woman, and a preacher's daughter. However, for some reason, their tales aren't nearly as compelling as those in "The 42nd Parallel." While this may be because they are overshadowed by the war, it doesn't help that many characters from that earlier book turn up in France to steal a good deal of the narrative thunder. In any event, what was exciting about the first book is decidedly less so here, and I don't think I'll move on to complete the trilogy -- at least not any time soon. 
 Alanis Morissette has one of the most irratating singing voices I have EVER heard. I would literally kill myself if I ever forced to listen to her music for an hour straight. If you want to listen to some annoying chick yodel, buy this piece of crap people call music. 
 It is a heap op philosophy, not science. No formula, math, explanation, working examples whatsoever. Just small-talk to fill up the pages. This is NOT a physics book. I was lured into buying it thinking to get a complete textbook on Gödel's explanation of time. Forget it, this book is not worth your money. Go check the internet for PDF's or webpages containing the original publications of Gödel, they are there allright 
 I very rarely put down a book before finishing it, even if I don't like it.  This one was impossible for me to read, though, and even though I tried, I could only get a quarter of the way through it (200 pages) before I decided life is just too short for such aggravation.    I wanted this to be one of those books that you can get lost in and sticks with you once it's over...it's very long, spans many years in the lives of the characters, interesting plot idea, definitely seemed to fit the bill of a pleasurable read.  It didn't turn out to be one of those books, however.  To begin with, it's slow.  On top of that, the story unfolds through a narrator (the author I suppose) who goes off on tangents unrelated to the story, making personal observations on people and life and society in general that last for paragraphs and even pages. Very frustrating!  The book would have been half as long if the author had stuck to what we wanted to read about...the story.  I gave this book 2 stars instead of one because I can see how the story itself would be an engaging one.  Too bad the author's own voice torpedoed it.  Edited: I finally picked up Vanity Fair again and forced myself to finish it.  I hate leaving anything undone and couldn't leave the book unfinished. I still love the actual story and I still have no patience for the interminable narrative.    
 Rimbaud's crackling poetic prose and gorgeous poetry is full of inventive energy in French: in this translator's English, it is flat, stilted, awkward and energyless. If you read French, the book's OK, because you have the original on facing pages. But if you read French, why buy this 
 Couldn't find anyplace else on Amazon to review the Dymo Letra Tags. I am probably returning both models that I purchased. The more expensive model (QX50) has a Qwerty keyboard, but prints horribly, if at all. On a single line of bold text, it printed just about nothing. It prints 2-lines of normal text, with contrast set at the highest level, very irregularly. You can see some letters but not others. This is supposed to be their newer model. The next level down (a few bucks less) looks more like a calculator in it's design; long and narrow (N10926?). It prints really well; very crisp letters even just at regular contrast. Unfortunately in 2-line mode it will not center the lines, has less symbols (I need inch marks), and requires 6 batteries to the other model's 5. (Perhaps the extra power makes it print better though?) I'm pretty disappointed. The tapes are much more expensive than the old emobossed wheel gun models they make. LetraTag tapes provide only 13 feet of tape. I wanted to make labels for my garden stakes. I'm going to take a look at the Brother and Casio lines of label makers and hope there's something better 
 I am surprised by all the good reviews this book has received.  To start with, this book is mainly about a woman who says 1) she isn't very good at housework and 2) just plain doesn't want to do it, so she hires it out. Now, mind you, there is *nothing* wrong with that attitude, people hire out tasks all the time for those very reasons.   However, throughout the book, she makes derogatory assumptions such as:  Housekeeping is a no skills/low skills job People who choose to be housekeepers aren't very smart Children can't be trained to take over housekeeping tasks  And so on--too many to list here, and then in other parts of the book she goes and contradicts some of her previous statements.  Her arguments for hiring a housekeeper are of the whiny, I-shouldn't-have-to-do-this-demeaning-work type, and she brings up the tired, "traditional" man vs. woman arguments, as well as "we're all too busy". Do men and women argue over housework? Of course, but these days usually the arguments are neatnik vs. slob, not about who's doing (or not doing) the dishes. Are people busier than they used to be? Maybe, but that is a choice you make, not something forced on you.   Children need some chores to teach them life skills for when they leave home--the few chores she leaves for children in her book are a joke. If you're willing to take the time to train a new housekeeper, why not spend that quality time training your children instead? Not to mention that, if you're truly willing to pay for housekeeping, why not pay family first?  She has a cost justification worksheet, where for example she states that you save money by having your housekeeper prepare your meals. Well, no, you're shifting the costs from buying convenience foods and/or eating out to paying your new employee. And, by the way, her website where she says there are forms to use does not work.  In one way, this book was unintentionally funny--in the back she has a list of references. In it, she lists books such as The Sidetracked Sisters Catch Up On the Kitchen.  If she'd taken time to actually *read* the book, and their first book, Sidetracked Home Executives, she would have learned that it would not be necessary to hire a housekeeper. Once you go to all the trouble to clean up for the housekeeper and get a system in place (which Sherman insists on, by the way, so that a housekeeper will *want* to work for you), the little that is left to do could easily be accomplished by her children, her, and her husband. For example, one of the DAILY tasks for her housekeeper is to vacuum the entry, living room, etc. Well, if you have a "no shoes" policy, you could vacuum once a week, or even every other week.    After reading this book, I still was not convinced that hiring out your housekeeping would allow you to increase your income, or even save you money, although it might make you feel better.   Now, on the other hand, a housekeeper would be quite helpful, say if you have several children under 5 at home, or are looking into one for an elderly parent, you're recovering from surgery, etc., and for someone in these situations, this book would be helpful for overcoming objections to hiring one.  But for the vast majority of people, let's be honest, hiring out housekeeping is a *luxury*, not a necessity.   The book has a few useful food recipes, some tips on getting your point across, and a sample housekeeper schedule that you might find useful. Borrow from your library first, before buying.   I also suggest that people read "Your Money or Your Life" along with this book to get some perspective. Would you rather do a little housework here and there on your terms and timetable, or work at a job that not only costs you money to go to, but puts restrictions on how you spend your time and creates extra stress in your life so that you can hire a housekeeper 
 Good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--"Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.  EDIT: From now on I am never giving a book that I halfway like two stars again because each time, I receive the urge to change my rating to three stars.  Just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three 
 Recently I got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years.  Unfortunately, I had to recall `Confidence'-easily the worst book I've read in years.  To describe it as disappointing is to go easy on Ms. Kanter.  It is far beyond that, and altogether abominable and embarrassing.  That such a prestigious business school like Harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind.  Let's start with the central (and only) idea of the book--that winning begets winning and losing begets losing.  This of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book's worth of elaboration.  Yet Ms. Kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details: why this is the case (as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn't figure it out in a couple of minutes), how it affects team morale, how it self-perpetuates, etc...  And worst of all, endless, endless, endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate; rather, they simply restate what has just been said.  And they restate and restate and restate.  Tautological (I think the word was invented in anticipation of this book), boring, tedious, insipid, stupid, unthoughtful, unenergetic, disengaged, disrespectful.  All these adjectives apply forcefully to the book.  Most of all, though, it is utterly uninventive and cliched.  Turn to any page and you'll find such gems of penetrating insight as (forgive me, but these are so funny I have to quote at length):   "Winning feels good, and good moods are contagious.  Success makes it easier to view events in a positive light, to generate optimism.  It produces energy and promotes morale.  It is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target."  (P. 29)  "Overcoming obstacles, leaping over hurdles, and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure." (P. 71)  "Once the 'loser' label gets slapped on, those suffering losses are set up to fail.  They find it harder to get support, harder to get opportunities." (P. 115)  "Various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks.  Bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person; long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people.  Execution is play by play, game by game, while strategy is season by season..." (P. 178)  "People embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced, but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good.  It takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it.  Restoring people's (sic) confidence in one another requires four kinds of action..." (P. 241)  "Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome, but what happens when outcomes are negative?  The dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks...  That decision to build rather than retreat, to rally rather than get discouraged, involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens, as an opportunity to learn and move on." (P. 357)  And it just goes on and on, mercilessly and cluelessly.   The wisest, most incisive business people read, study and think about far more than just sports and business.  I would recommend Ms. Kanter first enroll in a decent freshman-level literature or history seminar.  There she can learn to write and, with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck, to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem-solving.  Beyond this bilge, I have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence.  These are: selected essays by Montaigne and Emerson, `Hamlet', Whitman's "Song Of Myself", David Herbert Donald's biography `Lincoln', `Emotional Intelligence', `Flow', and Jack Welch's `Winning'.  `Confidence' inspires confidence only in the realization that you (no matter who you are) are at least intelligent enough to be the "Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor" at Harvard Business School 
 Same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review.  They sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set, and will not honor the same price for the bedding set.  I have to send it back and they will give a refund.  What a hassle 
 I found lots of annoying aspects to this 2004 Third Edition of Shapiro's J. K. Rowling biography.    What had to be the most annoying was that  Shapiro apparently just slapped extra material at the end of the book each time he came out with a new edition.  At the end of what must have been the original 2001 edition, Shapiro talks about 2001 events in the present tense, and about looking forward to what will come in 2002.  This appears to be the case again where the 2002 edition must have originally ended.  Apparently there was no major revision of the material in the earlier editions for this new 2004 edition - it was simply added to for each new edition.  Among other weaknesses, the book is very repetitive and choppy, with the chronology often disorganized.  Also, the author's personal comments did not seem very insightful.  He mentions several times what a good husband and father Rowling's second husband is and how happy the marriage is, not as a quote from anyone, but just as stated "fact."  The book contained plenty of good and interesting information, and I believe that the inaccuracies that other reviewers mentioned from earlier editions have been mostly corrected (as it matched most information I've read from other sources, which Shapiro is often good about citing).  However, some major editing needs to be done on the book 
 When a book that is so provably fictional as CROW KILLER is praised repeatedly for being "true" and "accurate," the review says more about the values and fantasies of the reader than about the book.  CROW KILLER is a vicious racist diatribe that perpetuates a comic book view of the fur trade. Johnson wasn't a "mountain man," he was one of the jackals who drifted in a generation later to pick the bones--a buffalo slaughterer and a wolf killer. And a racist among men who understood the Indians better than most.  Vardis Fisher's MOUNTAIN MAN has a good deal of racism in it, but Fisher manages to maintain a distance between his own values and those of the mountain men. He gives the Indians a chance to tell their own story, and he tempers the cultural racism of the mountain men with their firsthand knowledge of the people around them. JEREMIAH JOHNSON goes even further in that direction, and that, for one thing, is why I consider the Redford/Pollack film the best of the three works.  The Indians in Fisher and Redford's stories are real people with intelligence, courage, and a way of looking at the world that is different from ours but not inferior. In CROW KILLER, Indians are stupid, vicious (and look who's talking), subhuman. Poisoning forty Blackfeet warriors is, you see, a joke. Any REAL (that is to say, "white") man can kill them in handfuls.  Get over it. The mountain men were no more glamorous that Hell's Angels or that vicious little twerp Billy the Kid (Michael Pollard, folks, not Val Kilmer, Kris Kristoferson, or Paul Newman). They went west to get rich, just like the grubby gold-mad prospectors we don't idolize at annual "re-enactments."  They went west because they were too sociopathic to survive in civilized society, and they admired the Indians because they appeared, to the outlaw white, to be a lawless ("adulterous", as Chris Lapp says) people. And libertarians, like Fisher, worship them because they are so utterly self-absorbed, self-important, and "free" of society. And romantic city boys, their drawers damp with admiration, called their manifestation of sociopathy "freedom." Right, like the "freedom" of meth-lab enterpreneurs on their Harley vibrators.  So if you enjoy racist humor and violence, and you love perpetuating stereotypes about Indians, and you want to admire somebody who, if he really were who you think he is, would beat you to a pulp just for fun, go for it. But don't call it history, Ok? It's no more history than HUSTLER is gynecology 
 Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man understands women! The only woman who could be 'explained' by this nonsense is one who's been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy, and there are quite a few of that type in America (and in Saudi Arabia, and in Afghanistan, and ....).   For a book that does explain women, to both women and men, see Simon de Beauvoir's 'The Second Sex'. Excellent text, I've read and reread it many times, with greeat benefit. 
 I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one 
 This book only gets 2 stars from me because 3 or so chapters are actaully worthy of reading. The remainder compells the reader to gouge out their own eyeballs to avoid reading another sentence of the poorly written chapters. You'd think with having 3 authors they could do better than this but alas...no. Most likely you don't have a choice of whether or not to read this book however I am a better man for not having to read this book again. I'll be getting my MBA in 8 days and look forward to NOT reading books like this for the rest of my natural life. Best of luck, you'll need it 
 In this book, author James Redfield suggests that the Mayans disappeared because they moved to a higher plane of existence. The unnamed main character quits his job within the first four pages of the book to look for a Mayan manuscript (containing nine new-age insights) in Peru. First of all, Mayans occupied parts of Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador, and most of Guatemala and Belize; not Peru. No wonder our intrepid adventurer couldn't find them. Not to mention the fact that Mayans didn't dissapear. Mayan civilization collapsed; however, you can go to these areas and meet thier descendents. So based on the fact that I have met several, I doubt seriously they are invisible due to being on a higher plane of existence. Other laughable elements include a Latin preist named "Father Carl" and the fact that the manuscript is written in Aramaic with no explanation given as to why. I could pass all this off as merely devices by which the author intends to explain his new-age insights but Redfield is really serious about this stuff, so are many fans of this book. Fans of this book are the same people who put a Buddha statue in thier house then claim to be knowledgable about Eastern religions, yet have never attended any Eastern religious ceremonies. I base that statement on actual people who have recommended this rubish to me. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. If you are misfortunate enough to have already paid for it; I recommend rubbing garbage all over every page, closing it back up, and then loaning it to a friend you hate. This will give them the same feeling I had while reading this travesty. The tenth insight should be, "If you paid for this book, you proved P.T. Barnum correct. 
 Pro: Book taught me about the necessary things I needed to build my pc.  Con: The book basically told you about the products that they are selling. I don't like the fact that they limit it to those products and wanted to learn about other products that were available 
 This "dictionary" is extremely non-descriptive. It supplies the latin names, but will define them only as a deciduous tree, or a flowering shrub. That does not explain to me what it looks like compared to other  plants. It also has no pictures, so there is no help there. If you want to  really learn the latin names of plants, spend the extra money for an  illustrated and more desciptive reference dictionary 
  This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.  Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.  I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.  More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.  That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow and arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead. 
 The idea for the book was great, but the book was way too long, although the ending wasn't quite long enough. You shouldn't read this book until your 16 or 17, at least. It was way too confusing for me. Some parts of the book were more intersting than the others, and it was interesting to see into her life, but definately not a book to put on a young adults list 
 Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. 
 I bought this book because David Sedaris recommended it at the last reading I attended.  The stories are all on the "dark" side and they do not appeal to me.  Admittedly, I prefer something much more light hearted, so others may love this book 
 I'm an agronomist and I read this trash-book, here in Brazil. This book , as a tipical pseudo-historic book, puts some real things.Even with some real things, all are used as a cover to frauds and bigoted anti-catholic absurds. A tipical anti-catholic absurd is the claim in this book, that Pius XII was a racist, using the "fact" that this Pope claimed that any "Black" american soldier in Rome, because Pius XII "thought" they were rapers. Nonsense.The real allied troop full of rapers and in Italy, wasn't a black american division.It was really an arabian troop serving the De Gaulle's "Free France".This trash-book "forgets" the fact and invent an anti-catholic fraud. In fact, Pius XII was an eugenics' foe. The opposite was true among famous protestants and jews, at that times. During the civil rights fights in USA, during 1950 decade, Pius XII showed that he was against eugenics/racism again. This trash book draws an absurd and never existed Pius XII. Who gave power to Hitler were eugenicists and communists. Pius XII ever was a Hitler's foe 
 I found this book to be poorly written and repetitive.  Needed some more peer/editorial reviews before going to market.  Could not even get past the first 3 chapters 
 A learning resource manual is not the same as the real book! It's just for teachers, so they know questions what questions to ask on a test 
 Hard as it is to do, this film manages to make Jet Li look very, very bad. I kept having Karate Kid flashbacks! The story is the same old, same old, American martial arts move cliches, fighting for honor and all...in a place that is obviously NOT Los Angeles. The real disappointment is that the martial artists( in come cases obviously just local students for God sake!) are sub par and the choreography suffers for it. The action sequences are slow and awkward. Pass on this one guys 
 As a molecular and cellular biology major, I've taken my fair share of biology courses and know a good deal about the workings of the body and its cells/organs. The ways in which mitosis, nerves, etc. are described in this book are decent, but there's no argument as to HOW or WHY any superior force possibly would have created such a body. The author plays the chicken-and-egg game with too many topics and ultimately lumps himself with the Intelligent Design crowd. This book may serve as a biology primer for some, but there's no proof and very little discussion on God. Considering that the title and his previous books' titles mention God, why would this book have almost no discussion on God? The layout of the chapters is as follows: 20 pages of biological explanation, followed by a few paragraphs that ask questions about God or origins or something similar - but the questions make little sense and go unanswered. I went into this book with an open mind and was floored by his superficiality. Save your money and time 
 Mary's rounding up of Protestant revolutionaries, while deplorable, pales in comparison to the crimes of her father King Henry VIII and her half-sister Queen Elizabeth I.    Prior to Henry and Elizabeth, Catholicism was woven into the fabric of English society.  You can still find echoes of it today in everything from patterns of speech (the omnipresent adjective "bloody" is a truncation of the oath "By Our Lady") to place names (Blackfriars refers to a Dominican priory).    That is why it was necessary for Henry and then Elizabeth to turn England into a virtual police state to effect the former's violent, imposed Anglican revolution.  Elizabeth executed more than 800 Englishmen in the first year alone of her forty-year reign.  Much as Protestants imitated and countered Catholic books on authentic martyrs once they grew in popularity (through the so-called "Foxe's Book of Martyrs"), so too does this book merely attempt to undo the growing recognition by scholars that the anti-Catholic "Whig interpretation" of history that held sway for centuries was and is nothing more than state propaganda 
 I have written software for development projects for 30 years and I have managed several projects. Martin Fowler has extraordinary insight, and I enjoy reading his papers for the gems of thought I find.   The main lesson I pick up from this book is: Break your large project into projects sufficiently small that you can sensibly abandon Refactoring for each of the small projects.  Refactoring works well in some cases, I suppose. Refactoring works well for some people, I suppose. I'm skeptical, though. Fowler filled the book with page after page of the detailed Refactoring method applied to a problem he acknowledged as too simple for application of Refactoring. He assures us that Refactoring may overload small projects with methodology, making it unsuitable for them, and it works really well for larger projects. I suspect, however, that the burden it imposes enlarges as the job enlarges. Fowler gives me no good reason to think otherwise. If I'm to risk this methodology on a large project, I want to see it perform well on a smaller project first.  Fowler conceives methodologies that attract zealous disciples. In the case of Refactoring, the methodology may succeed for its attractiveness rather than for its practical utility 
 My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years. Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent. Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless. Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper. If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere 
 extremely poor quality tools. complete waste of money for this price. barely worth $10 
 I saw a lot of bad review about this crappy item, but like a silly guy I bought it! Be aware that it may be an nonreturnable item. If you were me, don't spend your money on this pick! Buy a real chorus gear 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 OK, let's face it: You know as soon as you read the title that this book is a bad joke.  A young adult novel called "Terry and the Pirates"?  Come on.  But the ridiculous title is fitting to the ludicrous story within, written very poorly to boot.  Not enjoyable at all.  This book is one unbelievable situation after another, and the author is not nearly skilled enough to make it whimsical or fun.  Instead, the author seems to try to take its material seriously, and does NOT succeed.  I read this book because I was bored and I'm usually willing to give any book a try.  But don't make the mistake I did.  There are plenty of other YA novels for fun light reading out there 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 This "bio" which was obviously hastily churned out right after the 1994 assault on Nancy Kerrigan, doesn't tell the reader anything that hasn't already been printed in news stories. It's doubtful that the writers even interviewed anyone in the Harding camp; for instance, they repeatedly refer to her mother as LaVona Golden, when the woman doesn't even use that name. A shameless attempt to cash in on the scandal 
 Either Jesus Christ, the Son Of God spoke the Truth in Matthew 24:35 and we have a "Perfect Bible" preserved today in the Authorized Version, commonly called The King James Bible or he lied----which this book purports to.  THIS BOOK IS GARBAGE !  
 Poorly proof read and obfuscatingly written, this book had the potential to clarify for the many the importance of Black's contributions.  It was a frustrating read due to lack of clarity and lack of simple explanations about the significance of Black's work 
 Unfortunately i bought this book before i read the reviews. Not only is the information overly specific and not what they actually ask, the format of the questions and practice tests in the book are completely different from the ones on the actual test. They ask wierdly formatted questions about maps and different speakers that are just plain outdated. The numbers of questions in the practice tests are even wrong. 
 Okay, the concept of this game cube is great, and believe me: you will spend many hours trying to solve this puzzle. Now on to the reality... I first tried this brain buster in the eighties when it came out. Upon its first release, the stickers stayed on, the plastic squares didn't break off, and it just seemed like a higher quality piece. I beleive the plastic might have been heavier. But now, twenty years later, the stickers peal off, the squares pop out. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!  If this was made in the USA it would now cost more than it does being manufactured over seas, however ...it wouldn't be junk. You get what you pay for.  Stephen John Beccia Author of The Treelanders 
 One would have to be a glutton for punishment to sit through this many Oliver Stone movies in a row.  But, I see Stone is artfully packaging himself these days now that he has nothing new to offer, unless you count his homage to Fidel Castro.  The only movies worth watching are his early movies, Salvador and Platoon, which for some reason didn't make the cut. Instead, you have the insufferable Born on the Fourth July and his conspiracy theories on the death of JFK, with a whole lot of filler in between 
 I lost the weights the second day of use. Bottom line the motion of the water as you swim unscrews the weights from the camera body. Save your money on this one. 
 This was a very disappointing book.  Most of it flows like a string of daily recaps of the Athletics' individual games with expanded one-liner quotes from the three pitchers.  Those quotes are not particularly insightful, mostly soporific comments about each others' personalities or reactions to silly media questions.  It does a good job of chronciling the emotional ups and downs of injuries, streaky performances, and shortcomings of teammates, but it does not get into strategy within games, take a team perspective in the fight to win the division, or do a good job of storytelling at all.  This last one is an especially noticeable shortfall considering this book has the hard position of following Moneyball.  Urban apparently had no access to the front office as there is little to no discussion of the trades GM Billy Beane makes or the business end.  The teasers that make you want to read this book- complaints about tight-fisted management, Zito's dating Alyssa Milano, Hudson's bar fight during the Boston playoff series- are very short (no more than 1-2 pages each) and disappointing.  In sum, it's a full season version of a beat writer's experience following a team, and much of it, you feel like you are reading the local newspaper's daily story 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 After reading so many rave reviews, I decided to buy this video. I  owe many, many workout videos and this is the most boring by far. I have never been able to complete it. Very dissapointing! 
 If only they'd put as much effort into sound processing as they do the computer graphics, this would be a great disc.  As it is, it sounds like a bootleg-quality ripoff made from a videotape.  At least someone could've flipped on the Dolby switch.  Perhaps they're saving that for the "remastered" edition 
 Oh boy. I wish I didn't have to finish every book. It is just a pet peeve of mine. However, I couldn't get into this book. I see no clear theme. I know everyone was horrified at 9/11, however the theme went throughout the book and made the book even worse. What happens to all the characters? One is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on Starbucks? Another one goes back to her husband. One runs into a tree while skiing and dies. Frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad. Jeez, I was really hoping to like this book, but I just am relieved it is over 
 This transfer looks like a poor cam shot in a theater. I have seen better bootlegs from cam shots than this DVD. It looks horrible. I wish I could rank the film seperate from the DVD quality -- since I can't, I am going to put 1 star due to the transfer; if I could put a lower rating, I would. That's how unprofessional this transfer is. 
 I use this text for an AP Computer Science course, and find it to be one of the most confusing books on the topiic of Java and Computer Science. Being in multiple APs, I obvisouly cannot read every single word and frequently have to sort out what information is relevant in a book. In most of my textbooks, this is rather easy. Horstmann's book is, however, quite the exception. The authos literally interupts his own sentences and sections with dozens of "Random facts," "Productivity Hints," "Advanced Topics," and many more of these litte interuptions. One chapter, I forget which one, actually has three of these strung in a row, manking this book incredibly hard to read. After cutting out in the middle of a topic, it is very common to just, without warning, start back up five pages later. Avoid this book 
 everything in this book is common sense.  There is really very little to learn from this, and it is overpriced 
 I brought the magnif crazy coin keeper, hoping it would help me sort out my money so I can make a deposit, (I've been collecting change since I was a kid). However, upon opening my package, I realized it was broken. I brought the proper batteries and installed them correctly, and when I turned it on, nothing happened, no coins were sorted 
 With all due respect to sincere but sincerely misguided believers who look to Carl Sagan+Hugh Ross scientific priesthood to explain Genesis Origins for them 'logically & scientifically', address these loving Christian concerns:  1) It's o.k. to debate biblical issues in a public forum. Attacks on the faith come from outside and INSIDE. Ross is unwittingly attacking the authority of Scripture from INSIDE and needs rebuking in love and truth.  2) It's not whether some portions of Scripture are literal vs. nonliteral. It's letting the Bible speak for itself and clearly indicate how it's to be read. 'God as Rock' in Psalms is poetry. Genesis is NOT Psalms or even psalmic. 'Evening and morning were first day', etc. is NOT poetry or figurative. See Exodus 20:9-11 '6 days you shall labor, but the 7th day is a Sabbath.In 6 days the LORD made heaven and earth..but rested on the 7th day.' Is this poetry? Psalms? Not. Sorry to all who force this historic documentary narrative text to be plastic enough to insert saganism billions & billions. It just is not what Moses intended to write or Hebrews understood him to mean. Nor should it be today. Yom can sometimes (not normatively) mean indefinite period, but NOT here. Try your theory elsewhere.  3)Take care when you depend on modern astrophysics to interpret the plain Bible text. Moses was not a PhD nor scientist. Neither are billions who have read Genesis in the past 3500 years. If vast majority take Moses in plain simple sense 6 days equals Sunday thru Friday of first workweek, astrophysics reinterpreting it to 17 billion years is humanism dismissing God's creative supernatural miracles. Reductionism and unbelief.  4)What's the big deal whether Genesis is real, literal, documentary, history book young earth recent creation as plainly stated in situ? Get it wrong here and it carries over to the rest of Scripture. If Genesis 1-11 is poetry or nonliteral story or myth or figures of speech, then so is Exodus, plagues, Red Sea, miracles, Ex.20:9-11, etc. and even into New Testament documents. It's now all up for grabs just the way satan wants it. By all means, doubt the plain wording of God's Word! Slippery slope-ism = sloppy theology = slapdash hermeneutics = slippage in Christian faith.  5)To be fair, why not try reversing the 'harmonization' process? Instead of forcing Scripture into Sagan-Ross mold of fallible secular theory of billions & billions of lightyears, try letting 6 calendar days of God's infallible heavenly recording of eyewitness events be the fixed standard of how human inquiry should be reconciled to the real record. Science must be somehow wrong in its assumptions, assessments, conclusions. God must have turned heaven's lights on instantly with speed of light = infinity during sun/moon/star creation Day 4 when scattered, disembodied light already existed for 72 hours instantly became bodied. Today's scientists from saganism to rossism are using earthbound measurements on heavenly reality. Their mistake is understandable given limited preconceived notions of how things operate POST-miracle week. God's presuppositions are needed as divine corrective. Telescopes and parallax and triangulation and math don't work on Creation Week itself any more than other sciences trying to figure out and measure Jesus' DNA, changing water to wine instantly, casting out demons, Peter's shadow healing the sick or the Lord's resurrection, materializing in and out of sight over 40 days penetrating locked doors with a real flesh/blood body, ascension, etc.  Friends, it's all a category mistake. You simply can't use earthy calipers to come to grips with heavenly data. Back to the drawing board of faith in Genesis-Revelation AS WRITTEN ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD BY AUTHOR/AUDIENCE of 1500BC to avoid the fallacy in saganism-rossism-modernism-revisionism-secularsciencism.   Peace to all who let Christ's Bible speak without manscience stretching 1 young week.  
 This was outdated and simple before it was pubslished. You can read better info just glancing at some white papers for web analytic firms.  Even the person the author got to write a preface only suggested reading a few chapters - which you could read in no-time-at all.  
 Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for "Judith Miller" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.   Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims. 
 The issue of how best to govern a nation is of great importance and should be explored through intellectual, logical debate.  Dahl's book does not carry the weight this topic deserves because he entirely avoids exposure of the logical constructs from which his conclusions stem.  Dahl's unstated presupposition is that democracy is a superior form of government compared with representative democracy.  This presupposition is never discussed and simply assumed true by Dahl.  This is strong evidence that Dahl hopes to persuade, not promote his ideas in this op-ed piece.  Since he offers no logical constructs regarding his specific ideas and avoids direct questioning of potential hazards of his ideas, he does not offer the non-critically thinking reader pause for review.  Instead he promotes safe, non-threatening ideas that will be easily agreed to by the reader.  Once the reader is agreeing with what is said it is nearly effortless to get the reader to agree to the next idea, even if the two ideas are completely unrelated.  In fact, the very fashion in which Dahl presented his justification for changing the constitution was one such trick.    Dahl states that during the time of the constitutional convention we were far less technologically advanced.  He tells the reader that DaVinci could have done absolutely marvelous things had modern technology been at his dispose.  This is certainly debatable if one were to stop and question what circumstances allowed DaVinci to do what he had done.  However, for most, this is an idea that will be readily agreed to and will strike imagination and hope, exactly the combination needed to persuade people of such things as Dahl desires.  Dahl never strikes his assumption that technological advances also bring about social and political advances, for which he could have at least made a case.  He never brings the topic for discussion and simply behaves as if the point had been struck.  However, societal advances are not directly conjured through technological advances and in many cases societal norms become less democratic (what Dahl would call more advanced) with technological advances.  And thus, we can see why Dahl avoided intellectual debate and instead opted for a trick.  This is an old, extremely effective sales trick which has personally been used to do things like sell movies to people that did not own a television and found movies morally wrong.  This anecdote is not just presented to expose Dahl's method, but is also presented here to strike a point:  People are gullible and will easily agree to do things to which they are morally opposed, much less unsure of or apathetic to.  This is the very reason to avoid a direct democracy and there are historical examples of such things happening, which of course, Dahl fails to acknowledge.  Furthermore, it is precisely self-serving tricksters that the founding fathers had in mind when writing the constitution--no wonder Dahl detests it so.  Dahl uses others tricks that an unsuspecting reader will miss.  For example, Dahl goes through some effort to legitimize his term "founding framers," in preference to "founding fathers."  This has absolutely no relevance to the discussion of representative government versus pure democracy.  However, what it does do is remove a name that places the creators of the constitution on a pedestal and replaces it with something less reverent.  This is not to suggest that changing the name to "founding framers," and removing some of the reverence is a bad thing.  But combined with the other tricks in this book, it is highly suspicious and comes across as name calling.    Furthermore, it is a rather surprising move on Dahl's part after he showed such deftness with persuasion (discussed in the previous paragraph) in other parts of the book.  The reason it is surprising is that the very people he would hope to convince would likely be the people that would put his book away after reading this passage.  Dahl is certainly not a dumb individual; so for whom is this book written, the like minded or the variant of Dahl?  It is most likely the latter of the two. He claims that Tocqueville predicted a "collapse of society," due to the nature of a pure democracy and gives examples of trials which modern societies have faced without collapsing.  Yet, again, he fails to address the heart of his argument and instead opts for something safe and at best tangent to his point, i.e. wars and depression which have nothing to do with the nature of democracy causing a legislative overload and collapse.  And yet, Tocqueville is highly accurate when he discusses the stifling laws and regulations that will govern a purely democratic state.  On needs to look no further than license requirements for bicycles in modern democratic countries.  Dahl claims he believes in "intrinsic equality," which he defines as inalienable political equality among all citizens.  He further claims that the intrinsic equality is what not only allows but actually promotes democracy because the majority population will respect the intrinsic equality of the minority population.  So, live and let live, allow for consideration of differences of opinion on even the most important subjects is what Dahl claims to believe in and promote.  However, talk is cheap.  Dahl later states, "...it is difficult for me to see how a significantly different proposition could be defended, particularly if we draw on crucial historical cases...," (131).  He later refers to his own judgments as, "prudent," while referring to the judgments of others as based in "hopeless ignorance."  It appears that Dahl fails to uphold the very standard he promotes as being the basis for a pure democracy.    Dahl directly states that he considers his own opinions correct and prudent and perceives views in variation from his own as invalid.  He claims that the founding fathers had personal motivations and designed our government to promote their own interests.  He claimed that people today are superior that people in the past.  And because of these things, it must seem to Dahl that the debate of a purely democratic society versus a representative democracy is moot.  That said, merit exists in some of his points and objections about our current government.  However, his methods of tricking and avoiding direct promotion of his ideas are distasteful and less effective than its compliment.  Without allowing the reader preview to arguments, one cannot accurately gauge Dahl's position and thus cannot identify where differences of opinion stem.  Since it is highly unlikely that Dahl will be charged with the tasks of creating a new constitution, it is likely that Dahl's work will only benefit his cause by creating a stir among his like-minded, which is certainly not respectful to Dahl's dissenters.      If offered the opportunity, it would be of great interest to hear what Dahl would say regarding the role of pure democracy in the fall of Athens, or to have him explain what mechanism would prevent a pure democracy from passing arbitrary or spiteful laws into action.  Or perhaps it would be good to see a working example of a successful pure democracy in business or politics (money and power); the two things that ultimately drive government action.  These are the issues that his concepts bring forth and since he wholly failed to address them, his book lacks the weight required to address how to best govern a free body of people. 
 Just as a note, I picked up this book at a local used bookstore, in one of the boxes by the exit listed as "FREE." I guess that would be a sort of portent for what was to come next.  The plot is simple and almost cliche enough: ten people gathering for a 30-year college reunion. Ten different stories basically, plus one recount of a dead graduate. These people are in their early fifties, with each little story/chapter reminiscing on their lives after college graduation.  As a previous reviewer has stated, yes, the major flaw with this book that had the potential to be quite good is that all these people are being whiny, whiny, whiny. Now. Of course, everybody has their own right to be sad and whatnot, but these people seem to take it one step further. I'm gonna just get to the point and state that I absolutely abhor the women in this book (except for two). The rest, sadly, are basically just emotionless bitches in some way or another: one thinks she's 'incapable' of falling in love (and note, she was an art major, haha), another is some blonde with 2 husbands because she wants it all, another, I think, gets what she deserves after cheating on her husband. And so forth. And the men? The men, they just basically sit there, brood a little, and take this BS from the women. Not that I'm saying to go and beat the gals up, but at some point, a guy will have to realize that he was being f***ed over by this lady, true love or not, and has to move on and stop wasting precious time over what has already been done.  So if this is adulthood, or rather, being middle-aged--a bleak overview of their failed love lives so far and nothing else--then I think I'm gonna kill myself before I turn forty. The ending was simply ridiculous and not really an ending at all. The conclusion, the characters, it all just made me angry. It could be that O'Brien's intention was to pick the saddest group of lovestruck losers you've ever met to poke fun at them. But if your some heartbroken idiot who can't get over your unrequited-love situation and wish to indulge in a story that shares your pain, this is the book for you. Now, on a personal note, I've known love too, and experienced its pain, but this is just ABSURD. If your fifty, feeling sorry for yourelf, and still aching over what happened years back, stop watching Lifetime and go read up on people who REALLY suffer; our fellow humans in third-world areas and countries that practice political oppression 
 This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.  
 I borrowed this book and am truly glad I didn't buy it. It's  central hook is the idea that Saddam Hussein sent all his WMDs into Syria before he was brought down.  This is utter fantasy. To issue such an order would create Iraqi witnesses (oral, written and electronic messages) and a logistics trail across the entire country. Plus any planes going into Syria would have been stopped by the no-fly zone. And trucks would have been bombed. If not, more evidence (satellite unloading photos, witnesses, regime orders in various forms, etc.) would have been created at the Syrian end. Plus the charming notion that if Saddam actually had WMD, he would rather have sent them in a gift basket to Syria, choosing to 'fight' from a hole rather than use them himself. NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE FOR ANY OF THIS HAS EVER BEEN SHOWN. NOTHING PRESENTED IN THIS BOOK AS 'EVIDENCE' STANDS UP TO SERIOUS SCRUTINY.  In fact there were no WMDs. Get used to it people! Nobody, not even the Bush administration, takes this lying fantasist seriously. Sorry, that's not wholly true. The I-could-have-been-a-neoconservative-if-I-had-a-three-digit-IQ folks who gave this liar high stars obviously do. Did they learn nothing from Adnan Chalabi? If this general had claimed that there were no WMD's, and America had got it wrong, would they have awarded him high stars? Perhaps some reviewers are giving comfort stars, stars to people who make them feel good, rather than what is right?  So why does this guy say what he does? The general claims to  have stood up to Saddam Hussein. Not true -- the  fact that he is alive today proves that. In fact, I saw his interview on The Daily Show (which is when I first became interested in the book) and he constantly sucked up to the American audience, constantly telling them how great their country was, to their uproarious approval. That, folks, is how  he survived and thrived under Saddam. He flatters, tells everyone what they want to hear. Another reviewer who gave this book high stars suggests the general is 'a little bit self serving'. Yes the general is -- in the way that JFK is a little bit assasinated.  Oh, and being a general, don't think he didn't commit any war  crimes along the way. Obviously his sanitised fantasy book has no admission of this. But that's another matter.  And when reviewers make positive mention of the generals Christianity -- sorry, but they committed as many war crimes as the Muslims in Saddam's regime. Saddam promoted them because he was a secularist, feared Islamists, and didn't fear coups by a general from a minority group. But they were no better in power than their Muslim colleagues.  Pretending he knows where WMDs are is obviously this generals chosen path to importance in his new adopted home country. And if you believe him and invade Syria, kill tens of thousands, lose hundreds of your own troops, damage your reputation, spend bilions, and find nothing there ... I bet there will be a Syrian general, with his own ghostwritten book, ready to keep the tradition up 
 Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril 
 ... both "Divorce & Money" books, that is, one by Smith and the other by Woodhouse. And I have to say, while this book DOES have a lower price, in this case you get what you pay for.   Thumbing through Smith's book, I found some helpful information but really, other than stressing that you had to go to a lawyer, a lot of it seemed less fleshed out than Woodhouse's book. Especially if your split is amicable (mine was), a professional needn't be that involved. Within minutes it was clear which book was better, and it wasn't this one 
 I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more. 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 This book would leave no untrained reader to think Saddam was a good guy or beneficial in anyway for Iraq. The book discusses the former Iraqi president (actually dictator) who killed massive amounts of Iraqi kurds, got hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed in an eight year war with Iran that Saddam mostly started and mentions Saddam's takeover of Kuwait. But Saddam is a creep whose bad activities can't be overestimated nor can they can they all be listed and this book doesn't mention how Saddam killed half million Iranians in that war or how much of Iraq went up in flames during that war or how Saddam bombed Tel Aviv with SCUD missiles as part of an attempt to start a whole war with Israel. Missing also is Saddam's second attempt at taking over Kuwait in 1994 plus his misbehavior that caused operation Desert Fox in 1998 plus the fact that Forbes magazine rated Saddam wealthiest man (on earth!) #5 in 1997 at five billion dollars personal fortune and money means power. All this means Saddam was a growing threat when he was taken out in 2003 and it was not just for Iraq but for the sake of much of the rest of the world. The book also fails to mention how Khadafi of Libya quit his own nuclear bomb building project when he saw Saddam get captured in 2003 by fearing that he (Khadafi) might the next to get captured should he not start behaving himself. An added huge benefit to Saddam falling. 
 I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.    A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.    Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James 
 Regrettably, I found the book's condition was too old, which I paid $37 including delivery charge. In school, I also found a used book, looking like a new book, was sold at $40. 
 The book is good, but $130 dollars!!!!  You still need to buy a 3 ring binder to put the sheets in, it's not even a paperback, meaning the publisher didn't even spend the money for binding. Who owns this company, Shell?  Exxon?  Enron?!?  There are other accounting books for a fraction of the cost, but the organized crime (my community college) requires this particular one.  I wonder what their incentive might be?? 
 I loved them at first..dainty and shiny..bought the black patent.  Hard to find flats that are stylish.  They ONLY LASTED 2 WEARS...and that was at a funeral and church..about 2-3 hours a time.  CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!!!! The hole for the back strap stretched so big it's nearly ripped off and I was sitting nearly the entire time so how could this happen?!  I thought Nine West had quality shoes but DON'T BUY these 
 this may easily be one of the dumber movies made in the last hundred years.  and there were a lot of them.  this definitely ranks up in the 10%-tile 
 A director who has no idea how to film dance sequences? An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota of chrisma? (If she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions!) This is...or should have been...about the struggle to not only get a job on Broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade. The all important role of Shiela seems little more than an after thought. Turned into a silly love story (which doesn't even play!) it is merely sad. Sad...and very, very BAD!!!  (the one star rating is because I HAD to rate it! 
 I bought a sharp lcd tv from j& r in new york last Jan, after a year and half, when powering on the tv, sometimes works, sometimes not. after unplug in, wait for a while and plug back, worked for a couple months. Send it to service center to checkup, was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced. when request to get back the replaced lcd control board, was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board, it has to be shipped back, otherwise, you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board.. it's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor..  But, if you do want to get a sharp, better get a long long warranty.. 
 Small makes a few valid points, but he seems too closed-minded.  He critizes Western music too much and sometimes his arguments are just plain stupid 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 I read three versions of the Arthurian legends recently, and this one was the weakest.  The language is somewhere between Malory's archaic form and modern prose, but does not succeed well at being either.  The tales were also, in my opinion, less well told than in the others.  For your consideration, I read La Morte D'Arthur in an abridged version and Roger Lancelyn Green's "King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table" from the Puffin Classics series.  I enjoyed Green's telling the best, as it was credibly compiled from a number of works (including Malory) and had some excellent atmospheric illustrations.  Though it is a Puffin Classics edition, I did not find the usual condescension or "dumbing down" that often occurs in youth literature.    Get Green's version.  It was just as cheap right here on Amazon, and well worth every penny 
 We are traveling the US for almost a year and have purchased the East as well as the West edition before we started. Besides the fact, that we found only a few nice spots described in those books so far, our comments are as follows:  1. The contents of both editions are outdated - certain camgrounds do    simply not exist any more for years!! 2. The directions are awful if not wrong 3. We spent more diesel on finding the described campgrounds than we saved     not to mention the hazzle, driving around in circles 4. Lots of directions seem to be copied from other books we have and are    as wrong as they are in those 5. Campgrounds indicated in the maps by numbers (icons) are not part of    the book anymore 6. The icons in the maps are close to impossible to read (use a    magnifier)  Overall we can absolutely NOT recommend those books to anybody 
 [...]  R. Kent Hughes provides us with another entry into the already very crowded market for Christian books that are a mile wide and an inch deep.  He covers a tremendous variety of topics in an incredibly superficial fashion.  The book reads more like a PowerPoint presentation with  occasional witty anecdotes from the presenter.    My disappointment with this book set in with the reading of the second chapter entitled "Purity."   Now there's a topic that an entire book can be written on, but the author gives us a mere eleven pages, using the famous example of King David and his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba to present us with a five-point sermon on what David did wrong.  He begins the chapter with the usual rant about how the church is no different from the world in regards to sexual sin (true enough).  He then tells us about what David did wrong, and to conclude we get seven subdisciplines to practice in order to keep pure: "accountability", "prayer",  "memorization" (of scripture), "mind" (don't look at pornography), "hedges" (keep away from women), "reality" (you are a sexual being), "divine awareness" (practicing the presence of God).   Each of these subdisciplines gets a short explanation, never exceeding 300 words in length, and  "reality", the shortest of the seven, is explained in mere 52 words.  Brevity can be a wonderful thing, but there are times when it can come off sounding rather superficial.    The problem is that all these subdisciplines will not work if a person has emotional and personal issues that need to be overcome first. Any man can partake of these seven practices and still fall into temptation with the greatest of ease, as long as there exists issues in the heart that have never been fully dealt with.  Instead of dealing with the deeper issues regarding sexual sin, we get pat answers to apply to a wounded psyche, which is like applying band-aids to someone who is suffering from internal bleeding.   It's not always pride that causes a man to fall.    Another problem is the loose fashion in which Hughes uses the term "discipline."  For me discipline is a nearly synomous term with training, and in the Christian walk, there are just a few key disicplines that bring the greatest benefit.  But Hughes brings up many, many "disciplines" that just aren't true disciplines.  "Mind" and "reality" from the purity chapter are just two examples, and even purity itself.  Purity in the Christian sense is the abscense of sin, but not doing something isn't exactly what I would call a discpline.     Another mistake is the egalitarian nature in which Hughes presents all his various discplines.  No prioritization or hierarchy is given, he presents them in such a way that they all seem equally important.  But those who are succesfully living the Christian life only practice a few key displines, some of which are more practical than spiritual, like time management and goal setting.  In my own study of spiritual discplines, I've found there are three areas that are the most crucial: personal devotions, self-examination and spiritual direction.  While Hughes has some things to say concerning devotions, there isn't much, if anything concerning the other two.        Hughes also discusses the discipline of "church."  A very interesting topic, and one where he tells us that the church is "the grandest institution that the world has ever known."  But this statement demonstrates that Hughes has bought into the lie that the church is an "institution."  So are prisons and mental hospitals.  The church was not founded to be a grand institution, but to be a life transforming force on this earth.  The fact that we have institutionalized the church to the point of irrelevance is why Christianity is becoming a passing fad in so much of the Western world.    As it is with the church so should it be with Christian books: they to need to help be agents of change and transformation, not just a list of do's and don'ts.  Sadly Hughes' book is more along the lines of a moral dictionary.  Such a book might be helpful for a brand new believer who wants a type of encyclopedia of all the different aspects of Christian culture, but there isn't much meat there for more advanced believers to chew on.  But even a new believer might be quickly overwhelmed with all the various disciplines that Hughes brings forth.   If you are looking for a book that will act as agent of transformation, I highly recommend any of the books John Eldredge has written, especially "Wild at Heart." and "Waking the Dead."  One of the best books about true inner transformation is John and Paula Sanford's "The Transformation of Inner Man."  And for a book about discipline as a means of transformation, I highly recommend Foster's classic "Celebration of Discipline."  And of course the best book of all in regards to transformation is any good translation of the Holy Bible.    Personally, I really like Pastor Hughes and think very highly of him.  I even agree with most of the points he makes in his book, but this is not one of his better efforts, to put it mildly.  So upon returning this book, I purchased a different one that Hughes can rightly be proud of: The Holy Bible: English Standard Version.  Hughes served as a member of the ESV Translation Oversight Committee.    "Superficiality is the curse of our age"  - Richard Foste 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 If you have been in the restaurant business for any length of time you do not need this book.  It does not cover anything new.  If you are looking for new ideas to satisfy your guests, or for details that you may be overlooking in quality service, this is not the book for you 
 Since this is the only Laos grammar book on the market, those of us who  are interested in learning are forced to use it.  The pages are not  formatted well, having an amatuerish feel to the layout.  The sentence  diagrams are very confusing and the print is small.  It takes a little  extra effort to learn the language simply because the book is not formatted  aesthetically.  Otherwise, the grammar is fine, although it is a must to  get the Lao-English Dictionary to implement what is learned in the grammar  book.  This book is the only game in town so we have to use it, but it  needs another edition to fix the layout 
 All the Care Bear merchandise is heavily marketed to preschool aged children but these "original" DVD's from the 80's are far from appropriate for that age group due to the evil scary content in every episode. The new care bear movie "Journey to Joke-a-Lot" is much more appropriate for young children 
 I purchased Eldredge's "Wild at Heart", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given "Waking the Dead" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.   John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like "The Matrix" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.   The author also presents the image of God as "my friend". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.   This is exactly the same theology as building the largest "Christian" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to "offend anyone". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.   Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of "setting hearts free". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not "free" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, "Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.   For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend "The Way of the Master" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.  
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 Lennon once made a comment to the effect that every two-bit hack associated with the Beatles would eventually get one book out of the deal, and in this case Kane is already on number two. Don't waste your time; if you want a real page-turner that brings up truly new insights, check out "The Beatles" by Bob Spitz, which is extremely insightful and well writen. I'm going to sell my copy of Kane's book: anyone interested 
 I am Zintkala Nuni, aka Lost Bird. I was given this name by my family in ceremony 1999. I was born and raised on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in North Central South Dakota. I have records to prove my name and my relationship to The Lost Bird of Wounded Knee. Renee never interviewed my family for her book. And from what my family has found out, all of the information about Lost Bird's mother in the book is untrue. I'm sorry for writing this BUT the truth must be known and I WILL be writing a book about my grandmother, Lost Bird, in the future to counteract the fiction that appears in this story. I hope someone reports this to Renee. I would love to speak with her and I'm sure my family would want to do the same. 
 This book is poorly researched, badly written and with a questionable selection of photographs. The cover photo basses are not even mentioned in the text! Only upside, a few rare photos from the fifties. Normally, you get what you pay for, so put your money into one of the more serious books on the subject. 
 This book has a lot of interesting history but really misses the point. The thing it might have considered is the rise of the Southern mass-delusion that, despite much evidence, slaves actually loved their masters, were happy and would fight for them. There is rather a dearth of information about what slaves actually thought. The amazing process where Southerners again deluded themselves into thinking that the Civil War was not about slavery but independence is adequately detailed. It is not also made particularly clear that what most people in the CSA were considering was really the exchange of slavery for serfdom. The argument among politicians was very lively but very few seem to have considered real freedom and equality. The word serfdom was not mentioned by contemporaries but Levine does give European parallels 
 This movie was terribly dissapointing.  The Other Side of Midnight is one of my all time favorites and I could not wait to see this movie.  The characters and story line are weak and unsophisticated compared to OSOM.  I loved Jane's business attire, she dressed to the T in this movie and the scenery in Greece and Venice were lovely and that's about it.  I would not watch this mini series again.  Jane Seymore was wonderful in "Somewhere in Time" 
 I hadn't heard of the book or the author before I picked it.   I read its first few pages and  Was hooked.  The main character, Cacciato [how do you pronounce this name?], decides to walk away from the Vietnam war and hike overland to Paris. His platoon follows him. The book describes their adventures.   The first quarter of the book contains some of the best combat narrative I have read, it describes the trauma, the randomness, the banality, the irritation of involuntarily living cheek-by-jowl with others.  This part for me flowed along. I was able to suspend disbelief about the fact that they were on a mission to track down one of their comrades who was walking into enemy territory.  Without giving the story away, there was a point where they came into contact with the Vietnamese enemy, where I gave up entirely.  The fiction had become magic realism, there was no going back to credibility and I'm afraid I lost the plot.   I did however persevere and finish, but I cannot recommend it based on my initial impressions.  The writing overall is excellent, the characters well-documented, but  I cannot follow when the plot doesn't have the pretence of credibility.   I would have liked to have liked this book more. 
 Too complicated to understand. Poor layout of the book. The way information is presented needs to improve a lot 
 Lots of "Sex" from SE Asia, some technically correct "tradescraft" items, BUT MOSTLY inaccurate bullsh*** in terms of actual intelligence and counterintelligence methods.  I would pay $2.00  JUST to have my intelligence insulted. $23.95 is outrageous to anyone with  ANY experience in either field 
 This book does not cover the new exams that have been revised as of September, 2002. Don't bother, wait for the next release 
 I had much anticipation of Butler's _Precarious Lives_ considering her position as one of the foremost cultural and literary theorists.  However, I was highly disappointed that the arguments she makes in the text are no greater than those of most academics, including those of grad students.  I'd wait for the paperback edition and buy it used as it is somewhat useful for citations.  Other than that, the argument is really over-stated these days and seems like much less than what one could or "should" expect from Butler 
 Look.  They got tired of trying to explain to their customers exactly what their products are and how they work, so they wrote a book to educate and sell them.  It's basically a hardback brochure.  I'm sure they give it to all their hot prospects.  But we the little people get to PAY for it.    There is some useful info on leading indicators but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere free.  And once they teach you which of their magic proprietary indicators to keep an eye on, guess what?  You're supposed to sign up for a subscription to get them, not even the simplest of the data is available free althought the book implies they are.   Booksellers need to stop carrying this kind of 'gotcha' book 
 I must respectfully disagree with the esteemed reviewers of this book listed above.  I expected so much more from a book with such a fine pedigree (Brookings and the US Council on Foreign Relations).  The topic of how states use financial instruments towards their foreign policy goals is an area which certainly requires more understanding.  As such, I expected this book to be an in-depth study of the various ways states have used such tools, and how the authors expect such tools to be used in the future.  I thus expected analyses of topics such as how states respond to currency crises of allies and enemies and how states use counterfeiting of enemies' currencies as foreign policy (i.e. as Iran is alleged to do with the US dollar).  I also expected a study of how states manipulate access to important currencies (as when the US cut Panama off from receiving dollars as part of an effort to topple Noreiga) and how they have sought to manipulate the foreign financial press (as is alleged to have happened during the classical Gold Standard era).    Some of these topics did receive  mention.  The issue of how the US should respond to allies' crises received good coverage, especially regarding South Korea.  There was also one paragraph acknowledging that countries have counterfeited others' currencies, and a brief discussion of petro-dollar recycling.  Moreover, I found the chapter on how interest groups have attempted to restrict access to US capital markets to further other goals very illuminating, and there was a nice summary of anti-terrorism finance legislation.  Overall, I found the first half of the book very enlightening.  Unfortunately, the other half of the book dealt predominantly with the authors' assertions that dollarization should be the way forward for developing countries to prevent currency crises, and in particular, that the US should encourage this and absorb some of the costs.  The issues of whether countries should use floating, dirty float, pegged or dollarized exchange rates is an important one.  However, I did not pick up this book to read about the authors' assertions about dollarization--I picked it up to read about financial statecraft.  Financial statecraft will only grow in importance, and as the authors note, it is critical that policymakers understand how it functions and what tools are at their disposal. This book only discusses financial statecraft primarily in its first 80 pages (and scattered in some places in the latter part of the book as well).  I feel eighty pages was just too little to adequately examine financial statecraft.  Instead, the reader is unfortunately left with a quick gloss-over of only a few aspects of such an important and under-analyzed topic 
 This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!! 
 After reading this book (very dry read, hard to finish), I had NAET over the course of several years with 3 different practitioners. I figured when it didn't work with the first one that it was their technique at fault, not the method.  After thousands of dollars, not covered by insurance, and absolutely zero results I gave it up. I had chronic back tension which I hadn't had before but no allergy relief. I did try Bowen work, which is a similar idea of opening the energy channels which doesn't involve the spine. After 10 sessions I could grow flowers again and have them in my house, after sneezing for 3 years solid. Another 10 sessions greatly reduced my asthma to managable levels. I didn't have further improvement, but by then I'd moved to another area and I think my Bowen worker had a different technique. I don't recommend this book 
 I absolutely agree with this review: "You will NOT get your moneys worth..., February 26, 2006"  We bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours.  We have the sable color, which I see is not sold this year... but I digress.  We have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it.  My biggest complaint is the steering.  The front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we're not on a smooth surface, it feels like I am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards.  I am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so I can get where I want to go.  Shopping is a joke with this stroller because I cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily.  The shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which, really, doesn't seem like the best way to keep a child's shoulders restrained.  It ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt.  This is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger, this got on my nerves.  The adult cup holder is a joke, so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid's cupholder out so it doesn't stay in any longer as well.  Oh, and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on.  SO FRUSTRATING!  Not a big deal, really, but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time.  I just remembered also, that the sides of the padding in the seat area, when I used this stroller with our Graco Snugride car seat,  would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely.  I would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area (the parts that say Aria) before I put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly.  If Peg Perego could fix the steering, I think I would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that I found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son 
 I ordered this book as a Christmas present for a budding novelist, and I also ordered a copy for myself.  When the "book" I had ordered for myself arrived and I found that it looked like a photocpy from Kikos, I was incredibly embarrassed to have given it as a Christmas present.  For the price I would have expected it to be bound or have stated otherwise in the descripion. I cannot believe I received this quality of product.  There is nothing that could be said in the content to compensate for this and I will never buy anything from this author again.  It is hard to believe anything he says when he can't really get his own book "published" 
 I can't believe how many people think this movie is a masterpiece. I had such high expectations of it and was extremely disappointed. When the film began I was interested for about 20 minutes, but then as it went on I started to have doubts. After a while I was debating whether or not to turn it off, but towards the end I decided to leave it on just to see how bad it was actually going to get. And it really did get bad! The ending was so predictible and hackneyed. It was just another crappy cops and robbers story, but with a high budget and an all-star cast 
 I have to agree with most of what's been said here.  I have two wonderful hand-reared black-tailed conures as pets - now this species is virtually unheard-of in captivity, so I bought this book on the strength of the 'detailed species descriptions' advertised.  What a slap in face!  Apparently my birds are simply 'similar to maroon-bellied conures, but ...not as interesting' (exact quotation).  The book is written from a breeder's point of view, and a breeder stuck two decades ago for that matter.  There is a strangely impersonal tone to the whole book, which some pet owners who don't see their birds as liquid assets may find off-putting.  I certainly did.  However, the many photos are good, which earns it the extra star 
 Dalrymple's argument is essentially that the poor have made many stupid choices. Of course some people make bad choices; this is obvious. But Dalrymple's diagnosis of the problems of the lower class are based on his experiences with convicted criminals and with psychiatric patients. What kind of book would he have produced if he worked with white-collar criminals and patients at a celebrity rehab center?  Dalrymple's brand of concern for the poor was parodied well by Charles Dickens in Hard Times: a wish that the poor would simply act like the well-off. Well-written, but as cruel as any other social darwinist tract 
 Mr. "Dow 36,000" wants you to believe him this time.  No, really, he means it.  Right.  In 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust.  I think that's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust.  This guy is amazing 
 Lets face it......if you know anything at all about developing land, the absolute critical item is actually finding a piece of property that makes sense to wast time pursuing. I bought this book hoping to find some insight into ways of "finding" that elusive "good fit" property that maybe I have not thought of. Nothing new here, just some odball potential sources of finding property that just waste your tim 
 I bought this set just for that movie and IT'S NOT ON HERE!! Why?! I am so mad 
 This is a dull and dry biography for such a colorful subject. Boring, circular descriptions and few interesting anecdotes. Not recommended 
 Does not do well at all in the digital cd system in my car.  Sounds horrible.  Needs remastering to conform to the new systems 
 500 pages of Win NT/2000 fundamentals in a SQL Server Architecture book. Come on, get real Ken Henderson.  Almost zilch in the way of diagrams makes for very heavy going.  I primarily bought the book to give me a total knowledge of SQL Server Architecture. I hadn't got far before I realised  that a high level description of the architecture was not going to be included because, according to the author, it had been covered in a previous book. Not good enough and I am asking the publishers for my money back.  Also, treatment of things like explanations of XML in a SQL Server Architecture book ?  The author has done what no IT system should do ... not adhered to requirements which in this case are to explain SQL Server and Internals.  All in all a disappointing experience 
 Save your money, this movie was a bomb.  If you like goofing on poor projects that take themselves too seriously, then by all means, reserve 87 minutes.  The star of this mess acts  and looks like Van Damme but simply  falls far short of the star of the original.  As for "Ogre" from  Revenge of the Nerds, I wanted to jump through the screen and fight him!   Like that chick would have went for him...give me a break! 
 I found this book to be ponderous and, in the end, unreadable.  I gave up on it with only 100 pages left to read - I cared that little about what was going to happen to the characters.  The book is now in the donation bin of my local public library 
 Unfunny other than the title, myopic,meandering and unfocused, visceral hate attempting to pass as humor. My own personal opinion after reading this book, and then watching Bill O'Reilly's program? Sweet Jesus, he is fair and balanced - no wonder the extreme wing of my Democratic party doesn't like him. He offers both sides of the story, and sometimes a third! What this book did was lead me to the realization and conclusion that the "lame stream" media is unfair, and unbalanced. I tried to give my used copy of this book to my local library and they refused the donation - "We don't condone hate" 
 I work in the construction industry as a secretary and I bought the Construction Dictionary for my desk so I could look up some of the more obscure words when I type letters and proposals.  This dicitionary is  really easy to read but the words are too basic.  It would be a good  dictionary for someone new to the business but if you need a more diverse  set of words this is not the dictionary for you.  It's priced right for the  beginner 
 I think I've burnt out on Jayne Ann Krentz.  The chemistry between her main character never sizzles, it just slow simmers.  And I'm so tired of her cliched characters: the cold, uptight, calculating, corporate male hero and the emotional/spiritual, free spirit heroine.  Tired, tired, tired.  On top of that, the plots are boring.  I give up on this author 
 This book is just plain TRASH and Lies! If the TRUTH is what you seek 'Nature's Eternal Religion' by:Ben Klassen is the book you for you 
 This is a strange little book.  The intention is good, love conquers all, dealing with aging, etc...  However,it is full of negative images, and frankly is...creepy.  When the boy is awake, he is exasperating, annoying, foul mouthed, and strange.  The only time the mother shows her love is by furtively entering her son's room and singing her little love ditty.  For what it's worth, my wife hates it too and refers to it as "The stalking story."  It has been unceremoniously pitched out of our house.  If you want a better rendition of this sort of thing, try The Runaway Bunny, or Guess How Much I Love You 
 I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.   While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.   He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them. 
 I've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe. However, in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday (blue with red and silver) is synthetic.  Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price, you receive a leather shoe! You are not "saving $50" if it's synthetic 
 i would just like to say that diane's recipies are not my personal favorites but whatever that marielle woman has to say is probably untrue.  that was rude 
 This book takes you where most books on marriage and relationship never take you.  One of the problems with "help and guidance" books is that most never really address the roots and foundations that experience and life are really built upon.  Mike addresses the essentials in a very artistic manner that draws you in and causes you embrace those mysterous truths about marriage and the relationship between a man and woman that most of us miss, unless we are willing to pursue the depths.  Include some "practical" books on marriage, but don't leave this one out of your "must read and apply" library 
 ...and that emptiness and boredom and blankness are the only emotions which author transferred to me as his reader through the medium of his words and it feels like a disease which is called "I am one of GenXers". While being not exactly the effect the author probably aspired to achieve by his novel, it perfectly matches with the true state of lives and feelings of the people like the ones acting roles in his story. And by this, the work proves the eternal unity of the art and real life, both always creations of the creator.. 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 Educational advice from an unrepentant Weatherman/bomber of the '60s.  Not worth the trees destroyed to print it.  Avoid unless you are a rabid socialist 
 Unless Amazon sent me the wrong one (i disposed of the wrapper before finding out) this model doens't even come close to fitting a Dell 15.4" screen. 
 As the product of a Catholic education, I really wanted to like this film, but I intensely disliked it. 90% of the reason that I disliked this film was because of the young actors. They are absoutely terrible and annoying actors playing terrible and annoying characters! They provoked no sympathy or empathy whatsoever for the characters they portrayed. 
 This would have been an interesting and original view of the problem of persistent poverty in the U.S. had it been published, oh, about thirty or thirty-five years ago.  As it is, it grossly oversimplifies a complex problem, and worse, plays to the cherished superstitions of neoconservative intellectuals and their `lumpen' readers alike.  It will probably come as a great surprise to the author, but I doubt poor black, Hispanic, and hell, even poor white kids have ever even heard of Norman Mailer, much less studied his essays in school.  It may also have escaped the author's attention that inflation whittled the value of payments from programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children down to a fraction of 1960's levels, even factoring in occasional cost-of-living increases-which had all but ceased starting in the 1980's.  Finally, under the impetus of a conservative Congress, the Clinton administration undertook reform of "welfare" in 1996 which included drastically tightening eligibility requirements, placing strict time limits on receipt of benefits, and actively directing recipients into jobs.  Yet poverty seems to persist despite the implementation of conservative nostrums and even more amazingly, despite a near-full employment economy at the end of the 1990's.  In other words, trying to blame everything on kids who grew their hair long in the 1960's, and vapid socialites hobnobbing with Bobby Seale at Leonard Bernstein's soirees forty years ago is not only not right-it isn't even wrong    Meanwhile, since the Nixon administration we have conducted a "War on Drugs" that has stuffed prisons full to bursting with (mostly low level) drug dealers and users-nearly all of them minorities--but accomplished very little else. Although crime rates have in fact dropped to historically low levels, this seems to have little if any correlation with incarceration rates, which have been relentlessly rising since the 1970's.  This decrease in crime, by the way, confounded neoconservative predictions at the beginning of the 1990's that crime-allegedly inspired by our evil culture-would continue spiraling upwards without letup.  Similar decreases occurred in out-of-wedlock births, but as an old saying goes, "A lady's reputation seldom improves."  Especially when she is a member of a racial minority, I might add.  It would seem that the underclass owes very little to the 1960's counterculture, although Encounter Books-once a source of urbane and intelligent works-would probably not have taken Mr. Magnet's manuscript had he concluded as much.  Neoconservatives, it turns out, are as rigidly locked into a mindless party line as the 1960's leftists they criticize.  For example, black social scientists such as Glen Loury and William Julius Wilson were clutched to neoconservative bosoms when their research found that blacks suffered relatively little racial discrimination in hiring compared to past decades.  They were dropped like hot potatoes however when their continued investigations showed that minority unemployment had a lot more to do with factors such as the virtual disappearance of even low-skilled work from most urban areas, and the lack of transportation to exurban areas where most job growth was.  Kind of makes blaming the 1969 Woodstock festival look silly, to say the least.  There is no doubt that there is something that was once called "the culture of poverty" that inculcates some of the poor with self-defeating attitudes and behaviors.  This was already old hat by the time "London Labor and London Poor" was published during the Victorian age.  Presumably, the Victorian poor did not become or remain so because of Janet Jackson displaying her bosom on television a century later.  There are innumerable other criticisms to be made of this book starting with its confusion of drug-taking behavior among the poor (which tends to seek oblivion from hopelessness) with middle-class drug taking behavior (which is usually risk-seeking or thrill-seeking), but a complete enumeration of its mistakes, misconceptions, and half-truths would take an essay nearly as long as the book itself.  Suffice it to say that instead of being random, the errors all seem to point in a certain political direction.  Readers may conclude what they will about the author's presumed good faith from this.  Those looking for `just-so-stories' to confirm their darkest prejudices towards racial minorities and justify doing nothing will certainly find what they seek in this book.  Those looking for nuanced discussions aimed at trying to solve problems instead of finding scapegoats will have to look elsewhere 
 This book is nothing but a shameful and disguised attempt (notwithstanding his denials) to discredit Democratic voters and to advocate the enactment of "election reform" laws that will disenfranchise voters, while at the same time ignore and dismiss the greatest threat to our democracy today - the privatization of our elections with corporate owned electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software and leave no paper trail for auditing them.  To be more specific:  The book is filled with purported examples of illegal voters, ignoring the fact that this problem accounts for a small minority of election fraud in our country today.  To remedy this problem, Fund advocates several measures that will do little to remedy the problem, while disenfranchising millions of voters, mostly those who are poor or non-white and most likely to vote Democratic.  Here are just three examples, among the many cited in Funds book: 1) Disallowing homeless people to vote because they don't have a proper address; 2) Requiring a picture ID to vote - which 10% of the population lack, and which amounts to a poll tax for the poor; 3) Abolishing the extending of voting hours in situations where insufficient allocation of voting machines results in as long as 10 hour waits to vote (again, this is a problem faced mainly in poor and minority neighborhoods).     But whereas Fund is so concerned that an occasional illegal voter may slip through the cracks in our system, when it comes to electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software, although admitting that mistakes are sometimes made, he claims that these machines cannot be used to steal elections.  To prove this point he does nothing more than quote a man who works as a PR consultant for Diebold - although Fund is Careful not to mention this fact.      
 i was disappointed, many who i talked to recommended the Lorna Sass pressure cooking books. 90+% of the recipes were made with foods I would never consider eating. so for my family there may be 5 or 6 recipes that i would consider trying. if its made with foods they won't eat, then this cookbook was not meant for me. That's my opinion and i would guess that others find it very useful for them, but not for me 
 This is a book that focuses on slavery as a system of paternalism.  It tries hard but in its efforts reduces slaves to one dimensional caricatures who have bought into and welcome the system of slavery.  I read this in college and the way slaves were described as being invested in this system seemed even then such a shallow stereotypic view.  He seems to forget that being owned by someone with absolute power over their existence has an effect on how slaves acted.  We have modern examples of this (Stockholm's Syndrome) and how life threatening situations can change you psychologically and impact your view of your oppressors.  African-American history is too important to ignore and there are books out there that are well researched and give a more complete picture of the realities of slavery; exploring the impact of this system on the people enslaved while not buying into paternalistic stereotypes.    Some titles worth reading:  Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion by Peter H. Wood   Slave Resistance and Early African American History by Peter P. Hinks  To Awaken My Afflicted Brethren:  David Walker and the Problem of Antebellum Slave Resistance by Peter P. Hinks  Both Wood and Hinks are excellent historians. I took a class with Peter Hinks in college the major focus of his scholarship is on slave resistance and in class he argued that Walker's appeal was not only important on its face but because it was widely circulated by both free and enslaved Africans that it inspired plans for insurrection maybe even Vesey's plan.  Labor of Love Labor of Sorrow by Jacqueline Jones  Jones has a good history of African-American Women focusing on slavery and reconstruction but at times it drags.  Writings of former slaves and freedmen:  David Walkers Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World by David Walker  The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa the African by Olaudah Equiano  Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Jacobs  Slave Narratives (Library of America) by William L. Andrews and Henry Louis Gates  Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass by Fredrick Douglass    Nothing can compare to reading autobiographic accounts of those who were forced to endure slavery, all of the above are excellent; the only exception above is David Walker's Appeal (it is not an auto-biography) it is a political and spiritual indictment of slave owners and a call for the enslaved to rise up against this immoral paternalistic system in the name of God.  Walker was an uncompromising radical political voice at a time when it was extremely unhealthy.  I think this book (Roll Jordan Roll) is o.k. but hopefully the suggestions given for other options will either or supplement this dated choice or replace it. 
 Basically this book is an elaborate defense of promiscuity and hedonism.  I have liked his other books in the past (Skinny Legs and All is one of my all-time favorites) but this one didn't have enough insight to adequately place the elements of the story within a greater understanding of the world around us (usually one the greatest things about his writing. 
 The author covers a lot of ground in a very limited number of pages.  The result is a lack of a general biographical sketch of Washington.  I would agree with other reviews that a more comprehensive biography would be a better choice for a first read on Washington.  
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book really did nothing for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big TD Jakes fan, I think he's definitely an anointed prophet from God, and he's a fantastic minister. But being a great minister doesn't necessarily make a person a great writer. He's blessed w/ an uncanny ability to preach and teach on healing and deliverance from life's painful experiences, but when it comes to putting this thoughts on paper, he just doesn't seem to be able to get his points across clearly, directly and succinctly. For example, he doesn't stay focused on the subject at hand because of his excessive use of metaphors, hyperbole and superfluous information throughout this book. A good writer uses metaphors only to set an example or to illustrate a significant point in order to paint a clear picture in the reader's mind, not use them in every other sentence. For a while there, I wasn't sure if I was reading a book by TD Jakes or Dr. Seuss.  Another problem I have w/ this book is that it seems like it is addressing little boys or, at best, men who have failed at every kind of human relationship possible - i.e., husband/wife, son/father, father/son, male/male friends, male/female friends, etc. He does however, provide a great outline on man's various relationships (with himself, with God, with his children, etc.), but his delivery is so out of focus. In fact, he even devotes an entire chapter smack in the middle of the book about money and finances. What does that have to do w/ how I deal w/ my "He-Motions"? Besides, he's already written a book a few years ago entitled "The Greatest Investment-Faith, Family & Finance", therefore it was unnecessary to bring up the subject of money/finance again in "He-Motions".  The info contained in this book is just too elementary for me. He doesn't offer any real soultions on dealing w/ my "He-Motions", and the examples he provides just don't deal w/ anything that I have ever dealt with personnally. I was really expecting something much deeper and substantive. But all I got here was a bunch of fluff. C'mon Bishop, enough of the lame stories and metaphors, give us some substance. I don't mean to sound too critical, but I'm just not feelin' this book. 
 This movie should be shown to classrooms of aspiring screenwriters and directors as an example of how not to be sucked into the Hollywood junk machine. The screenwriter of this movie obviously had some ideas about a coherent story that he wanted to tell about moral relativity and corrupt military officials. This film's story structure is mostly influenced by the classic film Rashomon. Well, so what happened? How did this ungracious disaster of a movie make it to the big screen? The biggest culprits are easily the movie stars, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, using their bloated star egos to force the screenwriter to rework his material into something they ultimately found more suitable to their star personas. Disgusting! Travolta was supposed to be a bad guy and Jackson was supposed to bite the bullet, but no way would the two Hollywood jerks allow that!  SPOILER ALERT: Who in their right mind was surprised by the ending? I knew Sam Jackson was in on it from the get go and soon enough he would grace us with his presence. Lo and behold, his bald head emerges at the end of the movie wearing a white outfit like an angel of some sort. I hate this movie, it's an insult to the audience! John McTiernan, ( Predator, Die Hard ), the director of Basic should be ashamed of such a lackluster effort on his part. But what could he do when faced with the two morons who played the leads! A sad joke of a movie, avoid it unless you just love junk 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 This book is a republication of what appears to be "modern" methods of the 1950s.  By the data, illustrations, tools and materials described in this book I conclude that the republication was not updated to  the methods of the 1990s.  For example, data quoted is from 1957 through  1960, the term "vinyl" is not used and the material is not  described, and all tacking is literally done with tacks and not staples. If  you are looking for a book to understand the methods of the past, then this  is it.  But don't expect to learn about truly modern methods and materials 
 The book came to me severly damaged before it was even packaged.  The first 313 pages were severly gouged out of the bottom pages about 1/4" deep x 1/2" x 1/2" (inches), close to the spine.  I did not have time to return it because my course started Jan. 10, 2006 and the Delivery estimate was:  January 6, 2006 - January 10, 2006.    I am very disappointed with this product and purchase 
 American Juniors are just wannabe's of S Club 8! They take their songs, and sing them horribly! They also took some S Club 7 songs. American Juniors can't even BEGIN to compare themselves to S Club 7. These kids have some potential, but they really need to get their own music. Check out S Club 8/S Club Juniors and S Club 7 for the original songs, which are actually performed well 
 Harry Bosch has retired from the LAPD and obtained his private investigator's license just to cover his bases.  But it is his old work that has the strongest draw for him.  A homicide case that he worked four years prior to his retirement remains unsolved and haunts his dreams.  But as he starts to open old files and uncover old secrets, he finds that there are many different people that do not want Harry prying into their pasts.  But old habits die hard and the detective in Harry follows the trail of clues despite the strong warnings against doing just that.  What he finds is a complicated web of crimes and cover-ups that are destined to lead Harry to nothing but danger.  It has been a while since I have read any of the Harry Bosch novels and I do not think I'll be back.  Unfortunately, watching the movie of Blood Work and seeing Clint Eastwood play Harry ruined the character for me and I could not help but picture Clint as the star of this book - which is not a positive as I am not a fan of Clint.  On top of that, the story was convoluted and contrived and at the end, magically wrapped up over night by the fantastic Harry Bosch.  I don't know if this book was simply a weak note for Michael Connelly or if it just did not resonate with me, but it was disappointing enough to end the series for me 
 If I had not read numerous books on this subject - one of the best is the `Limits to Growth' series by MIT - I would be very skeptical of Heinberg's assertions because of his obvious bias against Western Civilization.  However, after reading over a dozen books on essentially the same subject, I believe most of his assertions about the future are correct; namely that due primarily to population pressures and the necessities of civilization, the entire world is headed for an inevitable collapse.   I believe the author ruins what could have been a great book with comments such as "The Earth cannot afford rich people ..." (page 178)" and "A small minority ... [who] think critically - will gradually come to the conclusion that the entire system of industrial civilization is inherently unsustainable" (page 183).  I believe it's obvious to any serious student of history that civilization, if not requires, at least inevitably produces, wealth, i.e. "rich people", and given certain restrictions this is a good thing. And his assertion that "industrial civilization is inherently unsustainable" is patently absurd. It does seem that the current flavor of western industrial civilization, with its blind pursuit of growth at any/all costs, is headed for collapse, yet I can imagine dozens of flavors of industrial civilization which are sustainable.  On the other hand, I very much appreciated his analysis of why the real culprit, over population, is not, and will not, be discussed in any way that matters.  So if a reader can get past Heinberg's political ideology, this is a great book.  P.S. The author provides many valuable references to books and web sites. 
 I'm rating this 2 stars primarily because of the incomplete nature of the project. It's not just that the code samples won't compile, or are so disorganized as to be nearly worthless. Much more irritating are the constant references to code samples that simply don't exist. Time and again the author(s) refer to sample programs that can be 'downloaded from the books web site'. These programs do not exist. The authors lame explanations for the lack of a CD (cost, etc) lose all credibility when one comes to the realization that the likely reason a CD doesn't exist is because the vast majority of the sample programs referred to in the text don't exist, either. Any hope that new code samples my someday appear on the book site seems futile as well - the site hasn't been updated in a year and a half. One is left with the feeling that this is clearly a project that was shipped when only partially completed. I feel ripped off; taken advantage of.  On the plus side, portions of the book are well written and informative. It is, in spite of it's shortcomings, one of the better books I've found for explaining a variety of GL techniques commonly used in games. It's a shame it doesn't live up to it's promise; if the authors had been a little more diligent in completing the project before publishing it, it could have been a world-beater. Instead it's just another slightly below average dissapointment.  I also have a real problem with the fact that the author is writing reviews (typically 4 star ratings) for books that his own organisation is involved in publishing. If that isn't a conflict of interest I don't know what is. I feel Amazon compromises their credibility by allowing clearly non-objective 'reviews' to be listed with the books. If the author wants to write a little blurb, thats fine, but don't let them rate products they have a financial interest in 
 This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it.  Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly.  However, the ending really killed it for me.  It's too unnecessarily long.  Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah.  I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment.  But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book.  Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end 
 I heard the author on a podcast and thought that what he had to say was interesting and relevant to identifying and changing self-defeating behaviors in a work environment. I think that the behaviors that he identifies in each chapter are relevant self-defeating behaviors and the writing is clear. However, I have been disappointed with this book for several reasons. Firstly, I think that the remedies proposed for each behavior are superficial prescriptions. For example, effetive delegation requires not just identifying a task to be delegated, but a multi-step process of identifying the task, explaining the task to the delegee, getting mutual agreement on what needs to be done, the time  to complete the task, the resources availalble to complete it, and the expected standards at completion. No such framework is laid out. This is true of all the chapters in the book. Secondly, this would not be so bad if the author pointed the reader at other books or resources to flesh out these ideas. However, the book has no index and no bibliography or suggested references. This is an unpardonable sin in publishing, to my mind. No references and no index bespeaks a book rushed to market. Either that, or it's a tactic to get the author to consult to companies to give the specific information on how to remedy the behaviors.   I hope some of these criticisms can be addressed if there is to be a second edition of the book. 
 No plot...hard to understand...a total snore fest...If u care about whoever Carlos Fuentes is writing about...go ahead, read it...but don't blame me if you fall asleep...horrible...horribl 
 It has the potential to be a great book if the author had taken some time to actually look into each breed. The "Canadian Eskimo Dog" is now referred to as the Canadian Inuit Dog out of respect for the Inuit people. He has the dog's height wrong, and the weight range is much too high. This leads me to conclude that if there were that many errors on one dog breed, who's to say that it's not wrong on other breeds too?  I was quite disgusted and mad to see the "designer dogs" put as purebred dogs. Labradoodles, Bichon/Yorkies, Cockerpoos, and Bull Boxers are NOT purebred dogs. They are mixes given a fancy name and sold for staggering amounts of money.  The first few chapters on the history of the dog is quite fascinating though, and the pictures are nice. If you need an all-in-one book and don't mind many errors, this is a great book for you. If you're like me, go down the road of buying a better dog encyclopedia and different books on different subjects rather than this faulty all-in-one 
 There is alot of information in this book. Pretty much everything you would ever need to do to a research paper on any book in the N.T. Only it is very wordy, with long and redundent sentences and I made the mistake of reading this book in my bed, hence it will make you fall asleep. 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the "strongest/purest" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 "perfect" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.  Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with "the deathbed edition" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.   I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.   To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The "true" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers.. 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 You could remix this stench with Jesus as the engineer and you still would come up with a pile of gargage! It stunk then, it stinks now, and always will be the black cloud that hangs over his very very mediocre solo career 
  This film should have it all, it's the story of a great show woman, close friends with the greatest of show men, Noel Coward.  It had a large budget, a potentially great leading Lady, great costumes and a whole plethero of original Lawrence stage numbers, "Poor Jenny" is particularly striking. But somehow none of that is enough to either utilise Andrews to her full potential nor to tell the story of Gertrude Lawrence with the right amount of truth and razzmatazz.  Andrews was largely blamed for it's failure at the time but this seems so wrong, essentially it is problem of script, Gertie's struggle with alcohol is only hinted at. Coward's homosexuality is completely glossed over and Gertie's illness and subsequent death at 50, from cancer, is not even eluded to!  Here lies the problem I feel, how on earth can you set the screen alight with the story of a sensational life if you only tell the bits of the story you think the audience will tolerate?  You need to let the audience be the judge of what they can take and they clearly hated this! A shame and a wasted opportunity 
 I found the characters stilted and unbelievable.  These are supposed to be "REAL" people? It is just my opinion but my copy goes up for sale today 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Very loud, very slow - takes almost as long to inflate as when using a foot pump 
 I found this story to be extremely elementary.  This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance 
 Yeah...this book basically seems to follow Dan Browne's to the letter. I had to laugh at another review of it, especially this line: "This is the only [commentary on The Da Vinci Code] written from a balanced, secular point of view."  As if a secular point of view is any less biased regarding God/religion than a religious one is. Hilarious.  If you want to know more, go for the Tony Robinson series on the Real Da Vinci Code, especially when he wants to excavate under the church. Brilliant stuff 
 The title is completely misleading.  I purchased this book and software from Broderbund, after reading the reviews posted here at Amazon, believing the book and software would help me covert PDF files that I could not Save or print in its orginal format into ones I could. I can say for sure,in my opinion, the other reviews of this book led me down the "fools primrose path." Perhaps I should have read the reviews more carefully. Of course the fault is entirely mine 
 This is one of the worst books I've read!  It was poorly written, (lot's of type-o's).  I also did not like the authors writting style.  (he jumps around topics too much).  I have read a lot of IT Books this last year and a half(over 50) and this is the first book I came across that I had to write a review about.  I caution you if thinking about buying this book.  The book I am reading now is Data Network Design 2nd Edition (reprint by Mcgraw-Hill copyright 2000 and it says it contains select material from this book)  I don't know maybe McGraw-Hill screwed it up royally because the other reviews I've read are all high marks 
 I found this book to be glib, disrespectful, and pseudo-historical.  I could not escape the over-riding and simplistic theme that all Native Americans are good, all European invaders are evil.  Ex.  On page 14, Christopher Columbus is referred to as "Chris" Columbus, and is labeled a "Johnny-come-lately".  Ex. On page 22, It is claimed that in 1754, George Washington led a raid that killed a French diplomat, which led to a defeat at Fort Necessity.  Here the author feels it appropriate to quip, "first battle, first defeat", as if to impugn the first great general and president of the United States of America.   If you like your history written by an author who believes that people living in previous generations should have their actions judged using today's ethical standards, than you will be fine with this book.  This style of writing is easy and fashionable. If, however, you are looking for historical facts presented in their appropriate historical context, I believe you will find this book lacking 
 I thought that perhaps I was losing my hearing.  I looked (in vain) for subtitles to see if that would help.  My partner assured me that no, my hearing was fine, the audio on these DVD's is woeful.  Then I started to have episodes of deja vu.  Or maybe jkust episodes that were on The Complete Season One were included in this.  Huh?  Very strange.  I won't buy again until they do something about the audio.  It is headache enducing 
 I think this is possibly the most overrated series I have ever read. Since I seem to be alone in this thought, let me explain.    1) There is little to no narrative drive. Adams intrigues the reader with some interesting narrative points early on, but never actually gets to finishing the point, leaving the reader wondering why there is no resolution (was he bored when he wrote? or is he just sloppy? probably the latter).  2) There is little cohesion to bind the five part trilogy together. It's really just one random story after another. In fact,it's not really a story--it's more an extended TV series in which the writers make up plot points as they write (a la Alias). Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.  3) Only the first book seems to be truly good. After that, it goes downhill. Unfortunately, the first book, ending without a conclusion such as it is, only makes the reader want to read further, which upon completion of reading further,the reader becomes disappointed that the further reading was not as good as the initial reading, which in turn makes the initial reading not as good as initially thought. Conclusion: overrated series.  It is however, somewhat funny. Hence, the two stars 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 I found the book very confusing.  The author leaps from past pirate adventures to modern day Jimmy Buffett and back.  I have had this book for over a year and have not been able to get past page 50.  When Jimmy urges  Mr. Eng not to continue the book, I think it was more for the reader's sake  and not for his own.  Fins Up 
 It does not work unless sunrays fall directly on it. I wouldn't suggest this product 
 This was assigned for entering 9th graders as summer reading. The story of a dysfunctional family (alcoholism, child abuse) is maudlin enough on it's own. The author apparently thinks that teenagers need to be exposed to graphic sex and X-rated language to relate to the dilemmas of growing up. I found the story tedious, the language unimaginative and the message simplistic. Skip this one 
   So first this book tells girls to stay chaste until they're married, and then it gives you "sexy" make-out and bj tips!?! I don't get it, not suitable for under 18 
 Every once in a while I come across a book that begs the question: why was this book ever written?  Steve Fraser's "Every Man A Speculator" is one such book.  While it purports to explain the impact of Wall Street in American life, it never reaches this lofty plateau.  It is a regurgitation of stories told about Wall Street figures, stories told by other people much better.  It assumes you already know what Wall Street consists of and the difference between what Wall Street actually is and what people assume is Wall Street.  I won't go into what I had hoped this book would be and failed utterly at because that would be unfair.  Let's just say that the research behind this book is second rate and that there is no analysis whatsoever.  In fact, there is nothing new whatsoever in this book 
 I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it 
 I was cooking 5 strips of bacon on the platter in the microwave and the platter actually cracked in half! I have cooked bacon on my other platters with no problem. This is dangerous and annoying. I couldn't find Sango customer service anywhere, therefore, had to return to retailer, etc. 
      "The best work of fiction to come out of the Vietnam War"?  "This is the way it was"?  Due to the tremendous reviews, I sought long and hard for this book.  I was truly disappointed.  I found the book hard to read and had to force  myself to finish the book. Fortunately, the latter part of the book dealing with the return home was more captivating.  There are many, many more worthwhile works of fiction on the Vietnam War.  I would not recommend this one.  Try James Webb's "Fields of Fire".  I also liked his post-war fiction "Lost Soldiers" 
 Only a short way into this book, I quickly realized General Clark wrote the book himself without the help of a ghost writer.  It appears he also lacked the help of a good editor. The story jumps around from thought to thought without solid editorial orginization.  Aside from the poor organization of the book, the content has some shortcomings as well.  It is extremely self serving and bears little objectivity.  I found it disturbing to read that Clark viewed his role as Commander of NATO more seriously than his role as a United States Army Officer.  He does not atempt to hide the fact that he entered the US into a war directly against the wishes of his civilian superior.  This book makes it clear why Secretary Cohen and General Shelton are not supporting his bid for President and question his integrity.  Due to his presidential bid this book is being removed from the Army's Command and General Staff reading list.  This is unfortunate despite its poor style because the book serves as a cautionary tale of the possibility to abuse the powers currently resting in the US military unified command structure 
 i am very displeased with this purchase because i have not received this book bought and paid for with the other books that i purchased and bought.  if i do not receive any response as to why i have not gotten this book, i will file a complaint with the BBB, Consumer Protection, and Federal authorities 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my Rebel XT.  Amazingly, I find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit.  I find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless I correct the exposure using the menu.  Would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430EX are better, but I cannot recommend this one 
 What is up with this author?    Dus he think it is helpful for kids to reed buhks were all the words are miss spelt?  I dont no about u but how is this spose to help kids lern to reed?  Yes, that is literally how the author writes the prose in this book.  If you think your child should read language like this at an age when they are trying to learn to read and to write in proper English, more power to you -- it's your choice.  I for one was appalled.  
 MY MOM FIGURED OUT FINDHORN A LONG TIME AGO - GOT SOME INFO FROM THE DEPT OF AGRICULTURE IN SCOTLAND AND FOUND THAT THE GROUND FINDHORN SITS ON IS PERFECT FOR GROWING ANYTHING.  IN MY OPINION, THE WHOLE OPERATION IS A FAKE 
 There are some nice things to say about this album.  It was actually the 1st "gothic" CD I ever bought at hot topic and listened to it right away.  Now that I have several other pieces by different artists, I am noticing that there is something missing from this. A certain pizazz.... I like it, but don't listen to it much anymore 
 Chargers work great and are a great bargain.  However, the generic "LG" driver software that comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesn't have an authenticity signature.  I don't know about other computers, but mine with Windows XP (SP2) won't accept it 
 Uses an absurd amount of ink. printed 3 sheets of 8X10 photos one CD and about 15-20 documents and ran out of ink not just one or two Cartridges but ALL six. customer service ay Epson is awful e-mail went unanswered so i called, tried to explain how much ink i was going thru and how the printer would clean the ink heads before every print job but was told that was normal. i don't know if the printer was defective or not, but i do know that epson customer support is. retuned and bought a cannon mp600 and i love it!!! 
 The only interesting points in this book have ALL been covered by other authors and with better prose and evidence. The original thoughts posed here about the Ark and Temple Electronics are so ridiculous that I felt someone was playing a joke on me.   In this day and age when we can pick up a cell phone and speak to an astronaut in orbit even though we do not have interstellar travel we are expected to believe that an orbital communication system built by beings who were capable of interstellar flight was radioactive?!? Please. If the author had tried to convince me that there were weapons involved in the Ark and the Temple then it may have made a little more sense.  I have to admit that I skimmed large portions of the book because it was boring me to tears. I wasted my money. 
 Normally I enjoy reading Danielle Steel books but I found this one to be way off base and I could barely stand to finish it.  I found that the romance between Gabbie and the priest to be awful and the fact that he killed himself over it to be worse.  The priest and Gabbie were both weak and that would not happen like that in real life I do not believe.  Their whole romance was one of the worst things I have ever read.  Then the ending of the book was horrible also how can she fall in love with someone whom she hardly knows and has never seen outside of a hospital talk about a violation of the doctor patient relationship! The ending of the book left a lot to be desired I would not recommend this book to anyone after reading the whole book 
 I hate the fact that this "group" has "made it" simply because some a-hole at the record company never heard of "Massive Attack." I swear I gave this album a good-hard listen: just me and a pair of headphones hoping for something new.  What I heard was a girl who has a good voice, but lends that voice to some of the dumbest recycled lyrics that I keep hearing over and over on the radio. (now, the radio isn't bad, but aren't you tired of hearing the same lyrics re-arranged to a different peice of music?) It also wouldn't be so bad if I didn't already love Massive Attack and never heard of them. SERIOUSLY go listen to "Mezzanine" From Massive Attack and tell me that Evanescence isn't HEAVILY influenced and to a point copying them. Don't just rip my review just because "I LOVE THAT SONG THEY PLAY ON THE RADIO" go get Mezzanine, sit in a dark room and just listen. You'll see that I'm right. also, the album cover? please. come up with graphics, or something. I hate ego maniacs that put their damn face all over their cover. 
 I would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. The picture quality was not good at all. I previously owned another Kodak camera with the same Megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better. Just after a year of using the Kodak C300 camera, it stopped working and I did not use it that much. I now own the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great pictures, I haven't had any problems with it and I have been using it on an almost daily basis since May 2006 
 Truth-be-told, I hated "HAVING" to give this magazine even one star, but that was the least I could do via this rating system. This magazine has some good writers but needs a new editor. Mr. Shoaf is very bad at his job, clearly, and seems to use and reuse the "buddy system" in using writers. Perhaps he gets a kickback? At any rate, this is, overall, a cruddy example of journalism. My facts tell me it should fall under fiction rather than nonfiction in many issues. I am done with it. Get a new editor and perhaps I will reinvestigate the publication. Until then, so long. I have no time for absolute rubbish 
 I have had to un-install and reinstall three times and it still won't update on a very current Windows XP version. I hate how hard it is to download from my bank and it never recognizes the stuff anyway so I have to go through line by line and create aliases. I like Quicken better but the accountant can't figure out how to import Quicken into his Quickbooks Pro so here it is. Hate it, hard as ever not easier, the whole thing takes way too long to work with. Reports are a bit easier which is good or I would have tossed it out the window and bought Microsoft Money 
 I purchased this for my wife for Christmas.  I installed it shortly after and it worked fine for about 10 weeks.  Now it sounds like the fan is about to fall out.  Must be poor quality materials 
 Bring it on Again, was a terrible movie. With a title so closely related to another movie called, Bring It On, the movie gave off a false representation. It was misguiding and left you believing that it would take off where the last one left off. It also gives the sense that it was a low budget movie just trying to feed off the hype from the original. Although, with its lack of excitement and catchy tunes, that Bring It On had, it couldn't follow in its "big sister's" shoes.	   	Bring It On Again was also lacking in its confusing storyline and its unknown actors. The movie jumps around from one point of time to another, leaving a disappointment when it randomly ends. However, they got it right when Bring It On was filmed. The movie flowed just right and made it fun to watch. With Kristen Dunst, Gabrielle Union, and Eliza Dushku playing the perky cheerleader roles, it all fit perfectly.  	 	This movie also needed more involvement with the audience. There was no exciting music or catchy cheers that everyone would find themselves repeating just hours later.  The original movie had girls all over singing their cheers including: " I'm Sexy I'm Cute I'm Popular To Boot," and "Burr It's Cold In Here." Which kept the audience up and moving.   There also wasn't as many exciting cheers and competitions throughout this movie like the first one. For instance; Bring It On, involved regional and national competitions, while Bring It On Again only consisted of a cheer-off between two teams within the college. What would any cheerleading movie be without any competitions?  	Bring It On Again, was not at all what it was made up to be. It was slow and boring at times, and just couldn't keep up with the original. Which is why this film should go in the hall of shame. 
 Tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds.  I am invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index as well as other index funds, but this is a bit too much.  If you understand the concept of indexing, save some cash and skip this book 
 I didn't buy this for myself, it was a gift.  Honestly I doubt I would have purchased it for myself because I wanted a *serious* pepper grinder.  I use my grinder every day and I like a lot of pepper.  I found this grinder to be a pain because of how light the output was-- I had to sit there squeezing for what felt like ages.  In addition, the grind isn't adjustable, although it was supposed to be.  Finally, the handle simply broke off one day.  I didn't drop it or anything.  I guess it's not for serious use.  
 The Sivulkas' work is a rather long narrative of American advertising -- with very little to offer beyond reproductions of some rather commonplace ads from the last two hundred years.  Much of the information they offer seems to come from other sources, and there is no real bibliography to the book. It is most misleadingly titled "cultural history" since there is so very little to the book beyond a chronology, and that is full of mistakes, over-simplifications, and such bland statements that there is nothing to be learned from this book. Others have written much better and more meaningful  things about the history of advertising, and charged less than [$$] for it 
 The writing is good from a technical standpoint (I don't have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well).  The idea is a good one too.  What I can't get past is the character Robert Langdon.  Langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second.  Another thing I have trouble with is Dan Brown's knack for slowing the pace of the story.  Things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense.  The problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff.  Like playing fetch with a dog, you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest, especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it's finally tossed.    This book is an easy read but I think it is a bit over-rated.  
 I had a crush on a chick that liked this cd....then i found out how she was....hmmm oh yeah slut! anyway yeah garbage good thing i never considered buying or downloading any of her music....oops she did it again create a garbage. Oh and to add on for my not so well absent minded avril lavigne fan. "which sucks" she bought the cd and got spyware on her computer.....thanks again britney!!!  P.S: Another girls gone wild britney and madonna....lma 
 I was surprised that the authors used such a significant amount of material from Atul Nerkar.  He has been widely discredited given his unorthodox teachings at Columbia, and few if any of his peers have bought into his lines of reasoning.  While some of the material in the book was thoughtfully presented, one must question the author's judgment in drawing upon sources such as Nerkar 
 Steven Seagal drops yet another classic on the film world with 'Out For A Kill'.  Seagal stars as an overweight but super-sexy professor named Robert Burns.  He's an expert in ancient Chinese relics and is in China doing some excavation and cataloging of newly found antiques.  Unbeknownst to him, the people who hired him are using him to move drugs out of the country.  Boy, did these wacky Chinese drugdealers pick the wrong professor to screw with.  The Lord is arrested and sent to a Chinese prison, leaving his mailorder Russian bride all alone.  He's in prison for an undisclosed amount of time, but due to the editing it seems like he was in lockdown for about twenty minutes.  He is released through some stringpulling by the American government to use him as a pawn to lure out the drugdealers.  Little do these dealers know, but Lord Steven was once the most feared theif in China.  So, the dealers decide that Steven needs to be eliminated so they blow up his house.  Only the Lord isn't inside but his Russian wife is.  He gets pissed, swears revenge, and hilarity ensues.  'Out For A Kill' is pretty much pure crap.  The plot is ridiculous and very vague.  The fight scenes are pretty sad(especially when Seagal fights a small Chinaman who happens to know some sort of monkey kung fu).  There are numerous useless characters:  the black dude Seagal befriends in prison who the filmmakers lead you to believe will have something to do with the plot later on but actually is never heard from again.  And also there are the two DEA agents who do nothing more than show up to find the bodies of Seagal's victims and say lame crap like "He moves like a ghost".  I died at that one.  He doesn't even come close to moving like a ghost.  All he did was lumber his tubby ass out the door.  Hilarity.  Anyways, 'Out For A Kill' sports a lame script, pathetic acting, sad fight scenes, absolutely putrid dialogue, and a vast sheen of vagueness.  This one is for hardcore Seagal fans only and even they won't like it.  Watching this movie is like getting fingerbanged by your grandfather:  you may want to enjoy it, but its just uncomfortable 
 Is this what it's come to?  I am just in shock.  Apparently doctors have to publicly endorse vaccinations these days or be regarded as kooks.   These doctors need to delve into the large body of knowledge regarding vaccines and their wide-ranging and often serious adverse health effects (from aluminum and mercury in the preservatives, from viral contaminants that irrefutably cause cancer, from provoking unnatural overblown immune response in newborns, etc.) that these doctors either 1) have neglected to do ANY homework about the vaccination issue, or 2) are scared to say what they know in public.    Either way, shame on you!!!  We need more advocates for NATURAL HEALTH in our children and in our society 
 We all have different taste and I am trying to consider this. But to me this is just another artist who had a strange idea and we are bying it and help him to live a good life. Nickelodeon and even the Disney channel featuring him. My little girl and I listened to two songs that they played on the Disney channel over and over.Malti is the song she really started to listen to. Honestly. The only reason why that song is so great is Barbara's voice and singing ability. Dave can't sing and shouldn't even try to sing in Spanish. The tune is catchy and we find us humming along. SO I ordered this CD. What a joke. Most of the time you can't evne understand what he is saying and it is not as if he came up with new songs. He has the known children songs for the most part and just puts his own twist on it. But it is not entertaining for little ones.My daughter keeps asking: What is this? Till Malti comes on and then she and I are relieved and hum along with joy and glee. Thank you Barbara for saving this song. I even bought another CD thinking perhaps I just got a bad one and the next are better. I am disappointed with that one as well. So you take a song like Somewhere over the rainbow and put a new rythm on it. Wopee. I like it but it isn't worth it to me and I admit I have no idea or clue who this artist is and where he came from and what his background is but honestly.. he is overrated and sold. There is a song with Cheryl Crow on it. Okay. SO I am thinking this will be fun perhaps. Only to find that I want to shake him and her for again not putting some fun and step and pep into a song. I guess I am not a alternative and don't appreciate the earthy balance the musicians bring to the music. I want some rythm and clap your hands together and sing along type of music for my children. This type of stuff is something a teenager can appreicate later on only that the songs are too young for them at that time. My children have NO clue what this is about and can't figure it out. And we listen to everything from Disney to Classic, to Broadway. YOu name it. So we are not just Sesame Street CD lovers. But this music is a joke. No talent. ONE tone of voice and as if he forgets to open his teeth while singing. Barbar saves this CD but what a waste of money for ONE song. DON"T BUY IT. And all these people who fall for it.. grrrr. It is like a art gallerie. Everyone stands in front of the picture that shows a green dot. And they come up with tons of explanations what it may be and how fantastic the artist is. And in reality he is sitting back and chuckling because he just ran short of a painting and spilled his paint brush while cleaning it. Give me a break. Shame on Disney and Nickelodeon to fall into this as well. And taking out great singers and shorten real talents opportunity. WOw, guess you can tell I am not into it. ;0(  Explore, again.. everyone has different taste. But I just don't get it, nor like it. I find it horrible.    
 I got about one third of the way through before giving up on this book. Without knowing anything about the author, it seems like a romance novelist trying to write a mystery, and I think readers of both genres will be disappointed in this book.   This is my first Amazon book review, from an avid mystery reader who hopes to write more reviews to help others as I have been helped by these reviews. I am not overly critical of books and if it's an enjoyable read, that's what matters to me. I won't spoil the plot, but will give my honest opinion 
 this dvd sucks. im a die hard strokes fan and expected the dvd to open up with some strokes music or and interview or two.there is absolutely no strokes music and they have a few like stock photos of them doin their thing live but other than that this dvd is a complete letdown.do not waste ur money go buy their two albums instead 
 This dictionary may be good for the layman, but it is far too general for a law student or lawyer.  Only the most common legal words are included, so most of the words are familiar to lawyers.  Those words that are obscure enough to require a dictionary are not included.  I would recommend this dictionary to a layman who wants to understand simple legal terms, but not to a lawyer or law student 
 Mr. Morris did wonderful research on technical trading and clearly knows what the charts are about.  Morris goes on to clearly discuss that the difference between using technical analysis and using it well is understanding the philosophy of the market, the specific pattern and the interpretation of that, not simply by saying yes this is a buy signal because of the specific pattern but rather because of the physicology behind it and feeling that went with it.  He fails to execute what he claims he will do in his introduction.  I would save your money and not waste trying to struggle to unearth whatever little advice Morris gives 
 I work for a book summary company.  One of the books selected for summary is this book.  When you have the world famous author who made the startling expose on the Watergate scandal and Assistant Managing Editor of Washington Post, write about the eventful hours following the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center, your expectations are naturally very high.  But Woodward lets you down, as this book leans heavily on transcripts of National Security Council meetings and extended interviews including over 4 hours of interview with George Bush, to reveal the layers of decision making process that followed the cataclysmic incident.  By providing the details of the close-door meetings amongst the key central players, we do get to size up partially on the personality of those involved.  We are privy to the arguments and ideological differences amongst the principal leaders as President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, forcefully put their weight and power behind their viewpoints and decisions.  We are treated to how the CIA successfully waged an intelligence war against Afghanistan leading to the fall of the Taliban.  Beyond that we get precious little in terms of clear opinion on the dynamics of the decision making or the wisdom behind it.  A mere reportage of the collection of meetings and interviews are best served in a newspaper, and thus could ideally have found its way into Washington Post.  In the publication of a book, we expect a renowned media investigator as Woodward to undertake a more serious study such as on policy matters or the depth of leadership involved or an incisive analysis of personalities and so forth.  This is a rather tame book and hardly adds anything of great value, and much less so to the trailblazing work that Woodward is capable of.  
 I purchased the set hoping to get the some of the best bits / most well known sketches of Monty Python and I have been sorely disappointed.  The interludes in Cleese's disc are ludicrous / unfunny, as are a number of them on other discs.  My suggestion would be for the owners of the material to have a fan vote for what is the best and make a set out of that so maybe we could get the Ministry of Silly Walks and other well known pieces rather than second rate renditions filmed at the Hollywood Bowl 
 This is the first book by Shaara I have read. And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last.    On the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes "literature read like history and history read like literature."  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to "pulsating life."  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.    I must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story.  After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook.   His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.    After the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.  Shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective.   And, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry?  I suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well.  For those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall's work.  And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him 
 Since when have comics become a medium for projecting current topical events (drug use, puberty-induced angst, teen pregnancy)?  Morrison is a gifted writer, but its obvious that the guy is trying to kill the title. Things are complicated enough in the X-Men titles (New X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, Ultimate X-Men, Exiles, etc.), but this takes it to a new level.  Who are these people?  What do they bring to the table in terms of advancing the storyline?  Why is Xavier just sitting around and letting his students kill people? And what's with the art?  I can forgive on the condition that this is the same guy who penciled the original Aeon Flux, but thats about it 
 Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as  the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on  television.  But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its  story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment 
 The author has developed an interesting world: there are parallel realms populated by magic and non-magic beings (ranging from plain humans to dragons), an interesting magic system (with levels, but also specialized castes), a decent-sized cast. Unfortunately the trilogy suffers from lots of problems that are impossible to ignore when stumbling over them many times in hundreds of pages. Note that this review may contain spoilers.  First there's the rampant overuse of 'taboo' subjects like S&M, rape, incest and pedophilia - it's not innovative, daring or edgy, just unrealistically widespread and pointless. Consider that in the first half of the trilogy, two of the three leading men are continuously being 'punished' by excruciating pain from rings attached to their sexual organs, the female protagonist lives in a children's mental hospital visited by 'uncles' who rape and kill the occupants (without the families ever noticing), the evil witch has intercourse with children - including her own son, another main female character was produced when her mother was violated (later killed), there's some father-daughter incest in the family of the female protagonist, and it just goes on and on and on. The second half of the trilogy is a bit more restrained in this regard, but still treats us to some real gems in this department.  The trilogy also suffers from a typical fantasy problem: excessively powerful characters. This problem is however enhanced by the most asymmetric distribution of power between good and evil I've ever seen.  The magic system consists of 13 different power levels, symbolized by colored jewels - the darker the color, the more powerful (black being the most powerful). A black-jeweled individual is powerful enough to destroy a good part of a city and kill/disable hundreds or thousands of weaker individuals in one outburst of power. Somebody is considered to have basically no chance when fighting a person with a darker jewel. Given this, consider the power distribution in the book: on the evil side, there are two red-jeweled witches (level 10) and for the rest the obligatory cannon fodder. On the good side, we have the only two black-jeweled men (Saetan and Daemon, level 13) and the only black-jeweled woman in the world, two level 12 men (also the only ones in the world), one level 11 woman, a dragon with undefined tremendous power (who never uses it) and the main female protagonist - Jaenelle. Jaenelle has, as a child, the power equivalent to dozens of regular black-jeweled persons. When she grows up, she goes to a previously unknown level that is darker than black; according to Daemon her power is the equivalent of *thousands* of black-jeweled men, making her probably more powerful than the rest of the world put together. Just to top it off, at the end of the book she gets yet another special power level created, just for her, though we are not told what that level actually means.  By the second half of the trilogy, we have all this effectively infinite power (plus the cannon fodder that on the good side is actually roughly the strength as the evil witches) gathered in one place, yet somehow unable to eradicate the wimpy evil. Hazard a guess as to what damage all the good power causes in the first 95% of the book... it makes the two evil witches ugly. Yep, that's it. The ridiculousness of this situation is emphasized by the fact that Saetan has a red-jeweled *butler* - in other words, the guy who opens the door and brings the coffee on the good side is as strong as the strongest evil character.  Third are the unrealistic characters: everyone is incredibly handsome, infinitely rich if they need money (we are told Daemon pays a 2 mln gold coin bribe and could do it again if necessary and he even owns a secret private island somewhere - all of that achieved with secret investments while being a pleasure slave?!), extremely powerful (see above), telepathic, has the ability to transport him-/herself over vast distances using 'the webs' or gates and several of the characters have the ability to resist and produce poison as well as interpret the future or heal dangerous injuries. In fact the super-rich Daemon is so drop-dead gorgeous and hot that he can satisfy women sexually - yet leave them longing for more for days afterward - just by looking at them.   The difference between good and evil is that the good ones are very nice, caring, sentimental and wimpy, while the evil ones are stupidly backstabbing evil and love S&M.  For example on the good side we have Saetan, black-jeweled, natural Black Widow, 50000 years old High Lord of Hell and High Priest of the Hourglass (sounds tough and impressive, right?) who we see giving a foot massage to some other guy, and whining about wanting to borrow a romance novel. All guys on the good side are douchebags and almost all women annoying spoilt brats.  On the evil side the two witches continue to come up with all kinds of small, stupid plans to get Jaenelle in their power. A plan fails? No matter, kill the one responsible and go to the next stupid plan lined up. Not unlike Pinky and The Brain - I was waiting for "Gee, what do you want do to tonight?" "Same thing we do every night, try to take over the world.". In the end they *almost* get the obvious idea (war), but that doesn't quite work out because they get distracted by a pathetic kidnapping scheme that's doomed to fail. Frustratingly stupid really. The only thing that's more stupid is that the infinitely powerful Jaenelle spends most of her time in the book being completely exhausted and emaciated due to dealing with side-effects of these plans or her own incompetence - however stupid and transparent the plan, Jaenelle is going to almost-but-not-quite die or lose her powers fighting it.   Fourth problem is that the language chosen by the author makes suspense of disbelief difficult. There's repetition (humans snarling, 'males' versus 'females', fruitless attempts of the super-powerful to get drunk (they usually can't because they're so damn powerful), continuous complaints about how exasperating this or that is), words that simply don't fit in a fantasy setting (powerful wizards/warlords over and over again referred to as "boyos", shopping sprees), unrealistic amenities (running hot and cold water, the presence of a "Dr." who is in charge of the mental hospital - while medicine is in all other cases done by Healers with no academic title), Bond-like gadgets (manufactured by the super-powerful Jaenelle in the second half of the book).  Last but not least, the world is not properly explained. In time, you do get an idea of how it's organized, but as the purpose of the book is not to let you puzzle on this, it should be explained beforehand, or in an appendix or whatever. The scale of the world is also not clear: characters effectively jump between places (because they're so powerful and can travel "the webs" - we have no idea at what speed this is or how long it takes in most cases) and between parallel realms - they don't ever walk or use a horse for more than two miles or so. Jaenelle knows just about everyone in the book and just about everyone knows who she is and adores her on the first meeting (unless they're evil). The result is that the Black Jewels universe feels very small and claustrofobic.  Two stars for the idea, half a star for the writing style. Rounded down because I think it's very overrated at this point 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 The author is all over the place. He skips around so much that the first couple of chapters come across like a bunch of unconnected cliches. I am usually a positive reviewer, but this book reminded me of the kind of garbage college students write when they don't know what they are talking about. Sorry professor 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 In "Iron John," Robert Bly announces that American men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness.  He illustrates his point with one of the Brothers Grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point.  He also draws heavily on Freudian and Jungian theories.  He proves his point in the same way Freud and Jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying "This is what I see, I am the expert, so that makes it true, Occham's Razor be darned."  Bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.  For example, Bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone).  Bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true.  He does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen.  Could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)?  Naw, it's gotta be that "dreams" thing.  Bly also describes a case where students during the Viet Nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the CIA.  Bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work.  Bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger.  No, there had to be a "real" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have Robert Bly to tell us what it is?  Along the way, Bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes.  It's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what?  I could interpret the same passages to mean something else.  If I lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite Bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.  Bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however.  It underscores what is wrong with his whole premise.  He tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea.  Sorry Bob, you can't have it both ways.  One gets the impression that "Iron John" was cynically written to fill a niche.  Like all self-help books, "Iron John" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy.  Bly's target audience is White men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements.  If you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then "Iron John" is not for you 
 There are very few serious articles in this magazine-- just tons of tidbits (stats/facts/tips). By the time you get to the end it's difficult to recall anything from the magazine; it's that shallow.  Occasionally there's a good recipe, but that's about it 
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 98% of this thin book is about how many buttons a certain uniform had on it and what type of boots a certain unit wore.  Almost nothing about the Italian Army of WWII was in it.  A more appropriate title would have been "The Uniforms of the Italian Army 1940-45: Africa" 
 While Lonely Planet Cuba does a good job of discussing the country and its culture in an objective way, its discussion of hotels and entertainment is way off. Prices for hotels listed is correct, but reviews of the property and the surrounding area is terrible. In addition, the discussion of nightlife is ridiculously off - Cuba has very little nightlife!! 
 Here's a fantastic idea: Let's make a documentary about someone about whom there is virtually NO information, just bits and pieces culled from the memories of strangers who came into contact with him once or twice some 30-odd years ago, who accomplished absolutely nothing save for writing and illustrating a voluminous fantasy novel that no one will ever read.  I guess his art is okay, I just don't really think there is ANYTHING about a reclusive old janitor who wrote a book that is remotely interesting, and in my opinion, the filmmakers did nothing to convince me otherwise. 
 It may seem incredible, but this book actually gave me the encouragement needed to experiment with the drug.  Heck, I didn't know you can sniff it.  And, according to the author, it's not very dangerous. Quitting entails little more than the equivalent of a really bad case of the flu.    I tried it.  It's not as she describes. Not at all.  It's been a while since I read it, and I must admit, I remember very little about it.  Which speaks more to its content than to my memory. Very little humanity, heart, all the good stuff we're looking for in books, art, and life.  I actually do feel sorry for the author.  In any event, readers she be aware that her portrayal of heroine use is quite inaccurate and misleading.  I speak from experience 
 I have red this book and I think this book compleatly mislead people about Buddhism and Sri Lankan comunity. For a person who wants to find out more about Sri Lanka and Buddhism (The truth I mean) there are lots of books. I think that the Tamils who started the war and whole word knows it. Buddhists are normally peaceful people and Tamil Tigers and people who support them like this one hate Buddhists.....Please get a life... 
 If I want a 3 Musketeers bar, repeating the affirmation "I enjoy this moment now" is not going to help me.  I won't enjoy the moment until I have a 3 Musketeers bar!  How about telling me an alternate, healthy food I  can eat that nullifies whatever internal chemical reaction causes the  craving?  Don't buy this book if that's the information you're looking for

 The author writes to much about himself in this story. I expected this book to be about Reagan. We do not need to know what type of car Dick Morris was driving; or about his personal relationship with his wife. This book is long and rambling. I find it hard to believe this is the same author that wrote Theodore Rex. Maybe Mr. morris would have been better served to write two books; one an autobiography( which he comes close to in this book, and a book about DUTC 
 I love Alan Jackson, he is one of my favorite vocalist.  But this and his other greatest hit CD is mixed compressed and to loud.  Having it on my music list while listening on my headphones causes me to rip off my headphones when his music comes on and blows out my eardrums.  This has happen once to often.  I now have removed these two albums from my music list to save my ears.    To listen to his music anymore, I have to be careful and set my music low enough to get a better sound level.  So I listen less often now to Alan Jackson 
 I personally couldn't finish this book, but that was only because I found that I couldn't identify at all with the female lawyer. If you enjoy courtroom dramas and are interested in law, this would be the series for you. I enjoy Tracie Peterson's books, but not this one. "Angel of Mercy" is about a female lawyer who is determined to defend only those she believes are innocent, and when a man comes to her that she's not convinced is innocent, she's not quite sure what to do. When she starts probing for information she starts to wonder if maybe he is after all innocent.  That's as far as I got, as I said this book just couldn't capture my attention, maybe it will yours. 
 I was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra - I loved the cotton, one-hand closures, and the lack of underwires.  It felt and looked great when I tried it on, but after a few hours of wearing, it had the classic problem of riding up in the back.  Eventually I gave up wearing it at all.  I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted, so I had the right size (34F).  I'd recommend a Bravada bra for larger sizes, they consistently fit great and stay put.  
 Incredibly dull "hard SF" novel reads more like a soap opera set in the nail-bitingly-intense world of academia. Skip it

 I purchased these thinking that I was buying the AA Big Book; there are distinct similarities upon initial (online) inspection. However, this isn't the entire Big Book; certain passages that I've found to be most relevant are absent. What good is this, then? Most dismaying is that their purchase price is the same as the standard AA Big Book. I've returned this purchase; it's far more practical for me to return them  than it is to try to fit these 'round pegs' in the square holes that are best filled with a bona fide AA Big Book.  Better luck next time. : 
 This is a perfect description of what this product has become and the people who use them.  After purchasing two battery charged water piks, the first was an Inter-Plak, and having them both die within weeks, I looked at the comments and found everyone has the same problem.  What's worse is that the nickel cadmium battery can't be thrown out without environmental harm, they have to be returned to a qualified dealer.  Of course, most people probably don't do this so these companies are not only defrauding their customers, they are spoiling the enviornment with disposable products that can't be safely disposed.    I just bought the model that attaches to the shower.  Don't know how it will work out, but it won't burn out.  It won't foul the environment.  It doesn't use electricity and it won't clutter my counter. Its considerably cheaper.  It seems like the way to go, doesn't it?  
 You can find all the information (and more) this book provides on the internet. So if you have a little time to search the web, you don't need this book.  And it doesn't answer all the questions you may have. You still need the help of a lactation consultant or your baby's doctor. So if you have more problems than mastitis and engorgement, this book won't help you 
 On page 11 of this book, the authors provide a list of what they think are the unifying themes of neoconservatism.  "[One theme of neoconservatism is a] belief deriving from religious conviction that the human condition is defined as a choice between good and evil and that the true measure of political character is to be found in the willingness of the former (themselves) to confront the latter. ... [Neoconservatives] analyze international issues in black and white, absolute moral categories. They are fortified by a conviction that they alone hold the moral high ground and that disagreement is tantamount to defeatism. ... They disdain country-specific, realist, and pragmatic analysis."  In order to evaluate this passage, consider the following fundamental question: Do there exist methods for determining whether one form of political organization is superior to another?  This same question can be posed in the economic sphere: Do there exist methods for determining whether one form of economic organization is superior to another. In fact, such methods are applied in the economic sphere all the time. For example, the IMF may undertake to determine whether a nation's financial system is sound or needs reforming. Implicit in the IMF's actions are the assumptions that 1.) some forms/features/characteristics of economic organization are, in fact, preferable to others and 2.) the IMF has a methodology for distinguishing between desirable and undesirable features of economic systems. This should not be surprising. After all, businesses like Moody's and Standard and Poors make determinations about the financial soundness of nations and multi-national corporations all the time.  Two more points can be made. First, whatever the basis for the determinations made by institutions like the IMF and the ratings agencies, it is safe to say these determinations are not founded on "religious conviction." (I personally am both a neocon and an atheist.) Secondly, once these institutions have made their determinations, they often seek to use some form of coercion, or conditionality, to force nations with undesirable economic characteristics to modify those characteristics. For example, the IMF may make tranches of funding conditional on certain reforms being implemented in a timely fashion.  We may conclude, therefore: 1.) there do exist methodologies for determining whether one form of economic organization is superior to another; 2.) these methodologies are applied on a regular basis; 3.) these methods are not based on "religious convictions," and; 4.) it is not unnatural for multi-national agencies to seek to coerce nations into reforming economic organizations that display undesirable economic characteristics.  And yet, if all of these conclusions are true of economic systems, it is not surprising that they should also be true of political systems: 1.) we should not be surprised to find methodologies for determining whether one form of political organization (or a kind of political organization with certain characteristics) is superior to another; 2.) we should not be surprised if these methodologies are applied on a regular basis; 3.) there is no reason to think that the basis for these methodologies is to be found in "religious convictions," and; 4.) it would not be unnatural for multi-national agencies to seek to coerce nations into reforming undesirable political systems.  One may reply to point 4.): "Yes, such actions are appropriate for multi-national agencies, but not for a single nation operating unilaterally. Also, suasion should be used instead of coercion." To which I would reply: "But, what if the multi-national agencies have failed to do their job? Also, suasion and coercion are two points on a continuity. War is merely the continuation of policy by other means."  So, there are certain points that are agreed on (or should be agreed on) by all and some points on which there are disagreements. The points that should be agreed on are: 1.) certain forms of political organization are, in fact, preferable to others and 2.) these preferable forms can be identified and should be encouraged. The points that are not agreed on are: 1.) Who should do the encouraging of nations to change their political forms? and 2.) How should this encouraging be done? As for the points that are not agreed on, I think the disagreements are arrived at in good faith: there are arguments to be made on both sides. But, certainly the Bush administration can make a very strong case that the United Nations has failed to perform its duties in encouraging political reform throughout the world and that war is a proper instrumentality of coercion to effect regime change under certain extreme circumstances.  Let us return now to the passage quoted from the book. First of all, we can see that the idea that methodologies for distinguishing between good and bad political or economic organizations must derive from "religious convictions" is a canard. Secondly, we can see that it is not in the least unusual for agencies to use such methodologies to try to make determinations as to whether particular organizations are good or bad -- to assign "value judgments," in other words. As for the question about how "the character of a politician" should be defined, we can see that, well, yes, the character of a politician, just like the character of, say, an accountant, is, in fact, measured by a willingness to distinguish between good and bad and to oppose the bad. For example, the character of an auditor is determined every day by his willingness to apply a methodology for distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable accounting practices and to refuse to sign off on unacceptable ones. We have seen over the last several years what happens to financial markets if this "true measure of character" is lacking. It would be absurd to argue that an auditor who is applying his methodology should be criticized because he is "analyzing issues in black and white, absolute moral categories." The real problem starts when the auditor stops analyzing issues in black and white and begins to blur the picture or accepts the CFO's argument that the company ought to be allowed to present financial information in a "company-specific, realist, and pragmatic" way.  In other words, if the main accusation against neocons is that they seek to apply a methodology to distinguish between good and bad political systems and then stubbornly promote good political systems and oppose bad political systems, then, most neocons, I believe, would probably say that they were guilty as charged. For, compromise in the face of evil is worse than defeatism. It is, in fact, (here is that awful word again that post-modernism and relativism have such a difficult time with) immoral 
 What happens when you cross Friday the 13th with "The Running man"?  The Jason strain reveals a reality show that pits death row convicts against one another until there is only one left, as an added bonus Jason is thrown into the mix to make it more interesting.  Now take this and throw in an outbreak angle(this happens when a scientist creates a designer serum and mixes it with Jasons blood creating a virus that oozes from jason and affects all of his victims and all of their victims).  Turning all of em into what jason is.....a powerful undead.  the rest of this book is a survival jaunt in the costa rican islands that has echoes of any zombie movie ever made. Survive and cut their heads off!  I thought this book was o.k., the first half of it was all character history for the dozen or more characters. Jason takes a back seat until the second half and even then he's in the passenger seat where he should have been driving.  Christa Fuast paints some really interesting background pictures for the characters, along with some snappy dialogue, although with a couple of steamy scenes laced throughout. I felt like I was reading some cheap harlequin romance books. The Jason Strain didn't feel like a true friday the 13th story.  Die hard Fans I think will be disappoited.  Bottom Line....Jason wusses out a few times in this book...Not bad and certainly not good 
 I love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  After seeing this set at Sephora I tried it for a week and found the results mediocre.   My hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but I am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  The shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  The mouse is interesting.  It definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  The overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.    As is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  I believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair.  I would recommend you try it.  You can always return it if you're not satisfied 
 I found most of the information in the book confusing to use and not updated information.  Never did find any information on the hotel we ended up staying in.  I did not get a good feel for the city using the information provided. I was hopeing for more information to make my trip a more affordable vacation. Overall, I got more information off the Internet just searching.  
 As a Christian for over 42 years, I find this book both insulting to Christians and in violation of core Christian teachings.  To begin with, Ms. Folger apparently thinks being a Christian is supposed to be easy and should go unchallenged by all others.  The truth is that Christianity is at it's strongest when it IS "under attack" by those who disagree with our beliefs.  That said, this book unfortunately cowers behind self-serving, hyperbolic misdirection instead of standing up with true evidence of Christianity being "criminalized."    The thread of untruth most broadly woven throughout the book is that when laws separate official government business -- courts, schools, the IRS, etc. -- from religion, it is trying to "criminalize" Christianity.  The truth is that separation of church and state PROTECTS Christianity, and other religions, from abuses of power by politicians of another (or no) faith.  This was put in place because America's founding fathers saw monarchs and dictators of their time kill, imprison, and steal property from those who did not follow the "official" religion.  They also saw thousands killed in wars fought over which religion should be the official one of the state - something we still see today.  So if we do away with laws now separating church and state, as Folger suggests, we would actually institute a greater threat to Christianity.  In fact, separation of church and state also strengthens our Christian organizations with many legal ADVANTAGES over secular organizations.  Not only are our churches exempt from taxes, but we don't even have to file financial reports with the IRS about how collected moneys are spent, as any secular organization does -- even other non-profits.  Federal law also helps us challenge local zoning ordinances that, if we were a secular organization, would restrict the ways we use land.  Likewise, our schools, day care centers, and other church-owned businesses are not subject to as many state licensing requirements as others, by a long shot.  If Ms. Folger is going to claim that the government is out to "criminalize" us, as a Christian she should also have the honesty and fairness to also show the many ways that the government supports us.          Ms. Folger also positions anything that doesn't promote her skewed approach to Christianity as a bitter attack on it, which is nonsense.  Her examples of people being "barred" from practicing Christianity - like the people ordered off a bus for "discussing" their faith and potentially offending other riders - are incomplete and told out of context.  In that case, for example, the people kicked off were especially belicose in their "discussion," and didn't just offend other riders, but reportedly made two of them fear they were about to be attacked.  I'm sorry, but I see being rude and potentially threatening as particularly un-Christian.  And when Ms. Folger twists such facts to support her thesis, and she does this repeatedly, she overtly violates the 9th Commandment.  Furthermore, the fact is that there are still more Christians in the world -- and FAR more in the U.S. -- than any other religion.  In addition, the amount of Christian programming on cable TV has almost tripled in the past six years, sales of Christian pop music has grown 300% since 1998, the number of Christian colleges and universities in the U.S. is up 22% since 2000, and The Bible continues to be the #1 selling book in the world.    So, if Christianity is, indeed, under attack, as polemics like Ms. Folger would have us believe for the sake of selling her book, it appears to be the healthiest thing for us Christians.

 I recently just purchased this rack to haul at least 2 snowboards. In the description it states that 2 boards will fit. Well to my dismay, I found that only 1 board will fit. I am a big Thule fan and have bought a roof rack and accessories to haul my bikes plus kayak. To me, this carrier is not up to the traditional Thule quality. I feel that it could have been made better and larger to fit what the description calls for.

 I had a 1GB Titanium Sandisk Cruzer at work fail.  I tried several times to contact Sandisk, including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response.  My wife's Cruzer just failed as well (the power light comes on, it is recognized by XP, and the light goes out, the system can't ID the device, so it's useless.  It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our house).  I've tried front side USB connections, rear connections and hub connections.  No dice.    I'll never buy another Sandisk Cruzer.  And I was going to order another 100 for the office.  Their loss 
 We thought that this book was on the boring side because there should of been more action or excitement. Our favorite part was when her grandmother came over. Our suggestions are to add more excitement and to make the book a little longer 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
  A young man desires a pretty young woman, who makes a fool of him. The 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags painfully. Both versions have some strange scenes. The attractive, but deceitful charm of the pretty young woman leaves the young man empty, and so the audience.   The 1947-version is much better, with John Mills, father of Haley Mills.   Mr. Dickens wrote the story "Great Expectations" in 1861, after leaving his wife. Mr. Dickens married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years; during which he wrote his brilliant novels: "Oliver Twist"-1839, "A Christmas Carol"-1843, and "David Copperfield"-1850. Mr. Dickens left his wife in 1858.   Unlike "Great Expectations", Mr. Dickens's great novels have a high-minded thought; balance with moments of cheer, triumph for the main character, adventure, and interesting characters. A novel is not a classic just because it is: old, assigned in English class, and written by the writer of other novels indeed brilliant. "Great Expectations" has portions which show Mr. Dickens's talent; however overall it lacks the charm and elements that make his other stories enjoyable, true, classics.   Walt Disney, usually brilliant, made the poor decision to go from one feature length animation film at a time, directly, to working on three such films at a time, over-extending and nearly bankrupting the company, as World War II closed Europe to Disney. The Disneys saved the studio, only, by becoming a public corporation, giving up total family control and ownership. Mr. Disney's poor decision followed the tragic death of his beloved mother, caused by a leaking gas heater, that had supposedly been repaired by a Disney studio mechanic the day before. Mr. Disney hurried to use work as a distraction from his grief. (This is also likely the reason Bambi's mother is killed.) Mr. Disney eventually bounced back. Divorce is also traumatic, even if for the better. I do not judge Mr. Dickens's divorce. I do say Mr. Dickens's divorce from the mother of his ten children affected his writing, and for the worse, telling in the empty "Great Expectations".  
 I was really looking forward to movie.  My goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period.  Many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50's Westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing, these alone did not turn me off from watching.  My real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting.  Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, a stage coach is robbed, my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors.  They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers.  Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed.  As the movie plodded forward, scene after scene left me wondering, how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn't rehearse more.  I felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment.  I generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly, I think it was an embarrassment and waste of time.  Maybe it got better (that is why I gave it two stars) but I find that doubtful.  I am wondering if both Tom Berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of Script Writing 101. 
 What Michael Cunningham does best in this book is the little things.  Similes and metaphors and various details are almost always right on.  The story itself, told in alternating first persons, spends most of its time telling us about the characters, especially toward the end.  It seems we have four psychologists who do very little other than analyze themselves and the others.  First, people don't analyze themselves or others nearly to this degree.  Second, the characters actually do very little when not analyzing.  Two other issues are the improbable three-way love affair and Bobby's indefinable sexual orientation.  The worst problem of all is that this is a character-driven novel and I just didn't care about what happed to any of the characters 
 As should be expected from an elite propagandist, Bill Bennett is quick to deride "the elite", of which he is a committed member.  The "we" that is doing the fighting don't include fat and happy neocons like Bennett, but rather people who don't have the sort of mega-wealth that enables Bennett to spend tens of thousands of dollars on gambling binges. Bennett's book no doubt brought him another large payment from lobbyists of the military industrial complex who feel entitled to our tax dollars.  Not only is their war profiteering hidden, but so is the reality of US aggression all over the world.  Contrary to Bennett's convenient omissions, history did not begin on 9/11.  Before that day, the US was knee deep in hundreds of thousands of Arab corpses due to the sanctions on Iraq, and the bombing of its water and sewage systems.  Additionally, the US has been propping up despots in Saudi Arabia, and building bases throughout the region (and the world) to liberate the people from their resources.  As if that isn't evil enough, we continue to use Israel as a gendarme and to support its brutal occupation.  Since anti-Arab racism is so prevalent in this society, the deaths of Arabs is not an issue for many.  But for purely selfish reasons, Americans should be concerned with the self-delusions that Bennett offers his readers.  For no matter how much Bush's handlers suggest that our military empire is simply trying to achieve security, the rest of the world knows better.  The victims of our multi-trillion dollar military establishment know that they need to defend themselves from America's state terror, and they're already building the weapons and making the alliances to do so.  Moreover, a continuation of our quest to dominate will likely bring about another attack on the US, and not only will we experience more death, we will see further steps toward limiting domestic freedoms - exactly the sort of thing that George Washington warned "overgrown military establishments" would do.  A much better understanding of why the power elite is cajoling us to fight can be found in the DVD, "Why We Fight," not the Capra film, but the more recent production that features the words of Eisenhower and other true patriots who would be appalled by war marketers like Bill Bennett.  "War is a racket." -General Smedley Butle 
 I dislike purchasing books that offer more in the title than they deliver.  I would have preferred more specifics in this book than narrative generalities.  B/W photos were poor.  The promised section on booth design left me with more questions than answers. This book offers nice filler information, but if you're looking for nuts and bolts, look elsewhere 
 There is a lot of information here, about one of baseball's greatest  ballplayers, but far too much of it is slanted toward the negative.  Reminiscent of modern attacks on Ty Cobb and others of baseball's halcyon days, this is one of those politically correct, revisionist treatments that juxtaposes modern mores on another time and another place. A good treatment of Tris Speaker would add to an appreciation of the national pastime. This book is not that treatment 
 This one got way too much attention from NPR. I loved the interview there with the author, but, quite frankly, his entire story was told in that very sitting. This "book" is really an "essay" that doesn't deserve all the paper it's printed on; I would've been much more appreciative of this author's sentiments had it been marketed more appropriately 
 I never bother with music like this but I just heard (and really listened to) 'Girls, Girls, Girls' for the first time and I feel the need to say something. Harold Cruse comes to mind, "If Blacks do not completely re-organize culturally, politically and economically, they will not survive regardless of what changes America undergoes. That quote says it all. The reviews below fascinate me. Black people's minds have been constructed to think this is who they really are.  P.S. This is the most sexist, misogynistic song ever made. This cd is an affront to any sensient Black person 
 The book was helpful for me to gain an understanding of the Muslim point of view. However it definetly was biased in its view without any recognition of the wrongs that Islam has inflicted on society for the last 1400 years

 Features are good and usage is easy. The problem is display. Numbers on LCD is only visible at a certain angle, otherwise it is blurry and you cannot see.  Display even get worse when you click on light button to see at night. I always need to take it into my hand to bring it to ceratin angle so that i can see. Very poor quality LCD display, I wish i could return it but I put all packaging into trash. Probably will put it into trash soon, as soon as i find another clock with bright display 
 Newt and William are going to write a new book.  It will be called an Alternate History of World War II.  In it Germany will win the Battle of the Bulge BUT lose the war.  Their next book will be an Alternate History of the Revolutionary War, in it the Colonies will win.  Then they will together write an Alternate History of the First World War.  In this stirring book, the ALLIES WIN, THE ALLIES WIN. What is the point?  Also read Sidewalk Sam below for a fuller explanation of this lousy book 
 Whole Foods recipes are not as healthy as they prescribe, nor that tasty.  We have tried several recipes from this book with hopes that we would find something that would satisfy us.  We never found any 
 This is my second Daniel Silva reading, having read The Marching Season first.  This book spends far too much time and energy on character development and overly-detailed visuals.  There's way too much "atmosphere."  I'm halfway through it, and it is truly trying my patience.  I've checked out A Death in Vienna and Prince of Fire from the library, and have better hopes for them.  Marching Season was more action-packed than this one.. 
 Or even more than 25% of it. I'm not kidding. You may have read in other reviews of the so called `monkey puzzle'. I laughed to myself when I read it and ordered the game anyway. I am a veteran gamer of over 20 years, surely with time and patience, I would be able to get through. I am also a graphic artist, so needless to say, accuracy shouldn't have been my problem. No. Wrong. What actually happens in the puzzle can only be labeled a glitch in the software. I progressed from mild frustration to wild rage over the day and a half I spent trying to solve this thing. Even when I broke my own rules and read the exact solution online, I could not get it done. Why? Because the actual game will not let me. That's right. Some sort of glitch prevents me from activating the right wheels so that no matter how fast or perfectly I operate them, I can't make the puzzle go past the point when the monster is in the pit. I use the exact combo to get the white monkey to come out and throw fruit on him. Nothing. He sure comes out AFTER the monster is free, though. He also comes out any other time, so I know I'm doing it right. He comes out except when I need him to to solve the puzzle. And yes, that is the only solution to it. There is no other way. So after getting all the patches and cheats and everything else, I've finally gone totally dishonest. I have downloaded a save game with absolutely no guilt whatsoever. I will see the rest of this game anyway. Ubisoft should offer a patch to remove that puzzle because it's defective and so hard as to border on absurdity. I just don't understand what happened here. Myst has never had twitch gaming in it. I play Mario or Donkey Kong for that stuff. And you know what? Those games were actually well programmed and WORK. I warn any Myst fan to stay as far away from this as they can unless they have a save file. Now I can see the lush landscapes and try to piece the rest of the story together. I'm just sorry that Ubisoft took away my chance to enjoy this game the right way.  I guess I can see why they have ended the franchise. After the other 4 games, this was such a come down. Myst was always known as a thinker's game, that encouraged taking time and savoring the various locations, the kind of thing that you could be immersed in without action game type puzzles. It's a little hard to enjoy the lush graphics when you are shaking with rage. At least if they wanted to change genres, couldn't they have done it right? Don't say you weren't warned. 
 I was disappointed at the lack of practical suggestions and techniques. This book seems to want to inspire without giving specific practical tools and techniques on how to do it. This is not the book for me. I'll keep  looking 
 I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be "ruggedly handsome"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war 
 THE BEGINING WAS VERY AMUSING BUT AS IT GETS ON I JUST DON'T FEEL THE ROMANCE ANYMORE. THE SEX IS PRETTY MUCH CONSTANT BUT THE HEROINE'S CHARACTER WAS WAY TOO CHILDISH. SHE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK. SHE'S NOT VERY EXCITING OR UNDERSTANDING LIKE THE OTHER FEMALE IN DARA JOY'S OTHER BOOK. THE GIRL JUST LEFT ME COLD AND SORRY FOR THE GUY. WELL, THE GUY IS VERY SWEET AND TRIED TO WOO HER FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END. AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A CHALLENGE TO HIM BUT THEN IT BECOMES A LOVE CHASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CUTE. ALTHOUGH HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER, THE ONGOING OF HIS MASCULINITY IS VERY ANNOYING IN THE HEROINE'S POINT OF VIEW. IT MAKES ME THINK SHE'S LUSTING AFTER HIM. BUT ANYWAY, I FIRST I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT STILL IT LEFT ME UNCERTAIN OF THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER. IF IT WAS ANY OTHER HEROINE, THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE PULL IT OFF EASILY 
 Too specific to charity.  Not generalized enough to perform in a "normal" situation.  Was disappointed with the read.  
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 Babies don't scare me except when I have to change a dirty diaper.  The storyline of "It's Alive" simply did not interest me and I found myself bored, bored and bored.  I don't think this storyline works very well and as a result I think the movie is largely ineffective as a horror movie.  If you want to make this into some kind of a politically motivated flick as a reviewer mentioned above, that is fine, but that's the only way anyone would be able to read any interest into this plot because the actual movie itself for entertainment purposes is sadly inept 
 This book (The Return of anti-Semitism) is merely a catalog of the rise in modern anti-Semitism. It ultimately fails deeply and thoroughly by not even attempting to explain the reasons for anti-Semitism or the solutions to anti-Semitism. Indeed, the author even seems quite proud to brag about not knowing the reasons or solutions. It is as if he is so horror struck at the mere thought of anti-Semitism that he feels his only job is to point it out so that the whole world too can be equally horror struck with guilt. Being horror struck, however, is not a sensible or just policy.     It's true that in America we are still horror struck and guilty about anti-Semitism, largely as a result of our particular moral disgust at the German holocaust. Accordingly we always support the Israeli gov't, although nobody really knows where this policy came from or why we pursue it despite the world wide hatred toward us that it has engendered, and the direct connection to 9/11. We don't dare risk sounding anti-Semitic by suggesting  that if we had supported a just peace (internationally built and defended wall at internationally recognized borders) in the Middle East rather than blindly supported the Israeli occupation, 9/11 would probably not have happened. After all, the terrorist are over here because we're over there.       When Likud came to power in Israel they openly swore Israel would no longer be a "dwarf state" and that they were not occupying the West Bank but rather liberating Judea and Sumeria according to Biblical prophesy. Much of Israel does not support this blatantly imperialist, racist policy; yet America does out of a blind dumb fear of being or feeling anti-Semitic. You can admire us a little for being so sweet,  but how practical  is our sweetness and dumbness when directly and indirectly it caused 9/11 and makes us hated by much of the world? As long as we blindly give Israel the weapons to kill Muslims in the West Bank how can we blame Muslims for thinking of us as Western Crusaders or Zionist occupiers, and much of the rest of the world for hating us as Texas sized bullies?     The author completely ignores the core issues causing much of modern anti-Semitism and the possible solutions, because he prefers to manipulatively capitalize on the Holocaust guilt that has served Likud's deadly occupation of the Muslim West Bank so well. We can no longer blindly pretend, as this author does, that modern anti-semitism can exist separately from American's and Israel's 50 year war against the Muslim West Bank 
 Trendy revisionist garbage as to be expected from the Yale imprimature. This edition is strictly for collegial faculty club bores. Get the edition edited by Stefan Collini instead he's less interested in himself 
 Gun nuts NEED to have their guns taken away.  What the NRA doesn't want you to know is that most firearm murders are committed by legal gun owners against members of their own families or other close friends and associates.  They also don't want you to know how many children die every year by accidents with firearms and suicide by firearm--if those guns weren't lying around the house for them to find, those accidents and those suicides would not happen.  I pray for the day that the US government will get the moral compass necessary to GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PRIVATE CITIZENS.  
 "Doctor Saw Cobain's Suicide Coming" Newsday Ellis Henican; 04-10-1994.  Doctor Saw Cobain's Suicide Coming  Ellis Henican  The telephone rang Friday night at a doctor's office in Rome, Italy.  Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, who was working late, picked up the phone himself. "Of course," the doctor said. He remembered the musician from America, Kurt Cobain. It was barely a month ago that Cobain, his mind in a mile-deep coma and his belly full of drugs and alcohol, was wheeled into Galletta's hospital, which is the American Hospital in Rome.  Cobain was not expected to live through the night. But the doctor, with patience and a powerful stomach pump, managed to stabilize the musician's vital signs. And after a couple of days, the coma completely evaporated.  "Now, everything I have done has been useless," the doctor said.  Before last month's overdose, the Italian doctor, who is 59 years old, had never heard of Kurt Cobain. He had never listened to the music of the band Nirvana, and the whole concept of "grunge" was completely foreign to him.  But he knew a junkie when he met one.  "After he woke up, he told me it was an accident," the doctor said. "He said he had been confused. He had taken pharmaceuticals and alcohol together. He said it was just a mistake."  The doctor had his doubts. Cobain, he could tell, was a veteran needle-drug user. He could see that from the veins. And longtime drug users, the doctor knew, are rarely ignorant about the facts of pharmacology. "I made sure he had a room with no windows," the doctor said.  Cobain had the usual enablers around him. The wife, a former stripper named Courtney Love, was backing up the big-mistake theory of the overdose. So were the various Nirvana hangers-on who had rushed to the hospital in Rome. And when Cobain woke, he had the usual junkie's charm, enough of it at least to quiet the doctor's questions.  "He was very tender with his little girl, who is about 2 years old, I suppose," the doctor said. "He told me he was feeling much better. He said he was happy to be going home. I suggested he take a period of extended rest. I told him, `Nobody ever died from too much rest.' "  The doctor was right about that, too. When Cobain died last week at home in Seattle, it wasn't from too much rest. It was a single blast from a shotgun, which he had pointed directly at his own head.  "It does confirm my suspicions," the doctor said from Rome. "I don't know what you can do in cases like this."  Cobain's death at age 27 may not mean too much to people over 35. But to millions of unhappy young people across America, the songs of Nirvana said something loud and true. The sound fell somewhere between pop and punk. The band spoke to an alienated generation, especially to young people in their 20s, adrift with no jobs, no ambition, no future and little hope.  The album "Nevermind" sold 10 million copies and made Cobain a star. It also turned Seattle into the hottest music town in America and convinced young people everywhere to wear flannel shirts again. "Grunge," the music and the style was called.  Cobain, with his stringy blond hair and waifish physique, was the top grunge poster boy. He played guitar, sang and wrote most of Nirvana's songs. And he was, by all accounts, utterly unequipped to handle the band's phenomenal success.  Since the big album hit, he'd been spending most of his time shooting huge amounts of heroin, lying about his drug use and bemoaning the burdens of superstardom.  "Teenage angst has paid off well," he sang on the band's latest album, which came out last fall. "Now I'm bored and old."  He was, in fact, a new kind of pop idol, full of aches and pains and hopelessness. This is who young people look to, when their lives are not full enough.  Cobain said he had a terrible stomach disorder. But it never seemed to show up on any medical test.  He said he used heroin to "self-medicate" the stomach pain. He said, but nobody believed that explained his ferocious drug use.  In February of 1992, he married Courtney Love. She was loud and blond and pushy, everything Cobain was not. She had her own band, called Hole. After she married Cobain, Hole was signed to a million-dollar contract. The two of them were the John and Yoko of the 1990s. Or the Sid and Nancy, depending on how old you are.  Later that year, they had a baby, Frances Bean Cobain. Courtney said she was using herion during the pregnancy. Then, she denied she had said any such thing. After the baby was born, Cobain said he had given up his drug use once and for all.  That, of course, was a lie.  When Cobain got out of Dr. Galletta's hospital in Rome, he again announced that drugs were a thing of the past. Again, not quite true. He was binging so hard, his friends finally dragged him to a Los Angeles drug-rehab clinic. But he quickly checked himself out. He said he didn't need the help.   Yeah, right.  Despite all the lying, Cobain always had a special credibility with the fans. Partly, this was because of the angst-filled lyrics. Partly, it was his powerful singing voice. And partly, it was because his own early biography so mirrored so many of theirs.  He came out of Aberdeen, Wash., a ragged logging town where the timber mill jobs were disappearing. His parents divorced when he was 8. He was bounced among relatives who would grow quickly tired of him. Even in his middle-20s, Cobain still had the look of a kid who got beat up a lot in high school, a kid who had found his success in rock-and-roll and his solace in too many drugs.  "What a terrible message to leave for the people who loved him, the young people who loved his music," Dr. Galletta said, after hearing the news of Cobain's final hopeless step. "I hate to think he was moving in that direction all along."  Ellis Henican, Doctor Saw Cobain's Suicide Coming. , Newsday, 04-10-1994, pp A07.  
 This writer was never a salesperson.  He is not much of a writer either.  I don't believe half of the experiences and feel he loves to try and make himself important 
 I had read that Dave Eggers is friends with Sarah Vowell and David Sedaris and had hoped that like company meant like creativity.  Unfortunately I found Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius to be extremely lacking in the creative department.  I will not give up on Eggers just yet, however I'm just confused as to how A Heartbreaking was a Pulitzer finalist.  The story lacked continuity and Eggers' attempts to wrap himself in the tragic balcony accident suffered by his friend were tacky at best, pathetic at worst.  A Heartbreaking is worth reading, but I caution the reader that it is a definitely underwhelming experience.  
 I have long been a Dowd column reader, along with a half dozen other opinion page writers, and picked up this book at our local library.  There are many reasons why one writes a book, you have a story to tell, your editor / publisher gives you an idea, you want to keep your name before the public, you need the money, just to list a few.  I can't think that Dowd needs the money, unless she is being bribed because someone found out she is actually a conservative!  I also don't believe that she has the visceral need to keep her name before her public.  If she had a story to tell, one would think that it would be told in a more convincing, thoughtful manner.  Since I am male and a grandparent, I'm guessing that I am not the target audience for this book, and the positive reviews from several potential career women would seem to corraborate that they are the intended audience.  And herein lies one of my problems with Ms Dowd and this book.  It appears to have been written by a mid to late 30's woman surprised to find out that her options are running out, not by the 50 plus year old that she is!  Those of you with 50 year old mothers or aunts, I ask you, do they talk like this?  Is this the kind of advice you would expect from them?  Or has Ms Dowd, at least emotionally, stopped growing at about the same age as the ladies from 'Sex in the City'?  I expected a significantly more mature viewpoint from her.  I also quibble with several other points she attempts to make:  That Hillary killed feminism.  Well she didn't.  Feminism is alive and well, just ask my sisters, wife and daughter.  Some feminists lost their credibility attempting to defend Bubba's actions with Monica L (moral relativism), but what killed that part of feminism which was based on the supposed male belief that women were not their equals, was its internal inconsistencies---the same thing that doomed the USSR!  Please try to tell my wife that men are her equal when she had been leading her family--three brothers just like Ms Dowd--since she was 12!    Yes, drugs and plastic surgery are a problem--for folks with too much disposable income and too little to keep them out of trouble!  New York, LA and DC,while fine cities all, are not the entire US, and what passes for currently acceptable behavour, among the elite in those three cities, just isn't on the average person's radar.    As earlier reviewers have said, other writers have made the same arguments, much better, so I am left not having a reason why this book was written.  I am left with an hypothesis only, that Ms Dowd is questioning decisions she made over the last three decades, trade offs, questionable choices, etc. and is wrestling with those, not having yet come to a conclusion.  My data points are her lack of a response to Monica L; her acceptance of the job after her potential boss hits on her, giving a bye to Anita Hill for somewhat similar behavour, ditto Hillary.  I wonder what those nun she had in school would say?  As commented in the book vis a vis Elizabeth Vargas' removal from the Evening News, perhaps she doesn't have the 'gravitas' to write a book?  Or as Helen Gurley Brown said of Ms Dowd's initial effort for Cosmo 'pure pablum' 
 There is some fair content, however I was not inspired or blown away so-to-speak with the presentation and usefulness of the book.   It felt high-level, flat and academic at best.  Shouldn't a book on creativity be creative?  
 This movie was pretty terrible.  I never did see Tony Jaa, and he was the reason I bought it.  I noticed later that the picture on the back of the DVD case was taken straight from The DVD case of "Ong Bak".  The camera quality was terrible, as was the editing and overall acting.  There were times when the camera shot would turn a shade of blue, then red, then regular.  I can say, however, that my friends and I shared a good laugh over how terrible this movie is 
 Terrible.  A waste of money.  This comedian just yells everything.  Very similar to Sam Kinnison.  If you liked Sam, you'll like Lewis.  I prefer humor that requires a better sense of humor to think up.  Just screaming 100% of the time isn't my idea of a funny act 
 Wow, I hope Precious M was joking when she/he said that the lead singer would brag about how he's a "musical genious". Musical idiot is more like it.  This is a bad cd from a terrible band. All the songs sound alike and run together so much to the point where you're in the middle of a track and think to yourself, "wait didn't I just hear that song"?! The melodies are also very dull and boring.  The singer's voice is downright hideous! A very nasal tone. Plus, he's out of tune.  The lyrics aren't horrible but they aren't good either.  The best thing about this album is the artwork because it looks like a diary. This album is horrible, though. I regret buying it completel 
 This book would leave no untrained reader to think Saddam was a good guy or beneficial in anyway for Iraq. The book discusses the former Iraqi president (actually dictator) who killed massive amounts of Iraqi kurds, got hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed in an eight year war with Iran that Saddam mostly started and mentions Saddam's takeover of Kuwait. But Saddam is a creep whose bad activities can't be overestimated nor can they can they all be listed and this book doesn't mention how Saddam killed half million Iranians in that war or how much of Iraq went up in flames during that war or how Saddam bombed Tel Aviv with SCUD missiles as part of an attempt to start a whole war with Israel. Missing also is Saddam's second attempt at taking over Kuwait in 1994 plus his misbehavior that caused operation Desert Fox in 1998 plus the fact that Forbes magazine rated Saddam wealthiest man (on earth!) #5 in 1997 at five billion dollars personal fortune and money means power. All this means Saddam was a growing threat when he was taken out in 2003 and it was not just for Iraq but for the sake of much of the rest of the world. The book also fails to mention how Khadafi of Libya quit his own nuclear bomb building project when he saw Saddam get captured in 2003 by fearing that he (Khadafi) might the next to get captured should he not start behaving himself. An added huge benefit to Saddam falling. 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Just that, apart from C U when U get there, the rest is just the worst coolio possibl 
 I was disappointed with "Missing Men." I was expecting to find bits of insight, perhaps a pearl of wisdom here and there, something to connect with and relate to, being an artist, having been a single mother, having loved intensely, surely these were things that connections are made of....and yet I am left with the sensation of this being a fairly dry and remote recital of Johnson's family & relationship history.  I felt she was more of an impersonal narrator rather than intimately and emotionally involved with her story.  I finished the book wondering why Johnson had written it, what was her point, what did she want to convey to me with her memoirs?  What did I gain by reading it?  Nothing, I'm afraid.  I compare this with "Too Close to the Falls" by Catherine Gildiner... both set in New York, both describing their childhoods (well, I guess that's a prerequiste of a memoir, isn't it)... Johnson's book left me dutifully turning the pages to finish it, to get it over with... just the opposite of Gildiner's book, I hated to see it end.  Why did one bore me and another interest me?  I have no answer for that, perhaps it's entirely due to my psyche and has nothing to do with the authors.  But this is not something I'm adding to my recommended reading list 
 Wow - all these raves! There isn't room on the net for all the stars something really well-written and original would get. This book is just plain mediocre  -  I could barely make it through to the halfway point. On the upside: great titl 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 Hi,  I have a similar setup to Noah's (I use Media Center 2005 though) and similar issues with my dlink DGE-530T. While transferring files between 2 computers with a gigabit connection- the transfer does not complete as the network cuts off the connection beforehand.  The network will also cut off and/or freeze quite often when I use the "windows remote connection" to access the computer equiped with the dlink card.  That computer also has 10/100 based onboard lan (which I disable when using the gigabit card) which functions perfectly under all situations- eliminating all potential issues with the router and switch.  I do not believe the card is defective per se (i.e. another dge-530t will probably have the same problem)- but it may be a PCI port compatibility problem. My motherboard is the ASUS A7N8X Deluxe, which is a fairly recent MB with full updated bios and of course windows xp updates.  Would appreciate any assistance on this matter.  Best, Case 
 The program title should be "Italian visual art and its influence on surrounding nations."  Clark does make many one sentence statements on topics other than art but they are shallow and frequently wrong.  If you are interested in the history of western civilization, read How Shall We Then Live by Francis A. Schaeffer.  This book is aimed at college students and is at a much higher intellectual level than this video.  Even though there are some religious comments, the first 80% of the book is totally secular in its analysis of the history of culture. The religious comments are ethical types that Plato and other ancient philosophers would make.  The video was intended as entertainment for the general public in Britain forty years ago when it was common for adults to have less than 12 years of schooling.  This is why it is so shallow.  About the same time there was a more intellectually oriented program "Ascent of Man" on BBC but this will probably not be released because of the severe dumbing down of the television audience in the last 40 years.  One demonstrable falsehood is the statement that a handful of  monks in western Ireland saved the literature of the infinite past.  This is totally false.  For one there were not enough monks to copy the thousands of volumes involved. The literature of ancient Greece and Rome was preserved in the middle east.  The copies of the Bible available today go back to within 100 years from the original writings.    The narration is shallow.  Here is an example.  Palestrina is considered the earliest great composer of classical music. His music is played in the background while visuals of architecture of his time are shown.  The narration says nothing about Palestrina and the comments about the architecture are along the line of, "Look at the pretty buildings."  In contrast to this, the Taggart police detective program, which makes no pretense to being cultured, had one episode that contained a few minutes of Palestrina's music and a few sentence description of it.   There are many strange things about this program.  One example is the title of one of the hour episodes is "The Artist as a Hero" yet there is not one sentence describing a heroic act done by an artist.  The closes thing is the narrator saying that he can imagine the statues of hansom young men could represent men who had done heroic acts.  Yet he does not describe one of the heroic acts.   Another example is the narrator slowly caressing the prow of a boat and saying that it has carvings on it.  We are not given a close, detailed look at the carvings or given any information about what they represent or why they were carved onto the boat 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 I am not excited about this purchase because it is just "another hints book" like all the other authors.  I wish someone could come up with a better book pertaining to this subject! 
 I bought this expecting it to be made of canvas, as in tent canvas.  This is more like the texture of a bed sheet.  It collapses if you barely touch it 
 First, I am prejudiced against graphic novels though I thoroughly enjoy the books written by Gaiman, which don't need anyone's grim, dark artwork to substitute for Gaiman's excellent use of word-pictures.  I'm afraid that this book dredge's up what Gaimna should have left tucked in a sealed box.  The stories I was able to read were incomprehensible and/or with no ending. This book was an attempt to re-cook some years old hash 
 I was hoping this book would provide easy to ready clear answers to questions regarding Catholicism and the meaning of the mass.  To me it was like reading a sermon with too much explanation into the history of each part of the mass.  I was looking more for a quick reference and explanation of why certain things are done are certain times during the mass,,,kind of like a Catholic 101 or Catholic for Dummies book.   
 If you are just trying to learn polymer chemistry, this book is too complex for you. It may be good as a reference text, but I doubt it. The exercises don't coincide well with the material and the main concepts get lost in too many specifics. Skip this book if at all possibl 
 Most people (mis)understand Norse ("Viking") religion as wooden idols and human sacrifice where the "gods"* are an Ikea version of the Roman/Greek pantheon; Odin = Jupiter, Thor = Poseidon etc.  But an important part of belief concerned fortune-telling.  In the saga Arrow-Odd, and we find this: 	 [Odd is the foster-son of Ingjald, a wealthy land-holder.]  Odd cared little for sacrifices to the gods, but trusted to his own strength [...] There was a witch-woman called Heid who had second-sight so with her uncanny knowledge she knew all about things before they happened. [Heid and her followers are invited to a feast by Ingjald, against Odd's wishes.] After the meal was over, people went to sleep, but the prophetess and her company went to carry out their night-rituals. [The following morning Heid calls up all in the household.] She told each of them what the future held for them, and they were all pleased with their prospects.  Then she predicted the weather for the following winter and more that was not previously known. [Then, against his protests, Heid predicts Odd's life and death.]  "Damn you for making this prophecy about me," said Odd.  And as soon as she'd finished speaking, he sprang up and struck her so hard on the nose with a stick that the blood gushed onto the floor. [Odd states that he does not believe any of this and leaves Ingjald's farm.  The prophecy, however, comes true in all details.]  The story of Odd indicates many issues covered by the book: prophecy as a slightly suspect practice, but one that the pragmatic Norse included in their beliefs and the fact that its practitioners were mostly female and that warriors tended to be hostile towards it.  Very little is known about the practice, so those who are seeking their Pagan roots have to "re-create" the religion - they have to make it up.  Oh dear!  The example given is the theme of the book: oracular seiðr - foretelling the future.  The writer is a modern Pagan and seiðr practitioner but has little to say from personal experience.  The best accounts are given by others, in fact just a handful of experienced and articulate seið-workers.  The book would have been better if it was a series of in-depth interviews with these people.  There are frequent references to seiðr as originating with the shamanism of the Sami people (known to most of us as the Lapps) and there is a whole chapter devoted to the shape-shifter Gunnhildr, the famous witch-queen of Noway, then later of York, who learned her skill from the Sami.  A lot of ink is spent debating whether or not seiðr is shamanism, but since anthropologists cannot agree on what shamanism is (and don't like it much anyway), this seems wasted effort, as does the extensive argument developed from Queer Theory, but perhaps that's what you have to do these days in US universities.  There are only a few quoted examples from the sagas and one particular example is worked to death.  One big unanswered question is "how good is it at telling the future?"   But the interviewees use weasel words like "healing" and "insight" when describing their experience.  So modern seiðr seems no more than another meditative technique.  If you put your head under a blanket and cut off the supply of oxygen to the brain, you'll have visions, especially if you are chemically assisted as some practitioners are.  Written for an academic audience, this book has all of the good and bad points that we associate with that.  It's well researched, but the text tends to be very dense and a bit of a hard slog.  Its conclusions are cautious and supported by the evidence, but not exciting.  This does have a place on my bookshelf, but you might be better off reading the sagas instead. 
 I suppose this is a good book for someone who is just learning how to play poker.  I didn't have much faith in the book when I purchased it.  It's cheaper than alot of poker books, so I figured Hellmuth would at least share a couple of good nuggets of information.  If you have never played poker and want to learn the rules of the game, and starting hand strengths, you will benefit from this book.  If you're a thinking player looking for insights from others, look somewhere else 
 Aidoo gives new meaning to the term "female whiner". Her brief "novel"(about 132 pages) is a trying exercise in whining about being a woman, and being an African. She may have cause to whine, but please spare us the long poems that break up the text. If I wanted to read poetry, I'd buy a poetry book. I hate it when authors insert poems in midstream. It breaks up the text, and detracts from the action. Anyway, Sissie is a Ghanaian who visits Germany, makes cute with a German woman, and reflects on how bad colonization and Africans can be. Not recommended except for insommiacs 
 Add me to the folks who thought this would continue the storyline and were disappointed. There's really no reason to get this one unless you just want to own them all. All of the footage is cut from older episodes with a few extra bits of dialogue added.   Wish I'd checked for reviews before picking it up. 
     This is not a bad book. It is a standard, fairly decent introduction to mythology that's a heck of a lot better than Edith Hamilton. The reason why I give it one star is the price. It is not worth more than 45 dollars. Very few books are, and the ones that are, have hard covers. This is a disgraceful ripoff and there is absolutely no excuse for it. Morford, Leonardson, and especially the PUBLISHER should be ashamed. Yes, the book is well-done, with pretty pictures, but it's SOFTCOVER. It's worth perhaps twenty dollars, maybe thirty at most. It is a very typical example of the utter sliminess of the textbook shell game. Years ago, it once had a reasonable price. Then, when the publisher realized that it was being assigned as a textbook, they raised the price to a ridiculous level, and produced - and continue to produce - more editions so that any old edition you get will be slightly off pagewise. A minor rearranging of contents occurs to justify dupes buying the new edition thus to make the old editions worthless. Take a stand. Do not buy this book. Professors, do not assign it. If your professor assigns it, request that you may use an old version which you will be able to find for five dollars online. The changes in the book are NOT essential enough to justify this gross piracy.      By the way -- I'm a graduate student studying Greek and Roman history, religion, and literature at Berkeley. I believe I am fairly qualified, then, to make this argument. The price of this book is a disgusting shame and should not be tolerated. 
 This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks 
 OK, I love early Ludlum. That about says it. Icarus starts off too slow, never picks up and should not be signed by Ludlum at all. Wonder if that's when his books started to be ghost-written. Giving it 2 stars in case it was written by Ludlum 
 I think Collaborative Web Development was ahead of its time when it was written in 1999, but today it reads more like a relic.  It also doesn't help that the writing style is rudimentary (Ms. Burdman should've considered using a ghost writer) and the book is littered with typos.  Maybe the book could be useful to people who have absolutely no experience in working with companies that have a web site, but there's got to be better stuff out there.  I would NOT recommend Collaborative Web Development for anyone who has any bit of experience in project managing for the web. 
 I had the La Crosse WS-2310 "Professional" Weather Station for 2 years, and it was NEVER fully functional.  I had to return the unit 3 times, as well as do a store replacement once, and I used the system for a year without the wind speed unit working - I simply didn't want the cost of returning the system yet again.  The software is absolutely horrible, and during the 2 years I had the system, there was never any software upgrades at all.  Given how deficient the software was, this was quite surprising.  For example, there is no calculation of daily rain amounts or monthly rain amounts.  The system is too stupid to differentiate between days.  The date recorded to the simple spreadsheet database is always one day off (yesterday's date is recorded today).  Overall, the software looks to be a high schooler's science project done the night before it was due. If you're going to purchase a La Crosse system, plan on spending money on 3rd party software, as well as allowing about 30% of your purchase price in product return costs. La Crosse tech support is non-existant: call & get a recorded message to leave your number & they will return the call - but they NEVER do... and I do mean NEVER!  Send an email and the same response - NONE!  It's a very frustrating joke.  After 2 years, I gave up and purchased a truly professional system from a competitor.  My only regret was having waited 2 years to throw in the towel with La Crosse.  I give La Crosse 1 star only because there is no 0 star rating 
 I was so excited to find this book after reading Richard Preston's other novel, The Hot Zone. I found this book to be written extremely inconsistently. While reading this book it seems as though Preston is changing from writing to a mature, educated audience to writing for an audience of five year-olds. He takes the time out to describe each new character in a bland way. His descriptions of these people consist solely of their hair and eye colors, stature, and way of speaking. WE DON'T CARE! I wish he had spent more time on the actual story instead of digressing. He also added random sections including one accusing Iraq of harboring weapons grade smallpox without proof. I was thoroughly disappointed in this novel! The only reason why I finished it was because I was too far into it to stop when I realized how much I truly hated it! If you liked The Hot Zone, don't read this, it's awful 
 I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book.  Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal.  If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters.  My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret.  Your husband will get a lot more out of it!! 
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!  
 Please forgive me, I do not prefer to be overly critical, but this book started out with so many innacuracies and sexist undertones that I just could not trust the author. Even those with the best intentions often lead people astray in their zeal and ambition for what they perceive to be "spiritual" or "selfless" longings. The author demonstrates in the introduction a profound disrespect, even for those who teach her, that goes beyond being a productive iconoclast. She also is, at least indirectly, sexist. If we replace the gender in even most of her other book titles, for example, rendering them: "A Man's I Ching" "The Man's Spirituality Book" "All Men are Healers: A Comprehensive Guide to Natural Healing" I think we could observe a pattern developing, as if a guide to natural healing could be comprehensive by focusing on only one gender. Still, if a man tried to get away with that, he would be considered a bigot, and rightly so, but I wonder why not a woman. Still, it doesn't end here. Her innacuracies in regard to history are further disuading. She calls Buddha "the great savior of India," which is quite a statement, something I am not familiar with, although I have been studying and/or practicing both Buddhism and Hinduism in both school and on my own for over ten years. She says that many Christian parables were directly taken from Buddhism, something she offers no evidence for. She also says that Shiva, one of the three fundamental gods of Hinduism, whose very symbol is the phallus, began as a woman- again presented as fact but without any supporting evidence. All in all, as I read, these things and others developed a mistrust of what else she may be attempting to teach.  As per the blogs on the back of her book, I do not believe that there is a difference between male/female sprituality. Spirit is not defined by such things, and it seems to me to represent a profound mistrust and misundrstanding of life's balance. Feminism is as empty as "Masculinism." Again, "feminist metaphysics" is another term that seems loaded with ignorance. Perhaps her Reiki portions are good, but analagously I would not take the chance to learn Algebra from a person who can't get their basic arithmitic down, especially when it seems like she alienates herself from the very people who taught her Reiki. Sadly, I heartily do NOT recomend this book or this author 
 silly and insipid, and as grand as the resurrected animation department at disney was from "little mermaid" thru "aladdin" and "lion King" and "beauty & the beast", crud like this only reminded one of the era od "the black cauldron". 
 Part of the value of books on photoshop, particularly ones about digital photography, is in showing you how to take reasonable shots and make them better. In these examples the photos start bad and sometimes get worse. The problem is visible even on the cover. The photoshopped flag looks awful.  Definitely not the book for digital photographers looking to get the most out of photoshop. I recommend O'Reilly's Digital Photography: Expert Techniques instead 
 I read this book during my first trimester, and it made me doubt the integrity of the medical world -- which is NOT a good thing for a first-time mom-to-be in her first trimester. The book made me believe that the worst possible outcome would be  a c-section.   Fast-forward to 10 days *after* my due date: my body started shutting down but I still resisted induction because of this book. Finally my midwife determined it an "emergency" induction and I reluctantly went with it. Because of this book, I resisted every intervention -- and as a result, I had an excruciating 44-hour labor that STILL resulted in c-section. And it was me, not my midwife, that ended up requesting it. I felt I had failed.   In retrospect, I wish I had never read this book. Instead, I should have just trusted my midwife. Bottom line: Don't read this book, but *do* trust your instincts and find a health care provider that you trust. Finding a midwife/doctor that you trust is much more important than any of the negative information in this book 
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 Boring, boring, and oh, did I mention boring?  It was short, not terribly clever at all, and the illustrations are not even Dr. Suess. I felt ripped off.  I don't know why I thought it was tooth "fairy" related, as our daughter just lost her first tooth and we thought this would tie in.  It doesn't.  Neither of my kids (3 and 6)liked this even a little.  They both said it was...boring.  
 I bought this book thinking that it would tell me about breathing and running. Sort of what you would expect from the title.  In fact Dr Justin O'Brien has precious little to say about the subject, and I am at a loss to understand what "many athletes -- from Boston marathoners and national swimmers to international tennis players and Olympic badminton stars" have got out of it. None of these are named, nor provide testimonials, apart from one ultra-runner on the back cover blurb. Dr O'Brien's PhD is in the philosophy of consciousness.  The entire approach can basically be summed up with the words  "train don't strain". Breathe easily, steadily and rhythmically using diaphragmatic breathing. Practise until you can breathe out for twice as long as you inhale, while running. Let your breath  guide your degree of effort. That's it. I can only think that this has been written for absolute beginners. It is out of date (written in 1985) and, for the experienced runner, packed with totally superfluous chapters such as "Why Run?", and "Internal Dynmaics" (ie what changes occur in the body as a result of running. There are also worthy, but out of date, chapters on injuries, flexibility and diet.  Not worth the money. The topic is better covered elsewhere, notably in John Douillard's "Body, Mind and Sport".  
 During the very first use the head popped off the handle!  Doesn't look like there was very much adhesive applied when it was put together so I'm going to try re-gluing.  But having that happen right away was a real disappointment so I can't recommend this item. 
 If you are looking for practical principles that you can apply to teaching or creating educational software don't bother looking in this book unless you think principles like the following, #30 in the book, has practical value: "Learning is set up in such a way that learners come to think consciously and reflectively about some of their cultural models regarding the world, without denigration of their identities, abilities, or social affiliations, and juxtapose them to new models that may conflict with or otherwise relate to them in various ways." The other 35 principles aren't any better 
 Stephen King does some great works.  I loved Hearts In Atlantis, and was rivetted with The Shining.  But the pressure from the publisher to put out paper pulp has finally caught up with Mr. King.  This had to be one of the most boring novels I've read in years.  The only reason I finished was because my wife bought the book for me as a gift.  I HAD to read the book.  The extraterrestial Buick serves as a conduit to another world.  It's an intriguing start to what could be a great plot.  But somewhere in the middle of the book, this car starts spitting out alien organisms from another world.  And while the first creature was kind of original, I found the 9th and 10th creature to be strikingly like the first.  And not wanting to miss the punchline, I kept wading through these gruesome descriptions that were just page after page of the same old thing.  OKAY ALREADY, I got the picture!  Let's get on with the story!!! It might have worked as a short story.  But then, who would pay $30 bucks for a 36 page short story?  I think King will wish that he hadn't released this one, because it will be many readers last purchase from the King genre. If you insist that you are a Stephen King fan, just be sure to buy the paperback version to limit your investment.  Don't check it out from the library, because it will take you so long for finish the darn thing, the late fines will kill you. 
 I purchased this item mainly to view the videos in my laptop on TV but couldnt do so coz my laptop is not detecing the cable at all. Eventhough the product claims that it works with both 4 and 7 pin s-video but doesnt do so. Please be careful that you read the complete specification of your laptop before buying this product. I am going for a 7 pin s-video cable coz my laptop has a 7 pin output but this has only 4 pins 
 At less than a dollar per sparkly Frisbee, this is the best price I can find for Frisbees. They don't fly very well and they break relatively easily, but this is the best value I can find for 100 Frisbees in one place.  A lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable CD media. The problem with that is, they don't work very well for that either. I, too, tested this for myself.  Using Nero Burning ROM, I tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs -=AT 4X=-, just like you're supposed to. IT WORKED! It burned fine. Then it took 5 minutes to open a simple HTML document on the burned disc. Subsequent trials run with the "Verify Written Data" checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning. It's like writing with a white crayon, except this is white paper. This persisted on several OTHER computers with different CD burner drives and even different software.  I finally realized what great Frisbees these things are. Cheer up people: THEY ARE GREAT FUN! So grab your spindle, go outside, and start chucking these things at your neighbor's annoying dog.  PS. I need to sue Memorex for selling this junk. These disc are just a form of abuse 
 "The spy who loved me" is the oddest of Ian Fleming's Bond novels. It is basically the slightly risqué (for the time) story of the sexual awakening of a girl, Vivienne Michel (the story is told through her eyes and Fleming even credits her with co-authorship of the book). James Bond? He turns up about half-way through the book to rescue her from a couple of baddies at a motel in which she is working and share his, er, experience of life with her.  So, what has this to do with this film? They have in common the title and a character called James Bond; there all resemblance ends. In this regard, it's a bit like the Fleming Bond short story "Octopussy", which shares the same fate.   The film has thus to stand on its own merits, of which there are precisely none. This is the most appalling hokum, silly story, woodenly acted by Roger Moore (who did once have the honesty to say that his acting talents went all the way from A very nearly to B) and others. Now I know that the Bond films are not really meant to be nerve-tingling thrillers, because you know that our hero and his panoply of ever more absurd gadgets is indestructible and equal to anything, but are more droll comedies with miscellaneous stunts and explosions thrown in, but I didn't find this one funny at all. (Makes solemn resolution never again to watch any more Bonds in which Roger Moore appears). 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
     Let me start by saying I think that in general, Binney and his music are fresh air. The melodies in much of his music are beautiful,arrangements very cool and his music seems more textured or layered than a lot of modern jazz.     he also seems to understand how to use drama in his compositions better than most.    Now,to this album; unfortunately, i have to say I was let down by this music,especially in light of how much I enjoy his music typically.    There are a few "free" tunes with what sounds to me to be combined performances to give a semblence of structure. The first tune fits this mold and is more interesting than the other tunes in the same vein but still not enough to bring me back to it.     the tunes which are more composed are not as good in any way as his previous recordings. in fact, the best tunes are not even composed by Binney and they feel to me like pale imitations of his earlier work.   All in all, the record seems as if less care went into the music and as if Binney has been bit a little too much by the brooding,droning "New York" thing. Pick up "Welcome to Life".-I promise you won't regret it 
 The CD was great and extra scenes on the Cd were really good, however it could have been advertised that it was the wide screen CD and I would have bought another! So I wasted $21.00 as I have a HD TV but not wide screen. 
 When McCartney was with the Beatles, he was more or less held in check as a songwriter by John Lennon, who really was the guiding force behind the Beatles sound. Without that balance, McCartney went off on his own and basically, became less and less discerning. Or, maybe he just felt that his fans weren't that sophisticated. I suppose we'll never know.   Anyway, McCartney's first solo albums were Beatle-type stuff, and really, not bad. Then came, "Band on the Run" which marked a turning point, and typifies the rest of McCartney's work. I can't imagine how anyone can listen to this sort of garbage without recalling the great sound of the Beatles and songs like, "I Call Your Name", "You Can't Do That", "Drive My Car", or "I Feel Fine".   When artist and musician Robert Crumb was once asked why he killed off one of his comic book characters, "Fritz the Cat", Crumb replied that the character had become "too cute" and "needed killing."   After hearing "Silly Love Songs", "Jet", "Band on the Run", "Listen to What the Man Said", and "Let 'Em In" being piped in through the public address systems of every grocery store and retail chain I've been in for the last decade, I pretty much feel the same way about Paul McCartney's music:  It's too cute, and it needs to go away. 
 If you you purchasing this book because you have no idea about Home Electronics Installation and want to take the test, this book will help you pass. Unfortunatly, if you are actually trying to learn to do this, then you are going to have to move on to something else. This book contains several errors, and does not go deep enough that would make someone feel confortable attempting to install this stuff after reading it. 
 I bought three DVDs(The Wood was one of them)and the DVDs were in European codes which means they won't play in the United States unless you own a "special" DVD player.  I'm very unhappy with my purchase.  My recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country.  This is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices 
 This book is too technical and has too much math. A better book for the elementary learner is "Practical Statistics: Simply Explained," by Russell Langley.  Bulmer's book may be useful to me later on after I understand basic statistics. But don't waste your money if you know little about statistics and you don't like complex mathematical explanations 
 The Riftwar was a good saga.  Pug was good.  Tomas was good.  Arutha was good.  Everything was good.  Then Feist came out with this series...  Anyone who wants to know the plotline for this one just save yourself the money and read the Atlantis attacks comic books by Marvel, the Eternals by Jack Kirby, and the Fantastic #337-340 and then you'll easily see where Feist stole this storyline from.    A dreaming Mad God that influences a world around him, that's buried under a mountain, whose thoughts become reality?/A dreaming Black Celestial from a race of space gods who is buried under a mountain and can control reality around him and is trying to destroy the universe?  C'mon, I can't believe I'm the only who has seen this.  Everyone takes ideals from someone, hence Tolkien syndrome, but to couple it with this sorry book(ie a stupid book where a stupid Pug that throws fireballs but can't dodge them and can't time travel like in other books and can't deal with a minor demon captain)insults the people that made the Dreaming Celestial(KING KIRBY) and the Eternals.  If he was gonna steal ideas, he should have made the entire book worthwhile.  In this book, besides the old guard, Erik is the only guy we really care about.  Characters that were developed in the two lackluster books before are killed off before they have a chance to sign and we're left with characters like Miranda, whom we don't reall any thing for at all.  All in all, a very poor effort in the Serpentwar saga.  Feist gets an A for stealing storylines and an F for originality.  I'll stick to newer guys like Simon R Green, Aaron Mccarty, and Ferrenzano for new takes on fantasy/sci fi. 
 Whatever happened to Hey Dude or Salute Your Shorts?  THOSE, for sure, should be on DVD.  Not the shows that are still on air 
 If your idea of a good alternative film is one devoid of plot, good acting and any semblance of structure then you might enjoy this piece of utter rubbish.  I think this is a sad homily to gay men who get excited seeing ugly German gay men with shaved pubes getting off with one another and then call it art 
 this is a waste of money. It is alot of interviews from a bunch of nobodys that know of britney. No performances and not really any britney.This sucks 
 I completely agree with the reviewer who deemed this novel "overkill" with regards to the puppy mill preaching.  Those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this book and read it are already well aware of the puppy mill industry.  This choir member did not appreciate being preached at for 45 pages of a novel that would have been better spent with more plot development.  Also, I got a little weary of all the explanations of dog training and AKC show terms and slang.  Again, those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this novel already know what UDX, CDX and OFA stand for.  Readers interested enough in dogs to pick up this book but do not know what BOB stands for, what "finishing" a dog means, or what an Open class is would probably take the time to find out.  I would have preferred a Patrick O'Brian appraoch in regards to the terms and slang.  Just throw 'em out there for those of us who know, and pique the interest of those that don't.  The way it turned out, however, is that one hundred and fifty pages of a 256 page novel were all either dog show terms explained, or extolling the evils of the puppy mill industry.  I am a bit amazed that Ms. Conant does not say anything at all about the average "backyard breeder" who knows nothing of breeding dogs and wants to do it simply because his dog has papers, who do just as much damage to a breed as puppy mills, if not more.  Go figure.  I have two other Susan Conant Dog Lover's Mysteries to read, and after this first, I am a little leery of even opening the covers 
 As I was perusing the reviews to decide whether or not I wanted to purchase this book, one thing has struck me as strange. Has anyone noticed that all the five star reviews are from "a reader" and are written in basically the same style? All of them are very well-written, complete with proper grammar---the kind of correct grammar that only a professional writer uses. It's making me skeptical about the good reviews this book has recieved. 
 This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as "this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.  Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough "zingers" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.    Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.  I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a "deadly" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  "Milliseconds" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.    Is this "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
 Although the book is in decent condition, it is completely black and white, not to mention is is the paperback edition, and not the hardcover as advertised 
 For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie 
 We bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets.   My husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping. I thought I would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast.  Typical toilet at Einstein's bagels.   I had a hard time getting it to stay, lifted my son up and placed him on the seat.  He let out a horrible scream and I lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor.   He was bleeding. THE PRIMO FOLDING POTTY SEAT CUT HIM ON HIS BEHIND!!!!!! This product does not fit on toilets, the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him, it hurt him. We will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!   
  I am a solitary practioner for 8 years and have been studying wicca for 11 and when I picked up this book hoping to see that it wasn't as cheesy as the one I had read in the past...but I was disapointed.  There are many, many books that focus on different spells to try or the meaning, histories, and detailed views of wicca with lots of factual background information, this book isn't one of them. It is a lot of pop propaganda made to make wicca and witchcraft look like something out of a movie.   This supposedly "advanced" book doesnt go into details on how to focus or make your spells stronger, it doesn't go into the operations and importance to keep your spells safe so they work corecctly, and it doesn't go into making your own spells (which tend to work BETTER.) It DOES however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell out loud from the book and it will all work in a puff of purple smoke...which is far from reality.   It is full of false information and is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning the religion Wicca or witchcraft in general as there are many basic magical fundamentals that she totally throws aside in this book.  Instead of just reading spells from a book a reader may want to explore other options such as expanding their knowledge of witchcraft and/or wicca, the history behind the religion, who created Wicca. As well as advanced books that will help each idividual connect with nature, the God and Goddess, and themselves.  This book doesn't make readers think or explore but tells them what to do and what to believe while belittling the readers intelligance. This book as well is an insult to many other religions. She tries to make different points of other religions which she obviously has not sudied well. This book not only has misinformation about Wicca but she has does this to other religions as well. Unfortunatly what she mentions of the other religions is so vague and while she points out similarities she doesn't go into them deep enough to point out any differences unless they are differences to make another religion look bad.  This book has left out all practical information which is important, she just doesn't focus on the reality of wicca or witchcraft. It doesn't focus on self growth but on quick fix improvment through her eay to read out loud spells. 'read them out of the book and you won't weep, all will be well'.  This book may seem fun but it it is far from what most consider resonable information. Her differece of opinions and different practices one can handle surely as a form of paganism but unfortunatly she pretty much discards the wiccan rede and portrays a real, serious, religion as a fun and games, do whatever you want choice. Wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed. It is not: 'do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan'. Yes some things in religion are personal choices but the building blocks of the religion are totally lost on her, and it is very apparent in this book.   Freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right, but if your choice is to make up your own religion and spread false information about many religions you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways, Unfortunatly that is EXACTLY what ravenwolf does and encourages everyone to do..perhaps I should start worshiping my pillow and call myself a Unitarian.  This book seems a nice, commercial, and cutesy to make everything pretty and oh so shiny. Alot of information she presents as fact just are not anything more then her opinion and unexperienced readers will have a hard time differentiating. However if you truely want to learn about wicca, its history, and how to cast better spells then you need not buy this book but look deeper into magic and learn what makes a spell work and how to improve your spells, and your life from the inside out. something this book just does not cover. 
 When I purchased the book early 2003 I agreed with most of the reviews.  However, having it read again. It really shows that a lot of stuff has been outdated and certainly requires updating.  Especially on the new trends like Six Sigma, compliance and innovative technology solutions. 
 Alright....sounds like every other emo-rock band that's out there today, EXCEPT they have a female vocalist that makes Karoke Night seem appealing.  She sings like a 4th grader in the school chorus....Sing louder than all your friends so your mom can hear you is MUCH cooler than actually singing well.  Buy this album if you need a good ear-bleeding.  It is a shame because the rest of the band has a decent sound, then they let her sing the courus and your brain melts out of your ears all over your new shirt.  So what it comes down to is that you just bought a CD that you are not physically capable of ever listening to again, and you gotta buy a new shirt.  Do the math 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring 
 Be aware that this book is no longer in copyright and anybody can print and sell this book. I bought this book at Amazon and the print is small with poor font clarity. My zeal for the Lord could not overcome the headaches from trying to read this book. The small "a" is usually filled with ink for example. Buy Clarence Larkin books published by the Clarence Larkin Estate which still keeps all of Rev. Larkins' books in print. They still produce the books from plates instead of a copy machine that needs cleaning. May the people of Sun Publishing join the lake of fire yaht club as galley-slaves for Apollyon 
 Actually it is very sad to mention this blunder against humanity:  When the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in October and November 1914, Britain's communications with India  and the East via the Suez canal was immediately placed in jeopardy. There was a secret agreement with Germany signed in August 1914 by the Young Turks that was troubling the Russians and taken as warning of the forthcoming trouble to The Tsar. The Russians regarded their Caucasian terrirories were also placed in jeopardy. Consequently, the British and French, in order to protect their future `colonies' and bisect the `sick man of Europe', had to act forcefully. They opened another front in the South with the Gallipoli (1915) and Mesopotamian campaigns.   Anxious to score his first military encounter with `the enemy', Winston Churchill, in his capacity as Lord of Navy, prematurely urged a combined French and British naval incursion into Gallipoli. But the Turks were successful in repelling the British, French, and Australia and New Zealand Army Corps. and pushed their eventual withdrawal and evacuation.  ((By contrast, in Mesopotamia - Iraq- after the disastrous Siege of Kut (1915-16), British Empire forces - mainly of Indian troops - reorganized and captured Baghdad (March 1917). Further to the west in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, initial British failures were overcome when Jerusalem was captured in December 1917, and the Egyptian Expeditionary Force under Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, broke the Ottoman forces at the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918))  Russia, the protector of the Greek Orthothox Armenian population, sent her best troops in the Caucasus. The Turkish, Vice-Generalissimo Enver Pasha, supreme commander of the ex Ottoman Empire armed forces, was a very ambitious man. His aim and everpresent dream was to conquer central Asia. Enver Pasha, like Winston Churchill, was not a practical soldier. He launched an offensive with 100,000 soldiers against the Russians in the Caucasus in December of 1914.  His main enemy was the severe Weather conditions.  Insisting on a frontal attack against Russian positions in the mountains , Enver lost over 80% of his troops at the Battle of Sarikamis, in the heart of the tough winter season.  In 1917, Russian Grand Duke Nicholas assumed senior control over the Caucasus front. Nicholas tried to have a railway built from Russia (Georgia) to the conquered territories with a view to bringing up more supplies for a new offensive. But, in March of 1917 (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar was overthrown in the February Revolution and the Russian army began to slowly fall apart. Hence, the protector of the Armenians was gone.  Winston Churchill blunder in Gallipoli, opened patched over wounds and re-ignited animosities between the Turks and their Armenian neighbors. In 1915, the Armenians were the victims of his cowardice. The Turks committed a HOLOCAUST against the Armenians that immediately started after WC debacle in Gallipolis.  The mass murder of the Armenians was indeed the first Holocaust of the twentieth century.  
 when i published this edition of "releasing" back in 1997, it was a must-have for indie bands releasing their own music. because so much has changed in the past five years, this book is now totally out-of-date and out-of-print. please do not buy a used copy of this book! the book is mostly contact info for various independent music-related companies, and all of this info is outdated. the web does a much better job at providing this sort of information, so start searching. good luck! -gary hustwi 
 This has to be Dolph's suckiest movie.  I'm a huge fan, and I own a ton of his movies and watch a bunch more on a regular basis.  But do not buy this movie, save your money and buy one of Dolph's better movies like Army of one or Men of War.  Personally though I'm pumped for the release of masters of the Univers 
 What in tarnation is this?  And who listens to this?  Are you like rolling down the street with your windows down.  Yo check it.  Sufjan...kicking it out.  Heck no.  I would be embarrased to have anyone see me and hear these sounds.  It's like...I don't even know...like a bad production of Jesus Christ Super Star.  ? I can't even beleive it.  I feel like an idiot listneing to this garbage.  Who rocks it like this.?  Where do they find these people. And there are like mad people dying in Africa and stuff...what would they think of you if they saw you listening to this...They would know that they are really going to die.  Oh no.  Look at those crazy Americans.  We are dead for sure now.  No way they are gonna help us, when they can't even help themselves. People. Please.  
 After I heard this cd I bought Gershwin plays Gershwin on the naxos label which arn't piano rolls. Any pianist can tell that many of these rolls are heavily edited and can't be played by a pianists with two hands. On the naxos album that has some of these same songs Gershwin's actual playing doesn't sound very good. Many of Gershwins contempories such as James P. Johnson, Eubie Blake, Luckey Roberts and even Zez Confrey were much better pianists than he was, however they didn't have his melodic gifts as a composer. I would recommend Artis Whodhouse's transcriptions of Jelly Roll Morton's piano rolls (on the same label) instead because most of those are exactly how he played them and in my opinion Morton was a better musician in every way than Gershwin. 
 Although this edition contains some excellent background materials, the translation is less than professional and sins by omission.  Some important parts of the texts are inexplicably left out, such as Rousseau's dedication of the "Discourse on the Origin of Inequality" to Geneva, in which he clearly and passionately explains some of his basic theories of government, through a utopian fantasy about his hometown.  Not only does the dedication give an important political context to the "Discourse," it also adds a touching and pathetic autobiographical dimension to the text.  As such, it is an essential part of the "Discourse."  Also omitted are many of Rousseau's own notes on the text, which are both amusing and illuminating.  Finally, the translation itself leaves out certain phrases, seriously distorting the meaning of key passages.  The above comments only apply to the "Discourse on the Origins of Inequality," but if they are any indication of the general carelessness of the translator and/or the editors, readers would be better off with another edition, for example Donald Cress's translation of the "Basic Political Writings," published by Hackett .. 
 The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story. 
 === quote   Pay no attention to the negative criticisms by those who are obviously Moonies. This is should be required reading. Nansook Hong had the courage to endure and to finally escape the clutches of this dangerous cult led by the Korean flake who thinks he's God.  === end   Funny, so people should not listen to the story of those who are still within the UM, why is this?   Also Rev. Moon himself doesn't claim to be God, this is always said by others, Rev.Moon stresses the point without God he would be nothing... 
 I read this book after coming across it on a "most important books ever" list. I found it very hard to get through. Approximately half-way through the book I found myself counting down the pages until I finished it. This is not a book to read if you're looking to be entertained, however if you're looking for a good bit of culture/history I would think this would be a decent pick. Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing. As a college junior with little knowledge of or interest in African culture I did not enjoy reading this book, however I may try again in the future to see if I can get more out of what others have deemed a very important and worthy novel 
 By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics 
 This CD was devoid of any of Govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. Frankly, it was just a bunch of New Age background noise that one would hear on elevators. Some of the Craig Chaquico-style stuff was interesting, but better left to Craig. Try 7th Heaven, Mosaico or Guitar Odyssey instead 
 This is not a review of Ms. Yates's writing.  Instead, I am awarding the single star to the physical book perpetrated by the University of Chicago Press in 1991.  The good news is that this edition doesn't cost very much.  The bad news is that the 1991 edition is a bad reproduction of an earlier edition.  The ink bleeds all over some of the pages.  There are diagonal streaks on many pages.  Sometimes the ink is light grey on one side of a diagonal streak, while it is dark and smudged on the other side.  Parts of letters that landed in the streak are missing.  A note on the back of the title page claims only that "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the ... Standard ... for Library Materials."  Does this less than ringing endorsement mean that the paper is acidic and will soon deteriorate?  If so, it won't be much of a loss 
 I expected information about design, but this is just a self serving "I am good at what I do" book. I am sure he is good but there is little or no information about how to actually desigh furniture. No proportions, no instruction except make your mistakes on paper by sketching first. A waste of good money. 
 For a book that purports to be about an authentic sharing of life-impacting faith, it misses the mark badly, relegating itself to nothing more than a basic 'how-to' for the proper branding and marketing of the contemporary xtian faith.  If authenticity were the goal, there wouldn't be a basic primer in apostle's creed theology ('know your product'), nor the tips to 'listen more' and recognize conversation hooks in order to capitalize on opportunities ('know your audience' and 'sales-tips').  In essence, this book is a distillation of the pitfall of modern evangelicalism:  remove all beauty and mystery from your faith; distill it to some axioms (three or four work best - and use alliteration if possible); and then slap it on a stranger during some small-talk about movies or television programming.  An especially telling episode involved his spirit-led conversation w/ the female grad-student.  With no big payoff at the end, the author struggled.  What had been the point?  Why had he felt led to reach out to her in kind conversation when it ended before he could lay out the 'Romans road'?  This struggle reveals that there is still something very much missing from the heart of his message: that people are of tremendous worth and that they merely aren't accessories to his own journey.  *Luckily*, at the end of the book, he figured out the point of that episode: she had shown him how to "douse a conversation" with important precepts that illustrate a worldview.  I actually think that learned lesson reveals more about his prejudice and sensitivities then her attempt at indoctrination, but that's another tangent altogether.  I have a hard time figuring out to whom this book would be helpful.  Anybody with a mystical, relational faith in Christ would probably find the stories and discussion questions incomplete and patronizing.  Anybody involved in a culture war would find some of his methodologies to be too much of a soft-sell.  My best guess is that those immersed in the xtian bubble of youth group and bible colleges might be able to read it as a guide for ways to be less offensive to the rest of humanity, but then I remember the conversation mentioned above, and so I have to amend it to 'less blatantly offensive'.  I do give high marks for the graphic design, it is a great layout that greatly aids in dressing up some relatively shoddy material 
 I RECEIVED THIS BOOK, READ IT IN 30 SECONDS, THEN DECIDED TO RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY!  THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN, IF YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.  I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE ACTUALLY PUBLISHED THIS.  PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME!  DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WORN YOU! 
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 Mr. Blum has arguably written the worst account of a war in history.  Amazingly, he chooses to focus on the young Israeli couple torn apart by the war (of course, the whole nation's citizenery were torn apart as well), while completely ignoring the major players in the world (US, Soviets, etc.)  It is as if he was just trying to fill up the pages of the book while doing no research at the expense of the reader.  The great Six Day War by Michael Orin also delves into the incredibly important diplomatic efforts surrounding that war.  No war book can overlook the importance of "world opinion" at the time, but this one does. Admittedly, the Israeli couple had a very interesting story to tell, but it adds nothing to the history of the conflict and the story finishes with a very incomplete conclusion on the two characters.  In contrast, many other great tomes (my favorite thus far is The Two O'Clock War by Walter Boyne) highlight the dire situation that Israel faced, and the necessary US airlift that arguably saved the country.  Also, Mr. Boyne discusses the many lessons learned by the Arab nations (mostly Egypt) and its effect on the Yom Kippur War.   Mr. Blum seems to have an axe to grind on the very controversial general and now Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  It is well known that he was a "rebel" in both the best and worst meaning of the word, but Blum seems to obsess over the negative aspects and the government's repeated attempts to relieve him of his command.  Again, Mr. Boyne addresses this topic more fairly, pointing out that Sharon's soldiers loved, admired, and trusted him, and that his daring was often beneficial militarily.  Truly, a double edged sword. Blum makes no mention of Hosni Mubarak's importance in the conflict.  Of course, the US "ally" (and recipient of billions in aid while his state controlled media incites hatred of Jews/Christians/etc.) and strongman, has ruled Egypt under "emergency" rule for over 20 years (since open to democracy by Condi & George...don't deny leftists!).  His later importance to Egypt is formed partially during the conflict. I could go on, but suffice it to say that any other book you read on this amazing moment in world history would be better written and more informative than the Eve of Destruction. 
 This was a very disappointing story. I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time 
 Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album.  Stevens blatantly rips off his own music.  I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece.  Do yourself a favor and start there 
 I thought I might learn something about this sect of Islam, but I could see from the first several pages this was not to be.  PhD or not, it is written in a round about the subject as is normally the middle eastern way of presenting thoughts.  Such if we talk all around this subject we will be able to snow enough people to make them see our point.  Do not buy this book, even for a used price.  It has nothing to say or promote that is of interest to a western thinker.  Jimm 
 There is no doubt that the alluring vocals and accompanying music are exemplary on this compilation CD. I am a diehard Micheal Franks fan bit I am far different than his light-jazz, lovers' music fan base. Michael Franks is a very profound and intelligent artist who personally cares deeply about the state of the world. To me his best songs are about loss, dejection, optimism, death and when he addresses world issues. However, his love songs seem to exclusively appeal to upper-class lovers and married couples. Only Paul McCartney can overcome such sappiness because he is the master of melodic music. I pray that that the extremely talented Michael Franks will make a real serious album that addresses the world of strife and danger that we live in. For example, a Green agenda. Franks is a vegetarian, wildlife guardian, environmentalist and animal welfare proponent! Our world of global warming, war, species extinctions and universal suffering is a veil of tears not a haven for love songs! 
 while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective.  skip this one! 
 Ok, well maybe I'm a cookbook snob, but I couldn't fathom some of these "recipes". Baked Brie?  I mean come on... who needs a recipe to put a wheel of Brie into the oven??  Or putting sausage in the oven with mustard slathered all over it, or rolling up some chicken and mustard in a lettuce leaf.  These are more IDEAS but RECIPES???  I will admit to loving Bon Appetit and Jacques and Julia, so you'll need to relate there to get me.  Plus, most of their recipes call for "teriyaki sauce"???  It's like my grandma making hundreds of recipe that call for Mrs. Dash.  What do they mean "teriyaki sauce"?  If they really mean that , it has sugar or corn syrup in it.  If not, is this meaning soy sauce?  If so, why is it in EVERYTHING???  I love low carb food, but this cookbook did not help me come to that love 
 The feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness, I couldn't  fully submerge myself into the book because it didn't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material. It read like conjecture for a lot of it, with "could", "would have" , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor, at the same time, it was too conversational, and in all just poorly written. The material was interesting enough, and her conjectures intriguing, it was just the presentation that was faulty. It would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures, as it is...she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel, and it would have carried better. 
 A very adolescent work. Definitely not worth reading, despite the fact that Kosinsky had won an award for this book 
 I had hoped there would be some good ideas in this book. But dutifully reading along produced nothing more than page after page of "this is going to be good, and we're going to start, and it's really going to be good, and we're really going to start, and it's really really going to be good and we're really really going to start..." with pointless "examples" along the way.  Then I realized that if I'm really going to do something with my life, I don't need a book to tell me how. And certainly not this complete waste of time 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 The reviews by BookwormJDC and P.Murray are on target.  They give some excellent examples from the book.  Let me help answer the question that I always want to get out of these reviews: "Should I read this book?"  If you are going to a dinner party hosted by Al Franken or Michael Moore, or need to win favor, respect or envy from anyone on the far left, get this book.  Everything that is wrong with America, Capitalism and Free Trade is explained in charts, cartoons and talking points.  You will look like a genius as you expound on the ills of the world over a glass of California wine.  It reads like a college term paper (Doesn't rise anywhere near the level of thesis.).  There are a plethora of facts, all of which support the theme.  It's easy to read and the authors do a good job of staying on point.  If you have a term paper due, get this book.  Don't plagiarize it, just look at the technique and style.    Here's where I think the term papers get separated from the theses.  In a well-written term paper you can get away with presenting a problem and gloss over the solution.  I like the term reviewer BookWormJDC used to describe the treatment of solutions offered to address the litany of injustices described in the book, "ill-considered".   Simply put, their solutions would not stand up to the same level of scrutiny expended on the problems.  Most of the issues raised are nothing new, but they are well documented and presented. What I found more excruciatingly tedious with each successive chapter was the lack of anything positive in the book.  Ok, I get it. There is greed, oppression and injustice in the world, now what? Anytime they felt compelled to site anything positive, it was snuffed out by starting the sentence with "Although" and finishing up with what's wrong with it!    If you want to participate in the global economy, either for the evil corporations, or the oppressed peoples of the world, there is really nothing to help you in this book 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 ... until two thirds of the way through it limps on withouit a credible resolution and turns in to a cross between Star Trek, Dead Ringers and The Invisible Man. With a better 3rd act this could have been great. The guy can write 
 I can't even begin to give a description of the story b/c there were too many characters, twists & turns and I'm sure I'd only confuse you if I tried.  This book started out strong, but then became ridiculous.  Nearly every male character in the novel was a pervert and had some kind of sexual behavior problem.  I'm not being sarcastic, it's true.    The only compelling part of the story was the romance.  The situation seemed realistic and the feelings were genuine.  With that said, I still wouldn't recommend this book.  Brown's books either completely suck or completely rock.  If you're looking for a good suspense by Brown, read WHITE HOT.  That book was fantastic 
 I wish I could have paged through this book before I got it.  Based on the title, I was hoping that the book would discuss economic developments, new markets, new theories, or new technologies that would lead met to make better investments.  Instead, I'd call this book more of a "technical analysis" piece.  It's basic premise is that stocks move in 20 year cycles, and the cycle for large cap growth stocks ended in 2000.  Therefore, put your money in small cap stocks and large cap value.  It's possible that some readers who invest in mutual funds will find this book useful, although they would have been better served had it been published in 2000.  However, the book does not discuss, let alone even reference, techniques of analyzing individual stocks.    So what if many stocks got creamed in 2000? You didn't need to be a market historian to see that coming when p/e ratios and other indicia of valuation were so out of whack.  Anyone following the value methodologies of Ben Graham ("Intelligent Investor") or Chris Browne ("Little Book of Value Investing") avoided getting slammed.    The book's basic premise is that by market timing specific sectors, individual investors can achieve outsized returns.  I am skeptical that most investors will find this to be the case.   Even the title to this book is arguably misleading.  The book is not truly contrarian - it's about interpreting historic market trends to predict the future.  Anyone who has read a mutual fund prospectus can tell you that the SEC requires a statement to the effect that "past performance does not indicate future results" - readers would be well advised to keep that warning in mind.    If you want to read good books on contrarian investing, get David Dreman's "Contrarian Investing Strategies: the Next Generation," or one of the numerous books on behavioral finance that are available (example: Belsky & Gilovich's "Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes" or Paulos' "A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market.").  Sadly, I wish I had taken a pass on this book 
 It didn't have anything to do with fake ID' 
 Really, Tom.  Leave your religion out of it.  Religion doesn't mix well with sophisticated philosophy 
 There is not enough teaching on Hell.  How can you talk about knowing God with out full-blown explanation on the nature of eternal damnation and hell.  It's impossible.  J. I. Packer fails in a great way 
 VE2 has a ton of potential, but it just doesn't work out.  Brandy Davis is both cute and sexy, of course, but Playboy's Testing the Limits is a much better showcase for her, um, talents.  Not to be mean, but most of the film's other women just aren't that attractive, and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack.  Contrary to a previous reviewer, the massage scene is fairly ordinary.  The girl-girl stripper scene is the most disappointing, however.  It starts really well, with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper, but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action.  The only scene worth watching at all is blue-collar vignette, with two girls and one guy hooking up. Stay away from this one 
 I started reading 'The no.1 Ladies Detective Agency' but could never really get into it. I liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go. Sadly, although the book has some funny moments (Bertie's tantrums!)it never really gripped me. I love Scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider' comments. The book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to..?' and 'what was the point of?'.  On the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with Edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did 
 Horror movies are a dime a dozen now, and nothing really speical about them anymore. Sad to say, considering its probably my faviorte genere. This movie was a disappointment from the start. Whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired. I mean they are standing there talking, and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen. I didnt watch the whole movie, it sucked that bad. I bought this movie used, and I'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge. 
 This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")  This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name 
 I only jumped in to look at what was written about Hemingway and Col. Buck Lanham and it didn't take long to realize how off this author is. The story he writes took place at "Schloss Hemingstein" in the Schnee Eifel region of Germany in September 1944, not in the Huertgen Forest as claimed, which didn't occur until November. Moreover, Hemingway met Col. Lanham back in Normandy in July. Ouch! And to think this made past Wiley editors. Oh for shame. 
 This book is disgustingly slanted toward the position of the pro-Isreali's. Each page is becomes more blatent. It's impossible for any book to be completely void of bias, but Randall Price doesn't even make an effort to lay out the facts and let the reader draw their own conclusion. It's just riduculous. I usually buy my books instead of borrowing from the library in order to support the authors; but take my advice and save you money with this one.  That is, of course, unless your mind is already made up and you simply want to feel better about your obstinance. 
 Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.    John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story 
 Unfortunately, I have to agree with one of the previous review. The book lacks consistency and logic. Just to mention one of the numerous flops - how you can talk about economic order quantity and not mention a material planner. The book is supposed to help an instructor. Well, it does the opposite 
 how about season 1..im tired of their greed!! do it right or dont do it at all!! i dont own any of the volumes 1-5 and i never will.im a huge scooby fan and would love to see these released by COMPLETE SEASONS instead of the stupid (out of order) volumes they come out with.PEOPLE IF YOU WANT COMPLETE SEASONS THEM PLEASE DONT BUY THIS.the only reason they do this is to take your money.lets force them to do it right by not buying these stupid volume 
 Having read the first 3 Women's Murder Club books, this fourth in the series didn't even come close to the previously set standard.  The two unrelated story lines felt gimmicky, but would've been tolerable if each of the plots had been better designed. The court scenes needed to be better researched.  Look, I'm NOT a lawyer, but even I know that civil court is different.  And I also know enough about procedures to know you don't do any "I Object!"s during opening statements.  And by the way, can you even sue a cop for doing her job?  Don't you have to sue the city, and/or the Police Department?  And on, and on.  I don't know if James Patterson or Maxine Paetro wrote that part of the book, but his/her/their ignorance was pretty glaring. As to the serial murders, that wasn't bad, but it felt like this story line was simply tacked on and hurriedly resolved - not very satisfying. And finally, this wasn't a Women's Murder Club mystery.  It was a Lindsay Boxer mystery.  The other club members had cameo roles and zero participation in the crime solving 
 ...this book is really bad. I am a Mark Twain fan, as well. But I cannot let that fact cloud my honest opinion about how inferior this book truly is. It just reads as nonsense, yawn-inducing plotlessness & not so much fairy tale as piddle-paddle. I truly believe Mr. Twain dropped the ball on this one 
 After the second reference to the Clint-on s-e-x scandal, I put the book down. I have better things to do than be subjected to a real life wife beater defending the philandering behavior of a wife cheater. Hey that rhymes. Now I can be a rapper 
 I bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when I rode on vacation When I assembled the trailer, the chain was twisted.  I bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it.    Then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel.  The sprocket was badly bent.  I bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel.  By the time I got it all working, my vacation was over.    By the time I see my granddaughter again, she'll have her own bike.  I'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to 
 Having received a minor in Mathematics in college, I was confident that I could take something of value from this book but I'm afraid that was not the case.  I can't imagine what kind of feeling a person who wasn't as familiar with Math would be left with.  The hypothesis set forth in the book amounts to nothing.  The author doesn't satisfy the needs of the reader.  He leaves them out to dry without finalizing any aspect of his "report."  Neither does he supply the reader with any reasons as to why solving this problem would be useful.  He simply says that there are many reasons, without naming them.  I, personally, cannot think of any good use for the theorem that predicts the frequency of prime numbers.  There may be a good reason though and that's what I wanted from the author.  The last complaint I have is with the superfluous and pointless charts, graphs, tables and diagrams.  They do nothing but confuse the reader more.  The book is well researched.  It paints a nice picture of the history of Mathematics(traced all the way back to the Ancient Greeks) and it clearly defines the progression of the study of prime numbers.  It also provides biographical information on some of the most brilliant mathematicians ever including Gauss and Euler but I don't think that's what the author intended to be the best part of the book.  If you want a historical and biographical account of the study of Mathematics, I'm sure there are better books out there.  This one fails to deliver on the importance and the future of the Riemann Hypothesis 
 She doesn't have the gift of understanding lyrics, she never should have ever stepped in front of a mic, we've got the bozo evil-genious Mitch miller to thank for discovering her...  Not even good as a cmpy singer, this is just plain bad singing, that's not even good enough to be considere "so bad it's good".  It's bad.. 
 As Mr. Lincoln once said, " People who like this sort of thing, will find this the sort of thing they like".  My wife, a fan and American Studies major, loved it. I on the other hand found myself wishing that Patrick O'Brian were still alive.  The first chapter is the best section of the book, but was basically meaningless since I do not believe that baseball embodies Mystical American Goodness.  You will like this book if you are a Delillo fan, or believe that the literary critics know something that you don't.  If not, life is short, find something else 
 I know that the critical reception to "Rumor Has It" was very chilly, but something about the idea of the film really appealed to me.  The concept, the plot conceit, is a genuinely clever notion. Being a fan of "The Graduate," I was interested to see how well they would integrate the "characters" of that film with the "real life" counterpoints in this film.  I mean, come on, Shirley MacLaine representing Mrs. Robinson and Kevin Costner as Ben Braddock--seems like a great idea!  But, alas, when all is said and done--an amusing and well conceived setup did not equal a satisfying movie experience, for me.     Jennifer Aniston returns to her Pasadena homestead with her new fiance, played by Mark Ruffalo.  Plagued with doubts about her engagement, and seemingly disengaged from any real affection for her own family, she hears a rumor that leads her to suspect that the book and film of "The Graduate" were based on her deceased mother's experiences.  Confirming that her grandmother (MacLaine) was indeed the "Mrs. Robinson" character, she deduces that her mother had a fling prior to marrying her father.  Thus, with the notion that she might be the daughter of this man--she sets off to find the truth.  Encountering Costner, as the potential daddy and "Ben Braddock" character, she discovers truths about herself and her family.   All of this plays out very routinely, but the supporting actors are engaging and comfortable.  It's always great to see MacLaine, but she offers nothing new or inventive in this performance--it's the standard brassy MacLaine persona we've come to expect.  Costner continues to embrace his middle-aged status and has, thus, developed into a far more interesting actor than he used to be.  (But for a more nuanced and astute role, check him out in "The Upside of Anger" with the luminous Joan Allen.)  And Mark Ruffalo, a great serious actor, continues to play lightly as a romantic leading man.  Recently cast with Witherspoon, Garner, and now Aniston in lightweight fluff--I do miss the more challenging roles he used to take on.     But it is Aniston's character, to me, that is a despicable movie creation--one that I've seen all too frequently, but this one is supposed to be endearing.  Born into a life of privilege, she has accomplished nothing in her 30+ years and has become a self-involved and unpleasant "Woman-child."  She floats through her sister's wedding as if it's all some great inconvenience.  She doesn't think twice about mistreating a man who loves her.  She never acts on anything that doesn't blatantly promote her own self-interest.  I'm just so tired of it--it's not charming.  Don't get me wrong--there are plenty of "Man-child" movies too (more so, even) about men who still act as if they were adolescent.  But, think about those movies--the "Man-child" is an object of scorn and ridicule, we laugh at him.  But "Rumor Has It" doesn't ask you to laugh at Aniston's social ineptitude and selfishness--far from it--we're supposed to embrace it and identify with her as a real person.  Well, frankly, I wished everyone in Aniston's life would abandon her because of her behavior so that she'd learn to grow up.  But, of course, this is wish fulfillment--and she learns about life while retaining everything of value--there is never any consequence to being a nasty person.     This gender double standard really bothers me, and the fact that I genuinely disliked the central character--obviously, I didn't care for this film.  Otherwise it would have been a fairly generic picture, but these two things caused me to feel strongly and negatively.  I am giving it an extra star for a good idea, but unfortunately, it didn't pan out for me.   KGHarris, 01/07 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money. 
 Sharks do get Cancer.  The use of Shark Cartilage as a cure for cancer is unfounded and the collection of Shark Cartilage is jeopardizing the ecosystem and hopes and finances of cancer patients.  Please read the research about Shark Cartilage from George Washington University and John Hopkins University, both universities are very well know for their contributions to medical health 
 Well, let's put it this way ...  I bought this when the vinyl was first released.  Went with all the other APP albums I had.  My 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend.    I've since purchased *almost* all the APP CDs that I once had on vinyl.  Not this one.    For me, Pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars.  Love the rest of the first four, as well as Stereotomy and Gaudi -- 4 stars.  I'd give 3 stars to Vulture Culture and Eye in the Sky.  But this one and Eve just didn't do it for me.  On a tangentially related note ... if you haven't heard Godley & Creme's Goodbye Blue Sky, try to find yourself a copy.  A rollicking good time 
 I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.  The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them.  Everything was very 2 dimensional for me.  I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun.  I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy.  But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 A crashing disappointment. Despite the hype of using Welles' "original screenplay", it is evident that director Arau was determined to avoid any hint of Welles' inspired narrative & cinematography. Result: bland city throughout. At 1/10 the budget, Welles 1942 film achieved ten times the artistry in 88 minutes vs. A&E's nominal four hours 
 These reviews are all really suspicious to me....   when someone wins an election with one-hundred percent we call that...fraud.  Anyway, I've seen this book and it ain't all it's cracked up to be.  The consumer should be aware that Berlitz, INC has become a notorious exaggerator of its own worth.  Critiques of Berlitz-related products are often so gushy and ecstatic with delight that they leave the reader believing that they could only have been written by Berlitz staff.    Berlitz products are notorious among foreign-language education professionals for their lack of exercises, their scanty grammatical explanations, their inflated prices, and the flashy pseudo-science of their famous "method" (a gussied-up listen-and-repeat scheme).  The informed consumer will take the time to compare Berlitz "method" products with other, often university-related course supports. The focus of university-generated products is generally less on the marketing and the cultivation of repeat-buyers and more neutrally, disinterestedly geared towards the linguistic enrichment of the student.  The business traveller is particularly ill-served by methods that promise enormous bounds in fluency across short time periods.  These travellers often find themselves seduced by grandiose promises--often while under high-stress conditions [foreign travel, foreign-language presentation preparations]--and end up rather disappointed for having been duped.    Any "method" that claims to produce fast, effortless results is suspect.  Most "methods" are marketing illusions dreamed up by sales teams.    The Berlitz method, in my opinion and in that of many language professionals, is the foreign-language-learning equivalent of a get-rich-quick scheme.   I have been disappointed by their products and teaching in every case I have ever crossed WITHOUT EXCEPTION 
       A delusion does not stop to be a delusion simply because      the majority share it.              Leo Tolstoy  If this text were written by a student, it would be pooh-poohed. However... most of reviewers here gave it five stars. Why? There is the so-called Blatant Nonsense Effect: if they read a blatant nonsense produced by an authority, many will believe it, especially those with herd instincts.  Marketing alchemists are in quest for "laws." Theodore Levitt: "The problem with the marketing con-cept is a persistent tendency toward rigidity. It get dogmatized.  There is not, and cannot be, any rigid and lasting interpretation of what the marketing concept means." But nobody takes heed of that.   Marketing situations are subject to a zillion of circumstances - precisely what make "a rigid dogmatiza-tion" a folly. Also, any result in business is an outcome of joint efforts of many departments.  NO PROOFS - Messrs Ries & Trout prove nothing and do not delineate validity ranges for their "wis-doms."  EXAMPLES - In the ocean of marketing situations you can find examples of whatever, including mu-tually exclusive ones.  IMMUTABILITY - The authors do not know the meaning of "immutable." Physics laws are immuta-ble because they work without exceptions.  The" 22 immutable laws" are rather exceptions. The "im-mutabilis" epidemic is now raging.  READERSHIP - Who is the target readership of the book? Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Harley-Davidson, and a score of other grandees; or millions of SMEs that manufacture useful mundane products? Looks like grandees.  A CLIENT'S MIND - The authors admit that marketing is a game occurring in the mind of a Client. But they provide ample evidence of being absolutely disinterested in this game. So, they overlook the fact that today's Clients are indifferent, cynical, overwhelmed with proposals in any product category, sick of advertising, and armed with the Internet. Clients have scarce personal re-sources: time, attention, memory, interestedness, desire to strain themselves, etc. Are they willing to spend them on trade names? Sometimes yes; mostly not. That's harsh reality. Most of marketing texts ignore it.  SOPHOMORIC REASONING - "There are laws of nature, so why shouldn't there be LAWS OF MARKETING?" - That's logic for you!  FALLACIES and BANALITIES - The book is a collection of easily refuted fallacies and unnecessary banalities.  The FALLACIES: 1. LEADERSHIP - "It's better to be first than it is to be better." How do the authors define "first"? By market share, profits, capitalization, or whatever? A company with the largest share may be not the most profitable. "Get into the mind first" - walk out of your ivory tower and poll whether people know "firsts," etc. One may know the names of a dozen of non-marketing "firsts." But can this idea be mechanistically translated to categories? The "law" suggests that (1) you should not convince prospects; (2) you should not strive to improve your products; (3) ALL the vendors minus one (first) in a category pursue faulty marketing strategies. An ocean of firms fare well without creating a category, many category creators go belly up. Creating a category and "getting into the mind" are uncorrelated things. "You should always try to select a name that can work generically." -  Ironically, Ries in his "22 Im-mutable Laws of Branding" says exactly the opposite. Guys, will you please settle this round the corner. If, of course, you respect the readership. And is you do not want to make fools of yourself.  3. MIND - "It is better to be first in the mind than first in the marketplace." Well, if there is a place available in that mind! Law 1 says it is better to be first than it is to be better.  Law 3 says there is something better still.  4. PERCEPTION - "Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of perceptions." A Client has no perceptions about a sea of products. How is he supposed to purchase them?  5. FOCUS - "The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect's mind." and 6. EXCLUSIVITY - "Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect's mind." Go out and ask people in the street what "words" are owned by thousands of firms.  14. ATTRIBUTES - "For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute." Nonsense. Suppose I use the attribute "good." Will the opposite, i.e., "bad," be more effective?  7. LADDER - "The strategy to use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder." What "strategies" are recommended for each rung? The authors allege that each rung has twice the market share of the rung below it. Much data refute this!  8. DUALITY - "In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race." In rare occasions, e.g., in popular software, this may be the case, but there are thousands of prosperous many-horse lines of business: beverages, sportswear, construction, oil, etc.  9. OPPOSITE - "If you're shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader." "If the leader is STRONG, #2 can occupy his place." Well, and if the leader is WEAK? What is a claimant supposed to do? Not a single example of something "opposite."  11. PERSPECTIVE - "Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time." and 21. ACCELERATION - "Successful programs are not built on fads, they're built on trends." Some marketing effects take place overnight; others, may take years.  The Japanese say that they think ten years ahead; Europeans think ten days ahead; and Americans think ten minutes ahead.   12. LINE EXTENSION - "There's an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand." The authors are dogmatic fighters against line extension although there are lots of successful extensions around.  15. CANDOR - "When you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive." Well, a couple of dubious examples may or may not support this statement.  16. SINGULARITY - "In each situation only one move will produce substantial results." Can you, guys, prove that?  The other "laws" are a collection of banalities. I'll only mention one here:  18. SUCCESS  - "Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance to failure." This "law" splendidly applies to our authors.  GLOOMY CONCLUSIONS - This piece of wishful thinking and fantasia is a disappointment and a disaster. It is insulting for serious professionals.  Also, the book is a litmus paper of the qualification and integrity of the book's 17 academic reviewers - they pronounced this collection of fallacies, banalities, exceptions, wrong prophecies, and downright stupidities the "best marketing book."  Something is rotten in the kingdom of marketing! 
 In "A Whale Hunt", by Robert Sullivan, the main focus is on the effort -- and eventual success -- of the Makah tribe from Washington State in resurrecting their cultural heritage by hunting whales.  The story should be compelling, and Sullivan makes a valiant attempt to share the story from the viewpoint of the tribe.  The problem is that Sullivan apparently decided that it would be too expensive to invest in a proper editor, or that the editors at Simom and Schuster had better things to do than edit this book.  That leaves the reader with the  incomprehensibly difficult task of trying to sort out the grammatical errors. To wit: Page 22, "He is compact and bespectacled, and he was wearing khakis and a polo shirt."  The change of tense in this sentence would have been picked up by even the most junior editor.  Even worse: Page 28, "Harriette talked of being in the Army and about a dream she had that involved a horse, which, to her, had something to do with Christianity being forced on the Indian people, and which became a poem." It was impossible for me to continue to read this book after trying to sort out the meaning of this sentence.  I will save you all the trouble of plodding through this awful book.  A group of native Americans overcomes the objections of the "save the whale" environmental whackos, and in the process manages to recapture some of the heritage that was taken from them by European invaders 
 I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired.  I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time.  The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had.  I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines.  Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John) 
 This short book, written from a Protestant fundamentalist view, reads like a collection  of a few sermons, (certainly not academic!). The authors have a few good insights. For example, that the ecological crisis does not come from Christianity, but from modernity, but then, while praising medieval, traditional Christianity, they don't seem to see that this is contrary to Protestantism. Furthermore most the book rests on special pleading (not even solidly grounded, but using a citation here or there from other fellow protestants), some citations from the Biblical writings or some historical misunderstanding. 
 This book comes across as severely dated and lame.  All the people who love this book are either nerds who think they're in on Pynchon's "joke" or they are nerds who havent read a good book like Catch-22. 
 Don't buy this book. Many of the example essays are hilariously bad. I especially enjoyed the one by the caretaker of a disabled woman who "is the only person standing between her and a nursing home." Yeah, and now she'll be in a nursing home while you pursue a law degree. Good job, there!   I'm convinced that half the 5-star reviews here were written by Montauk himself. I have been through the law school admissions process. The advice in this book is generic at best. Save your money 
 While I had high hopes for this guidebook, I found it a bit topical and overgeneral. Nonprofit organizations would do better to invest in a more thorough, professional introductory guide to the topic of fundraising 
 While the first two books were way overwritten, and often vered more toward Romance Novel than good Fantasy, I had some hope for the story line(s).  As another reviewer points out, there are at least six, with numerous characters.  A cast list would have been helpful.  The third book was a disappointment rather than a redemption.  The editing was, if anything, worse.  She spends an entire paragraph wringing her thesaurus for every possible metaphore for the relation ship with the "moodstone" necklace.  In a clear sign of incompetent editing, our heroine Katla picks up a sword, only to discover three steps later that "no weapon was in reach".  By the third time that each of two sets of characters escapes from the evil clutches of torturers only to be recaptured, I'd had enough.  She is brutal and pointlessly cruel with her characters, and the escalating sadism would have been stomach turning if it wasn't all so overblown and overwritten.  I didn't want to see any more.  Jude Fisher doesn't just need an editor, she needs a therapist 
 It is nice to see that so many writers still believe in a Newtonian universe.  Deterministic, with a Prime Mover.  No bothersome questions about the origins of the universe, no need to explore the vastness of space, and a deep distrust of the possibilities contained in each new generation.  But it's ok.  Darwin loves you, man.   
 Very disappointing.  This product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose.  The "high waist" was always rolling down.  I wasn't expecting miracles; I just wanted to smooth out my silouette while I lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight.  This product was completely useless.  Product has a clever name but that's it.  I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item.  Look elsewhere.    
 This book was something that I read in one day, just to pass the time.  I really didn't care about the characters, and Lara seemed just too unreal to be true.  She was too much of Scarlet O'Hara in her dealings with a real estate world dominated by men.  I only finished it to find out what crisis happened that gave her an empty birthday party, but when I finally came to the end, it wasn't too satisfying 
 Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006)  Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks.  Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on.  Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. * 
 Awful! Just plain awful! A waste of time and money 
 ***Spoilers Ahead***  Towards the end of the book I was absolutly positive there HAD to be another installment in the series because it kept going with no resolution in sight.   Unfortunatly, I was wrong.  In a typically Mercedes Lackey move the book goes on and on and on, following the characters practically day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute and then ends abruptly.   I honestly felt there was no point to most of what I read. It seemed that half of the book was spent following Kellen as he travelled from place to place and back again while he whined over how ruthless he was becoming. Then we spent another good portion of the book reading about Savilla torturing various creatures and walking around naked. And finally, Jermayan, who also seemed to spend half his time just travelling back and forth between cities and camps and so forth. Oh, and let's not foget Cilarnen, who spend most of the book holed up in one place of another while he fiddles around with all his new books and equipment.  Then we get to the end, the final battle, the culmination of all our effort in reading through hundreds of pages of character and plot development....and they wrap it up in MAYBE 30 pages.   There was absolutly no resolution in my mind. It was like the ending was simply an after though: "Oh, yeah, and the good guys win. The end."   The demons are supposed to be a mighty and powerful race but they go down seemingly without a fight. To be honest, I was more intrugued by Kellen and Shalkan fighting the stone mastiffs than I was about the final battle. It was just way to easy, convenient, and stereotypical to be enjoyable.  To end the story, of course, there had to be the relationship resolution. I wasn't bying these flimsy relastionships from the beginning, it was just very fast, very forced and very out of place. So Jermayan gets Idalia....sort of but it was the relationship between Kellen and Vestakia that really got me. They spent most of the trilogy avoiding each other yet somehow manage to fall in love and then at the very end: "Oh, by the way, we can have sex now. I love you."   In all, it was disappointing. Many questions weren't answered and they left a lot of loose threads hanging in their hurry to wrap it all up. If they hadn't spent almost the entire book focusing on the pointless they could have made so much more of it 
 We live in a house on a lake but just bought a St. Louis apartment for weekends, and this book sounded perfect for what I want. I got it home and was  so  disappointed. I don't know know where the "500 solutions for living" are.  This is a pretty picture book but it doesn't have much to say. More than a handful of words would have been nice. Don't buy this 
 This is not bushwick's best work. this cd is not a one star cd the cd should get 3 star's. there are a few song's that are good 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 not a kid - just didn't want to sign up. just saw them with Dylan.  They were horrible - could hardly stand to listen to the - well I wouldn't call it music.  terrible songs, worse voices, awful lighting, luckily couldn't understand the words anyway.  nothing good about this "band" 
 It usually takes me about a week or two to get through a paperback. I've been  struggling to read this every night in bed for two months. It's boring and uninteresting. I quit 
 At least this album doesn't have "Unfaithful", so it gets 2 stars instead of 1.  Seriously though, what house would you want to roll up to, pickin up yo friends listening to this junk?  Might as well put Beyonce in, at least she's classy and has a better vocal range on ballads.  
 While the table looks nice enough do yourself a favor and avoid this.The assembly process is a nightmare and you will find yourself spending HOURS just trying to get the long screws( There are many too so be prepared)to fit into the nuts that you also will have to situate into the cheap wooden frame.The screws much to my shock DO NOT thread into the SUPPLIED nuts that you now have buried 3/4 inch into the frame.No matter how much you turn them and tweak with the nuts inside the frame they often fail to catch.You will find yourself taking whole sides off just because the other side would not latch due to this.  It looks like they packed the thing in a box and  overlooked the assembly process. If you have HOURS nd HOURS to waste on this than buy it .The product looks decent enough.Myself I never saw it done. It was in pieces all over the floor with Nuts and bolts everywhere.I could have went to home depo picked up countless screws and slammed the thing together somehow but by this point I was disgusted with the whole thing.  Avoid this and buy something else 
 This did not work for us at all.  I found that I couldn't get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off.  If you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton 
 I read the reviews here and assumed that a right-leaning bias was informing most of the reviews of the book.  They seemed too harsh to be fair and I dismissed them as coming from the flag-waving "America Does No Wrong" demagogues.  Let's forget the topic and just address the writing.  It's sophmoric- almost embarrassing- to the point I was saying, "I can't believe his editor allowed this."  The emotional confessions are so one-dimensional it reminds me of a third-grader writing, "I am happy.  Today is good for me and my dog."  I'm not going to comment on the reliability of the content.  Fact is, none of us know for certain so it's all speculation.  But the style is awful.  I couldn't finish the book.  Skip this, even if you're a radical-leaning, capitalism-hating anarchist.  Read something better, as recommended by other reviews 
 I couldn't stand this book. I strongly disagree with some of the things he says 
 this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports. their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing, for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be #1 in ranking. often, the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that isn't relevant, or doesn't make sense, or the review isn't consistent with the posted viehicle stats. the magazine also seems to be biased. some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful. after further reading of many issues, you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers, for example, you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically "trash" and a japanese brand or a BMW is always the way to go, when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews. ultimately, its a bad guide towards getting any  information on automobiles period. its the pat robertson of auto magazines. if it were possible, i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star. 
 This movie is so disjointed that you watch it hoping to understand what's going on.  Brad Pitt, who I think is great, walked through his role, what there was of it.  Kate Blanchard was the heroin that you couldn't like.  Everyone else in the movie did what you would expect them to do, no orginality.  I flat cannot recommend this movie to anyone, Academy awards aside 
 This book is a clear example of a teenager's trying too hard to sound world-wise and blase.  It's a book about detachment and nothing, in which rich kids do nothing but take drugs and sleep together and can't even muster up the effort to drive their clearly especially drunk friend home.  Ellis, however, can't let the theme of detachment be subdued and understated, which might have made the book much better; no, he has to hammer it in constantly (for example, two characters decide to have sex but don't even touch each other).  Even worse, he doesn't write very well.  He seems to be trying to sound like Hemingway quite frequently.  Hemingway's long, unpunctuated run-ons, though, are elegant and hypnotic.  Ellis's are just bad.  He goes through different styles, too, seemingly trying to imitate other great writers and sounding only like a kid who hasn't figured out how to write like himself yet.  Appropriate for an eighteen-year-old writing from the point of view of an eighteen-year-old?  Maybe, but it's terrible writing and not worth the effort it takes to read (which is not much).  I am not criticizing the book based on its disturbing themes (drug use, alcohol abuse, eating disorders, gang rape, violent pornography, and prostitution).  Done properly, this novel could be a fascinating and eerily disturbing book.  The problem is that it isn't well written.  We read this book junior year of high school, and I can honestly say that it's the worst book we read.  There's just nothing to it.  It's not a book; it's words on a page, and even more they're the wrong words awkwardly strung together 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 Unfortunately all literary series eventually wind down (witness Spenser)and apparently the Doc Ford novels are following the same progression.  The premise of the novel was a real reach and it seems with each sucessive book Doc becomes more arrogant and RW White expects his readers to suspend their belief a bit too much.  This was a good series but nothing last forever, perhaps it's time to allow Doc to sail off into the Sanibel sunset 
 First of all, let me say that I love the work of Émile Zola. I have read all twenty novels in the Rougon-Macquart saga, and I have to say that in my opinion this is the worst book in the series. The plot revolves around a love triangle between Aristide Saccard (born Aristide Rougon), his second wife Renée, and his son Maxime by his previous marriage. The story takes place in Paris, as Saccard is undertaking a series of shady dealings to amass his fortune. I've always felt that Zola's brand of Naturalism, with its hyper-realistic accumulation of sensory detail, works better when he's dealing with the lower classes than with rich Parisians. In this book his observational thoroughness takes the form of long detailed descriptions of elegant dinner parties and lavishly furnished mansions. All this opulence goes to illustrate the pervasive greed and decadence of the times, but its still rather dull to read through. I imagine the love triangle itself had some shock value for readers of its time, but not so for today's reader. It's hard to take an active interest in any of the three main characters, since they are all so unlikeable. By unlikeable I don't just mean that they're morally reprehensible; they're also not very interesting. Renée is prone to tedious histrionics. Maxime is an ineffectual bore. Saccard is by far the most interesting of the three, but Zola doesn't give him as much ink as the other two. Zola develops the Saccard character much more fully in the far better novel entitled Money (L'Argent). French history enthusiasts will be interested in Saccard's financial endeavors. At a time when Napoleon III and Baron Hausmann are tearing down neighborhoods to make way for grand boulevards, Saccard uses insider information and a knack for wheeling and dealing to profit from all the destruction. I think this novel should only be read by those completists who want to read the entire Rougon-Macquart cycle. For anyone else, there are so many other far-better Zola books (Germinal, The Earth, L'Assomoir, The Debacle, Pot-Bouille, to name a few); don't waste your time on this one 
 I was looking for something like this for months.  It was a new product on Amazon when I did a Froogle search.  Installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when I turned on the light I was disappointed.  My 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. Not much more light than what my lawn lights put out.  During the past two months I've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time.  After being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died.  I haven't even begun to look for a new one.  Very disappointe 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 I must agree with the review that appeared this week in the TLS (Times Literary Supplement, London, 27.01.00), which managed to describe the book without talking about the social character of knowledge - except to say  that Goldman has a 'dirigiste' view of how knowledge should be controlled  and communicated in society. His own euphemism is 'epistemic paternalism',  and readers might want to judge for themselves what it all means, once the  dogmatic philosophising and gratuitous formalising is removed. This reader  found the implications rather scarey, though luckily this philosophical  stuff rarely gets beyond the seminar room. A definite step from back (and  away) from Fuller's work on social epistemology - and even more  conservative types like Kitcher and Longino 
 This album was heralded by Pitchfork. I thought I was in for something phenomenal and captivating. I found nary. Sure the songs are musically shound and the instruments are interesting, but it's nothing that grabs you nor does it make you want to listen to it again. I can't help but feel the singer is often off-key. If you don't like high whiney voices, you definetly don't want this. To conclude, it's good enough music, but what good is it if you don't want to listen to it more than once 
 I'm sure that this review isn't unique.  Spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover, not to mention the ridiculous articles written within. By the time they get done describing the 'euro-punk-indie-pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound' I've completely forgotten the point of thier article.  They must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing. They sound like cyber-nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv.com. I'm sure that i've learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin.  Next time you see it on the stands, I suggest you spin in another direction 
 I loved the idea of this book, and I gave the book 1 star for the idea.  I was anxious to purchase it for my daughters when I found it in the library.  I am very glad we were able to borrow it and I didn't buy it.  I feel portions of this book are inappropriate for children of any age.  These stories could easily have been told without adding so much disturbing imagery to them.  One example is in "Fitcher's Bird" where we find, "The tub was filled with the cut-up bodies of dead girls, who stared at her with sightless eyes."  This is not an image I want in my own mind, much less that of my little girls.  In "The Girl and the Puma," the author states, "Some turned to cannibalism, devouring the flesh of those people who had died before them."  In "Burd Janet," a central theme is a person being "sacrificed to hell."  In Mizilca, a young woman disguises herself as a man and at the end of the story, "she turned around and opened her shirt, so that there was left no doubt in the Sultan's mind that she was indeed a young woman...and beautiful."  Not the type of behavior I want modeled for my daughters.    Another issue is specific to certain girls and is rather picky, but adoptive parents should be forewarned.  Our younger daughter was abandoned at birth in China before we adopted her, and I came across many references that would only be harmful to her.  I would give a very strong warning to parents of children with abandonment issues, as this is a central theme of several of these stories.  We love the Chinese story, "Li Chi Slays the Serpent" and have read excellent retellings of it.  However, in this version, the author writes (unnecessarily, in my opinion),'"Dear parents, since you have brought forth six daughters and no sons, it is as if you were childless.  I am nothing.  I am the sixth nothing in this family."  (For in those days girls were considered of no value in a Chinese family.)'  This would not be edifying to any abandoned Chinese girl.  In "Atalanta the Huntress", `Iasus, a cruel, unfeeling man who took his newborn daughter into the Calydonian forest on the far borders of his kingdom.  There he put her down on the forest floor saying, "I wished for a boy, and this is what I got.  I will not have you."'  In "Molly Whuppie," "There were a man and a wife who had...too many children, and they could not feed them all.  So they took the three youngest and left them in the deepest part of a dark and tangled wood."  (All three of whom happen to be girls.)  I certainly can't read these stories to a child who repeatedly asks me, "You'll never leave me all alone, will you? 
 Jane Monheit's debut album was beguiling, and this outing has a few moments that shine, but for the most part she has grown increasingly absorbed in making hip sounds and doodling around the scale Sarah Vaughn-like: sound without meaning.    On this album, for the most part, she could be an alien replicating human language as an experiment in intergalactic communication.  Where's the emotion?  Where's the feeling?  Ah, youth!  She may have entered the great wilderness of artistic development which in the old days of show business went unrecorded.  One day, perhaps, she will start concentrating on the meaning of the words she's singing again, and stop sounding like an ultra hip midi file.  
 The one star is not really for the novel, but for this edition of it.  If, like me, you have read this and are looking to purchase a copy, this has an attractive cover.  However, it is not clear from the product description that this edition of the novel is in the form the author originally submitted to his editor, and not the edition originally published.  Accordingly, Willie Stark is Willie Talos throughout this novel.  Even though this may have been the author's original intention, I absolutely hate that it's a different edition from the novel I read and loved.  I will be returning it and purchasing an older edition without this reversion 
 I was surprized to get this book on modeling, and it had no photographs. It had advice that any model agency would give you with a simple phone call. I would not reccomend it at all.. sorry.. 
 This is a difficult novel to review as it is really three intertwined novellas.  The book is divided into three sections, and the story and the action are very different in each of the three.  This is a tale of the discovery by a team of archaeologists of an ancient Mycaenaen artifact of immense power.  The first part of the story centers around the efforts of the protagonists to smuggle out the unknown artifact.  The explanation developed by Benford here is totally implausible.  The protagonists are trying to steal an artifact (national treasure really) from its country of origin (Greece) during a coup/civil war for no better reason than to prevent it from falling into the hands of a man who made an inappropriate pass at the main character.  A poorly justified, not particularly well written escape/evasion story.  After having successfully absconded with it to Boston, MA, they then try to discover what it is.  This section is, in my opinion, outstanding, and may, for certain readers, more than justify the cost of the book.  Benford writes with incredible accuracy about Cambridge, about MIT and BU, and about how a scientific investigation would proceed if something like this were actually found.  I agree though with many of the negative reviewers that Benford (a physicist himself) describes the object and its physics in too much detail for the average reader.  This level of detail, while of interest to other physicists, detracts from the story for most readers.  The process of investigation into the properties of the artifact by the physicists as described by Benford is, however, absolutely realistic and outstanding, as is his descriptions of the culture and bureaucracy of the Boston universities.  If you want to understand how scientists would study such an object in a science fiction setting, this is among the best that has been written. In the third section, they try to recover the artifact after it was stolen by the baddie and returned to Greece.  The third section is totally brainless, a mindless `let's send the commandos in and blow everything up' story.  Overall, Benford had a good idea with this novel, but it was poorly executed on several levels, and I would not recommend spending your money on this book with the caveat above 
 (Hey, this review is supposed to be 5 stars! What's up with the editing?)   O. K.   Get ready.   Take a ...deeeeeeep ....breath.....   This book, written in 1991, is about to become relevant again!  Yergin's "hydrocarbon man" is alive and well and living in the 21st century.  No book has ever captured the excitement, risk, and reward of the oil business like this volume does. Daniel Yergin documents oil patch history, from the simple beginnings as a native american medicine to todays complex international traffiking.  Truely, hydrocarbon extraction from the subsurface is the stuff of modern life.  Try to live without the carbon-hydrogen bond and you'll find out what life is like with an odd-even social-security-number lottery for the gas chamber. (Maybe I exaggerate a bit, but trust me... you don't want to look down this road.)  My advice:  Buy this book!   Buy it today!   Read it as soon as you receive it!   The next day may be too late!    (As I write this, gasoline prices rose today by about 8 cents because of the Alaskan pipeline.)     Also, thank your local geologist. And buy him a beer 
 We've had this for about five years.  The battery went dead but THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THE BATTERY.  The battery is soldered to the circuit board!  They expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost $20 each way!  I opened it up, cut out the old battery, and duct-taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months.  Cooks rice great, though

 F. Paul Wilson's Lovecraft-inspired horror follows an ill-fated group of Nazis who attempt to occupy a small castle high in the mountains of Romania and quickly learn that the Keep is occupied by something else both menacing and powerful, forcing them to call in a folklorist and who happens to be Jewish.  It is ironic, or perhaps fitting, that H. P. Lovecraft (a champion of eugenics) should provide the inspiration for a novel in which Nazis feature as both villains and victims.  Wilson's characters are well-rounded; considering the setting and subject matter, it is impressive that he produces Nazis who are both vicious and sympathetic, and treats a number of worldviews with at least nominal respect before sweeping them away and presenting the novel's own fantastical pseudo-history.  Though the scenario is largely conventional, it is truly thrilling, but unfortunately, Wilson inflicts a fatal wound on his otherwise competent novel by inserting an agonizing love story that could find a home in the schlockiest Harlequin.  When it comes to love (or more accurately, lust), Wilson knows all the cliches.  From its stilted beginnings to its hackneyed and gratuitous sex scene, this prime example of bad storytelling proves to be the novel's true horror.  It poisons the whole work, and Wilson even allows it to destroy what could have been a powerful (and Lovecraftian) conclusion 
 We ordered one each for our son and daughter.  They are not what we were expecting.  No lyrics to the songs just music.  We are returning them and will shop for items like this in a store so we can have a better idea of what we are getting.  I do have to say the shipping was very fast, hopefully the processing on the return will be just as fast 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 A quiet deliberate movie ultimately suffers from having too much star power. No matter how scruffy and wain the filmmakers try to make Nicole Kidman look, she's still Nicole Kidman. Her portrayal of a janitor really pushes the limits of "suspension of disbelief" with her delicate features and legs that go on forever.   And Anthony Hopkins is also miscast as a Jewish professor with a hard knock, secret past. While he remains one of my favorite actors, he cannot escape his "Britishness" which is even more unbelievable once you discover what his character's past is! The real discovery of this film is Wentworth Miller's absolutely astonishing turn as the teenage Anthony Hopkins.   Ultimately, the film is worth seeing for Wentworth Miller alone. But the casting of two megawatt Hollywood actors hurts the believability of this film in the end 
 Dozois prefers the long short story or what might be called the condensed novel, and most of these stories are in that vein. Very few stories here are short. Dozois also prefers stories that are more about millieu and atmosphere rather than stories filled with metaphor or operate on some kind of ironic level (as did the stories in the old Wollheim/Carr anthologies). Perhaps this is due to the kind of science fiction being written today: it's mostly about predictable futures or predictable alien cultures, long on atmosphere and short on story. Many stories, in fact, don't really get going (the McDonald, the Reed, the Gerrold, the Turtledove) for several pages. (I was halfway through the McDonald before I had any understanding what the story was about, let alone what its conflict was--the story had almost no dramatic tension).    And there are a lot of lost opportunities. Robert Reed's story involves a ship larger than several worlds, but ends up becoming a mere - and unexciting - detective story. The trope or conceit of living in a HUGE space ship is lost both on Reed and the protagonist. What would human life be like if one were traveling the rim of the galaxy in a giant spaceship? Wouldn't that DO something to you? Well, apparently not. The story becomes just another murder mystery that needs to be solved.  The same is true of the David Gerrold story. It's a time travel story involving "timequakes" in the L.A. region (brilliantly realized by a man who's lived there all his life) but becomes devolves into a rather sordid homoerotic detective story in the end (with an ending that's so cliched that I'm surprised Gerrold let himself get away with it). And some of the stories are plain unpleasant, such as the Vonda McIntyre story. How it ended up here I have no idea. Another odd choice is the Alastair Reynolds story, "Along the Aquila Rift". I'm surprised that ANY editor published it: imagine a story told in the first person where, in the end, the person forgets what he has just told you. As a creative writing teacher, I would NEVER have a student tell a story in the 1st person and have it end: "And then I died" or "And then I was given amnesia". One can justifiably wonder how the heck the story got written down in the first place. How did it appear on the printed page?  (Alan Brennert, an otherwise notable writer, won a Nebula years ago by writing a story told by a ghost. I guess fantasy and science fiction writers can do things that mainstream writers cannot. Or perhaps everyone's taking their cues from John Gardner's GRENDEL wherein the monster, telling his tale, is, as we all know, killed in the end. I would let Gardner get away with the conceit, not so Mr. Reynolds. I want my money back!)   This anthology really is a collection of stories that Dozois would have published had he seen them all for Asimov's Science Fiction. To his credit, he has culled many of these from internet and other non-traditional publishing sources. But mostly these stories weren't a lot of fun, and most took a lot of patience to wade through. I did like the Wolfe story; but, again, the conceit of the story gets lost in a twist ending that can only be appreciated if one has endured a bad marriage and suffered inklings of spousal revenge. I miss Donald Wollheim and Terry Carr and Judith Merrill and Frederick Pohl and Groff Conklin. What happened to stories that were fun? Where is the sense of wonder here? Yes, there are dazzling depictions of India in the future and the wonders of genetic engineering and nanotechnology, but, really, who cares? What is present in this volume are stories written by the very best we have. But they're like weightlifters with these enormous muscles lifting really tiny weights. Is it because they have to crank out two stories a month and three novels a year in order to make a living? Find an old anthology edited by Damon Knight called THE DARK SIDE. It's out there somewhere. It's far better than these anthologies--collections that suggest a paucity of imagination in our field that's been around now for about twenty years. These people, and this editor, can do MUCH better than this 
 This book does takes America's False Images of Islam (murdering terrorists) and shows how there are not only true, but even more true.  Findley is able to get a few moderate folks to say some nice things.  But what they can't do is say anything nice about democracy, Israel, the Jews, women's rights, etc 
 I found the book disappointing in that it depends on the interpretation of experience being a legitimate means of proving the existence of a deity.  I don't need this book for that.  Also the christological bent of this author is offputting, giving the sense that he's not able to step back far enough to sense whether his views are in truth as objective as he pretends them to be, or as I sense them to be, subjective wishful thinking 
 I came of age during this era and am about as conservative as you can get.  However, this book oversimplifies the way the Cold War was won.  Yes, Ronald Reagan did a great deal and deserves most of the credit for pushing a Soviet Empire over the economic brink upon which it was already standing.  However, O'Sullivan, a Brit and a Catholic, gives far too much credit to Thatcher and John Paul II.  I suppose that being a Brit and a Catholic, you might guess that he would do so.  But, really, he makes some stretches and assumptions about how the Soviets reacted to Thatcher and JP II that are tenuous at best.  Overall, there is nothing new in this book that isn't already known.  Reagan stood up to a U.S.S.R. which was already failing and, thus, caused it to break up more rapidly.  We already knew that - over a decade ago we knew that.  Whatever Thatcher and JP II were doing were mere coincidences to Reagan's actions - coincidences that O'Sullivan vastly overplays, if not invents.  Check this one out at the library or borrow it from a friend and save your money 
 The movie isn't a movie. Its a preview. It's only 20 minutes long for ...that isn't even funny. Its a waste of money and time in your life 
 I thought I would love this but just returned it.  It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time (10 minutes?)  Maybe I'm too small (5'2")or my baby (5 months and 18 pounds) is too large.  Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable.  I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn, but I couldn't stand wearing!  Very painful 
 This flick naivishly glorifies infidelity and portrays a skewed, contemptible version of human relationships in a bland, insipid fashion. It redundantly mulls over a menage a trois, a concept that has been done to death by every genre of alt cinema around the globe, in an incredibly heartless and dispassionate manner.   It also fails to capture the subtle impacts of human emotions of the male characters, but prods along in an absolutely insensitive manner. The movie merely concentrates on the feminine perspective and doesnt detail the impact of the wife's infidelity on her husband's emotional psyche either. It could even be termed utterly dishonest, purely due to the injustice it does to the poor, innocent husband's character.  This is one of the few movies, where I liked absolutely nothing. I even found something worthwhile in the sexually deviant Cronenberg's flick - Crash - but this one utterly a waste of time 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's basically a movie about 3 kids who grew up together only one was emotionally scarred for life as a child. As they grow up they all go their seperate ways until another horrific event brings them all together again for one more sad, unsettling experience together. Does anyone grow or learn anything? No. Do the "bad guys" pay? No. It is difficult for me to say just how much this movie sucks without giving away the ending. Suffice to say that no one wins, innocent people get screwed over, and in the end - no one really learns anything. It's a thoroughly depressing movie with no point - unless the point is that life sucks. As if viewers don't have enough of their own problems, or as if real life isn't traumatizing enough - we are subjected to this horrible 2 1/2 hours of misery. I am not exaggerating - there is no redeeming value to this movie. Sure the acting is great, but what good is it with such a tragic story. And this is not like a Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare Tragedy - there are no heroes, no lessons to be learned, no moral to the story - it just makes you feel miserable and hollow and then nothing - just the credits rolling. This movie is so terrible that I would rather watch "Kazaam" than watch this again 
 ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS, PAYS THEM NOTHING, AND ROBS THEM BLIND. DO NOT PURCHASE BOOKS FROM THEM OR FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. BOYCOTT THESE THIEVES!! 
 I bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the SmartMedia (which only lasts for about a month). I would have to say that I am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. Even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the PowerShot SD1000, my old Olympus Camedia C-2020 takes much better photos.  It's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. So blurry that I had to use Photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. The right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable.  Maybe I simply got one with a bad lens. In any case, no thanks, I'll stick with my trusty old camera. I would rather pay for a new SmartMedia card each month.  
 Recently renewed my subscription after a three year hiatus and I couldn't believe my eyes.  The magazine is a skeleton of its former self, with slim stories and little science.  Bob Guccione Jr's mag is not even that fun to read.  On the happier side, the magazine appears to shun its earlier environmental preoccupations 
 It doesn't fit - I got my size.  I don't know why it doesn't fit but I'm not taking all the time to send it back.  Both bras I got didn't fit.  Sigh 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
  As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about 
 I have never read dialogue so contrived in my entire life. The tension between Adam and Becca had not point of origin. The tension between Adam and Tyler was stereotypical, to say the least. The way the author ridded the characters and reader of any residual guilt/frustration/regret in regards to Tyler was totally unrealistic and disgustingly half-hearted. Such a cop out! The entire "love" story was based on notions of "Gee, you're hot! I wanna have sex with you! We must be in love!" When, at a rather crucial moment Adam said "Even my molecules are horny" I stood up, threw the book across the room, and laughed for ten mintues straight. I didn't keep it or sell it; I threw it in the bin where it belongs. It was utter trash 
 From a first-time macroeconomic student's point of view, this book sucked. The glossary was very poor making it troublesome to look up unfamiliar terms. Each chapter makes frequent reference to charts and graphs that are located several pages away, causing you to have to shuffle back and forth between pages, trying to decipher difficult new concepts. This book also assumes some prior knowledge of economic concepts, and moves very quickly through progressively more complex material. Thumbs down from a new student's perspective 
 Conseco claims to have written this book to reveal steroids dominating presence in baseball; however it seems he just wanted to upset as many people as possible with its publication.  Juiced is Conseco's elementary cry for justice.  He unapologetically admits to steroid use and acts as if he is a martyr for the betterment of baseball.  He points fingers, name drops, and defends every blemish of his career in this "memoir."  Constantly referring to the "double-standard" in baseball, he fails to suggest any remedy or efforts to solve the problem.  His book openly criticizes whites, women, owners, managers, government agencies, trainers, reporters, and is bound to make you mad too 
 It is true, the pages fall out faster than you can use them. And the puzzles are not jumble like in a real game. For example, in a real game no one stops to tell you, "ok look for an X-ray Attack"... and so the book is not helpful. Instead, I recommend- "Sharpen Your Tactics 
 I purchase this press, and was totally disappointed with this product. It takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press, than with an iron. I will be returning 
 When Ms. Palmer re-issued this boring, boring book, she should have had her "hero" quit smoking.  I simply cannot imagine poor Kate being swept away by passion from this walking ashtray of a cowboy.  Every time the two got together for a steamy kiss, Jason had to take his cigarette out of his mouth to kiss Kate.  How many ways can you say gross?  I guess smoking wasn't so politically incorrect back in 1988 when this book was first published, but romantic heroes these days just don't smoke!  She also should have looked over the dialogue a little...so stilted 
 Who would have believed that this absurd melodrama would have garnered such critical plaudits?  It's reads like Psycho meets Darby O'Gill.  No one in Ireland talks like the people in this play "do be talking".  Utterly offensive nonsense 
 Maria Shriver's book, "Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went Out into the Real World" really could have been written by an 8th grader in 45 minutes.  Here is a person whose uncle was President John F. Kennedy, one of the greatest Prsidents of the USA.  Ms. Shriver has written a rather simplistic booklet on life.  Her husband is the current governor of California.  With all that experience one would think that a more sophisticated write would abound.  However, we find this booklet a simple 20 minute read.  One star is a gift to this "book" 
 I enjoyed everything else I have read from Harry Harrison, and am fascinated by alternative history, so I expected to like this book. I didn't.  I think it does credit to the American reviewers who have criticised this book that it went down nearly as badly with them as it did with Brits. They have demonstrated that one comment by a British reviewer - that this book provides an insight into the American mind - is unfair to most Americans.  The starting premise - Britain blundering into war with the North in the American civil war - is horrifying plausible, which is not surprising as this very nearly happened. The first part of the book, up to that stage, is well done.  However, the author then abandons any attempt at either a realistic attempt to work through what might have happened, or to look sympathically at how the situation might have developed from the viewpoint of all sides. Instead, looking for a way to turn both the USA and CSA into heroes, he casts the Brits as utterly incompetent and evil cretins who both sides can unite against.  Although it isn't a positive for me to read a book in which my country is shown in a bad light, this doesn't usually make it impossible for me to enjoy a work of fiction. Heaven only knows Britain has had it's share of reverses and like every other country in the world has been responsible for some stupid or wicked mistakes. However, the increasingly implausible idiocy through which this book has the British blundering into war against both parties in the American civil war is way over the top. The idea that a Commander in Chief of any civilised nation could simultaneously be moronic enough to commit the acts attributed to the Duke of Cambridge in this book, and clever enough to prevent his own government finding out what he had done and sacking him, is  ludicrous beyond belief.  Harry Harrison is almost the last writer on earth I would have expected to prostitute his enormous talents with such chauvinistic rubbish. One-sided nationalism is not usually his style at all, and he has written another book about a set of events which might have changed the course of the US Civil War/War between the States - "Rebel in Time" - which is far  superior to this.  The market for this book is people who like America, hate the   British, and are not too bothered about historical plausibility. So it may sell some copies in the USA, and probably a few in Ireland (though as I'm married to an Irish catholic girl I think I'm qualified to say that not everyone in Ireland falls into these categories.) In the rest of the world most of those who don't like the Brits don't like the USA either, and would be even less sympathetic to the CSA.   For anyone who is looking for a good account of how the American Civil war might have gone wrong, try Harry Turtledove's "The Guns of the South," or "How Few Remain" and the "Great War" and "American Empire" trilogies which follow it. Or indeed Harry Harrison's "Rebel in Time" 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 I purchased this book when my husband was diagnosed with kidney cancer last summer (June 2006). I was hoping for some real insight into the process of healing and opening oneself to the channel of healing. I found the book very disappointing. There was nothing in it that inspired my husband in any way nor gave us any insight as to how to investigate the process of opening oneself to the miracle of healing. I was miraculously healed of Multiple Sclerosis in November of 1975 and have conducted many retreats and workshops on "Self Awareness and Healing" across the United States. I had hoped that Adam might have some further insight into the healing phenominan and that I could gain further insight in order to help my husband and others. I read the book aloud to my husband and he,too, was disappointed in the content of the book. I learned nothing new from this book nor found it to be particularly inspirational. My dear husband passed away in October 2006 and received the greatest healing of all, death. He is now in the presence of our Lord and is where I want to be someday 
 I am doing a self study and do not have any facility to get help of any instructor. I purchased the book after got good reference from some of my friends. The content of the book is pretty good...BUT when it comes to the problems...there are a very very few worked out examples (as usual they are the easiest ones)...Addition to that the publisher decided to earn every bits of pennies. So they created a Student's solution manual. No where in the publisher's site anything mentioned about the manual. But when I purchased , found that the manual has solution for ONLY Odd numbered solution (for them the answers are given in the original book). I was wondering whether they have another solution manual for EVEN numbered problems...!!!  The instructor's manual is out of stock and you cannot download it from the publisher's site (unless you are an Instructor which I am not).  Now I am wondering how I can get help on the even numbered problems....any idea?? 
 I was dreaming to see this movie for a long time, since 1997. And finally I bought it in Europe for 10 Euro. So what did I find there? Nothing, there is lack of everything. Anyone can shoot something like this, adding clowns in movie does not make it masterpiece. It is not that I do not like David Lynch's movies but here Mr. Lynch and some other people simply wanted to make money. One of the worsest movies ever seen 
 This book offers nothing new in terms of improving your chess.  He brings no new ideas, no new methods, other than to study tactics.  Nothing in the book is composed by him, the vision drills, or anything else. Actually 99.9% of the work involved refers to chess software (CD Art 3.0) as a guideplan.  If you are into 5 minutes abs, or get rich quickly type of programs then this book is for you.  The author himself does not play anymore, as you can see at: http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?12775875 If tactics is an issue for you I would recommend CD Art 3.0 directly rather than buying this book and listing to this guy rave on how he did it. Jeremy Silman puts it very well in his article about the book at http://www.jeremysilman.com/book_reviews_jd/jd_rapid_chess_improv.html There is no such a thing as rapid chess improvement.  I would recomend any other book on tactics that the authour actually spent time composing or selecting them 
 This step stool is not worth it - the steps that are shown extended in the photo connect only via a plastic groove in the red plastic cross bars shown on the legs of the stepstool.  Therefore, when you move the stool, the steps flop along.  You have to move them out yourself and put them back in yourself.  They come off too easily so you are having to place them inside the groove whenever you move the stool/chair.  The stool itself is very small and while this is OK for a stationary perching stool, it is NOT good for a step stool and too small and uncomfortable as a seat 
 I put this audiobook in my Wish List several weeks before it came out.  What I was hoping for was some good info on the psychology and execution of the lost art of conversation. What I got was an endless list of do's and do nots.  I ONLY recommend this for EXTREME introverts.  If you are looking to polish your social skills or socialize with anyone other than friends then keep looking 
 This board is attractive, but has never been accurate. I've had others use it, and they think the same.  I do not recommend it 
 I purchased Eldredge's "Wild at Heart", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given "Waking the Dead" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.   John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like "The Matrix" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.   The author also presents the image of God as "my friend". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.   This is exactly the same theology as building the largest "Christian" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to "offend anyone". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.   Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of "setting hearts free". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not "free" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, "Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.   For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend "The Way of the Master" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.  
 Hateful liberals once again undermine their so-called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the US population. They claim to be tolerant and open-minded toward all lifestyles,religions, races etc... but that open-mindedness obviously shouldn't apply to people who disagree with them. Throughout the "book," Moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people. If you like this book, I also recommend Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Both "books" are jam-packed full of hate. 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 This book was really a disappointment. Some passages were lifted verbatim from her other books--which made me feel ripped off. In "Moving On," she describes how the clutter in her house got out of control to the point where she had a psychic specialist come in. The psychic said the house was "weeping." Sarah then found out soon after that her husband was having an affair and the house was "protecting" her with its clutter. That's an interesting enough story--EXCEPT that she told the exact same story in "Simple Abundance," only the person having the cluttered house problem was her friend--not Sarah. So, which story are we supposed to believe?  This book seems so thrown together. I think she should've taken another year or so to flesh it out, to use all new stories and to find a really good editor.   I just don't feel the same about any of her books now 
 I wanted to like this book.  I wanted to learn something about the modern rise of anti-semitism.  Sometimes, you just don't get what you want.  I read the book, hoping to answer some serious questions: Is anti-Zionism the same as anti-semitism ?  Are Jewish anti-Zionists experiencing self-hate ?  Is the rise of European anti-semitism a product of long lasting traditions or a by-product of Muslim immigration ?  I still have these questions.  The book does attempt to address these issues.  It does so by a selectively culling statements, events, and quotes.  Where a book of this nature would demand 100's of pages, the author here feels that his cobbled collection of editorials can address these issues with limited research and less than 200 pages.  It is tragic that such a serious topic is handled, so casually.  Like many people, I fear a second Holocaust prompted by Iranian nuclear ambitions.  What does Schoenfeld think of this issue ?  He agrees that such a threat exists, but sees fit to address it in only one paragraph.  What about a solution to the rise of anti-semitism ?  The only one I can find, is the belief that a stable democratic Iraq will reduce the phenomena.  I don't want to get too political here, but that's a pretty disquieting source of optimism.  There is something here, but there's not quite enough.  I don't disagree with the author, but I don't feel that throwing out a collection of individual opinions constitutes a serious analysis of a serious topic. 
 This movie is virtually a complete copy of Rock Around the Clock. It looked ordinary, the songs were quite boring- apart from the title track. Did not really enjoy any of it - acting was poor - songs were poor - being  a copy of the rock movie I felt like I was watching the same movie but with poor preformances . Very disappointed.  
 Until the moment the cd didn't still arrive.   What do make?   How can I trace?      Respectfully,   Mirtes Marin 
 I guess I'll be the only one here with a bad review of this Hitchcock movie.  Though we have a very original story here, I was amazed at feeling that the actors were saying their lines at the camera, not at the opposite actor. And flatly at that! Never have I seen it show as much (and I have seen a lot of movies!!!). Nobody seemed convinced of what they were doing. We all know that Dietrich is not the best actress in the world(more an extraordinary personality)but here, she is cold as ever. Wyman is better... and Sims is the treasure of the lot, with much life to his character.  However, at the risk of looking a bit out of order , I still encourage you to see it. I am not a Hitchcock fan, but I believe we learn to appreciate by viewing many different movies.. 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 Deep Deceptions Was Not what it was advertised to be. In the advertisement it was to explain about how The Divinci Code just scratched the surface. The dvd talks about heaven and hell and nothing new or different about religion 
 As another reviewer states the original had 150 color plates this version has only 8 in mine. The visual phenomena are so complex that without the plates you can't possibly accurately understand what the book is talking about. Sure you could make you own examples, but if you did, you would NOT be sure, given the complex examples, that you understood what the author was talking about. Instead you will have a false understanding or incomplete understanding that will make you look foolish. The publisher is cashing in on the author's previous great work without really republishing it. This is the lowest I've ever rated a book 
 If you are looking for a biography on Daphne Du Maurier, I would not recommend Haunted Heiress.  This is a rambling, free form work of literary criticism.  You would do better to check this book out from the library rather than paying the steep price.  You can learn more about the story of Du Maurier's life by doing a web search.    Also, if you are interested in visuals, there are none in Haunted Heiress, save for the cover. The text did conjure up some mental images of Ms. Auerbach, though... (narcissistic, cranky, and snobbish) but none of Daphne Du Maurier.   I did very much appreciate Ms. Auerbach's observations on Du Maurier's affinity for the way men can live their lives, with more freedom and flexibility.   I wish Ms. Auerbach would have done more research on Du Maurier's life and interwoven it with her pop-up thoughts on this book or that 
 I've read through several compiler texts over the past few months as I work away on a compilers project for school.  I would have to say that this text, the required textbook for my class, is not in the least bit useful.  Most of the material in the book is not covered in any real depth.  If you are looking for a useful book on compilers, I would recomend "Compilers" by Aho, Sethi and Ulman (the Dragon Book), or "Crafting a Compiler" by Fisher and LeBlanc.  Both books are much more thorough.  The Fisher's book is also quite easy to read and understand.  Appel's books only saving grace is the occasional modern view of things 
 Am totally dissatisfied with ths wagon as it came dented.  The wagon is shipped in a cardboard box with no styrofoam or other packing - the wagon bed absorbs any impacts.  The parts are in the bed and there is cardboard to prevent scratching - there were no scratches and the finsih was nice.  The pacaging is totally inadequate.  I would return the wagon if time permitted.  I am glad that I am not giving it to a child as a gift.  Buy it where you can look it over first to be sure it's not damaged 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
  I have read five of the Elm Creek novels and enjoyed all for different reasons. This one I can't say was that great. The author kept repeating the facts over again with each character and it began to get very boring. I wanted to skip sections and move on. I would have prefered more quilting tips and information regarding quilts and less scandals 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 On my second one now...Not that I liked it much the first time, just that it is the only brand they sell in the local store here.  I will say that while it worked, it worked...I mean, it killed some bugs!  These, however, are my problems with it:  Bulbs burn out fast!  Like after four to six months...And the replacement bulbs are almost as much as I paid for the whole unit!  The thing gets jammed up with bugs and there is no easy way to clean it.  Finally, it doesn't appear to be very weatherproof.  The first one died after a storm and the one I have now has just died.  I think I am buying a different brand on here...One that works for more than a few months 
 After first buying WR's "Heavy Weather" I'd have to say that this album really disappointed me. Now it does have it's moments(nubian sundance), but all in all, I'm just not feeling this one.I didn't like the sound quality...but it wasnt all about that though. As opposed to "Heavy Weather" Songs like "Cucumber slumber" sound dated...Kinda puts me in the mind of a bad 70's blaxploitation movie, while other songs just plain put me to sleep. Basically it just doesn't have that funky/rock/jazzy sound that Jaco Pastorius brought to the mix. 
 You know, yesterday, 20/20 aired yet ANOTHER report featuring a major climatologist whose reports regarding global warming are regularly edited and grossly redacted by the president's folks to make it sound as if global warming is just a gnat in the wind.  I read this book. I cannot imagine how anyone can accuse the world's climatologists of "false science" with a straight face.   Both the author and his supporters -- like ardent right-wing "journalist" John Stossel (a lightweight reporter with a third-rate intellect)are idealogues who are TRYING to prove wrong opinions that, if correct, will mean the death of earth.   What kind of people are these? Why would ANYWONE try to convince others that this is not happening when the consequences, if they are wrong and able to convince enough people, will be horrific?   Anti-science is the work of idiots and fools, people who correctly observe that you can't be rational, which science is, and believe that some god will not visit horror on the earth.  This book is earnest and stupid 
 What a disappointment! The book deals with a key element of software development but unfortunately lets the reader down in so many ways! While the topics covered should have been useful, I suspect that the most common word in the book was "I" - as the author regales the use with instances where his apparently superior and hothouse intellect saved the day. Instead, a concise but generalised explanation would have done and been illustrative.  Similarly, the book is filled with torturous language and passages absolutely berefit of meaning; for example pg 107 "Now it's time to reflect on how simple TagBuilder is and how easy it is for clients to use. Is there a simpler way to produce XML? This is not the kind of question you can answer right away. Experiments and hours, days, or weeks of reflection can sometimes yield a simpler idea. I'll discuss a simpler implementation in the Variations section below. For now, I move on to the last step. " on page 111 we finally got to the above mentioned Variations section in the interim 40+ references to "I" and "WE".  Finally, the author appears so in love with refactoring and artistic code that I really believed he exceeded good practice and drove towards refactoring to the infinitely useless. Several scattered recomendations to constrain class size to 10 lines of code and recommendations on how do so completed the picture for me. Too many flowers and not enough Vulcan warriors would be a good summary.  Last year, I led a large team in succesfully completing 40 Million Euro of software. (Yes, the sale value as sold to the customers) and commercially, i am not sure I would have a place in my team for such a polarised thinker 
 I started to use Lonely Planet 15 years ago. I can say that I am a witness of how much quality deteriorite it has been. I used to just buy it by default. It was a Bible for me. But, a BIG but, this Lonely Planet Australia set a new lowest standard for the series.  First of all, it had so old information. The hostels listed in the book in Sydeny probably were closed more than 5 years ago. One hostel in bondi beach that I wanted to go that was listed in the book. When I showed up in the hotel address, there was a internet café and pub. No hostel at all.  Second. The most unbelieveable of all, the book I have, which is 2004 version, has no mention at all about the Olympic Village in Sydeny. Oh my God! Sydney Olympic was in 2000. Can you believe that after 4 years, they still didn't update it? I was reading it again and again, before I throw this book away to trash can, I still didn't belive that they can omit all the information about Olympic, like the village, the boat to go there, like the stadium... they pretend that there is no such a thing!  I know that Lonely Plante started many years ago in Australia, by some Australian backpackers. So it is a REAL shame that Lonely Planet Australia is so bad. If there is negative score, I will give that. As one star is minimum, I have to give that. But my true belief is that this book deserves negative 5 stars!! 
 I have to agree with Anna Hope's review.  This book was so painfully lame that I gave up on it two-thirds of the way through and stopped wasting my time...something I very rarely do.  But this book, while starting excitingly, soon dwindled into boredom and I realized that I could definitely put it down.  I didn't care about the two main characters nor what happened with the storyline.  As far as St. Giles being beyond compare, try Kresley Cole.  Now THAT's writing; her books I hate to put down 
 It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the  myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other  than that, it's an interesting read 
 Of course reviewing a book by its cover is ridiculous, but this catalog's cover keeps slipping off, which is annoying enough to merit a mention. And then there are those stupid fold out pages, so I spend half the time like a tourist trying to manage an unruly map, and inevitably they rip. As for the content, well, the text descriptions of some of the artists use interesting terms like "conceptual trigger," but the photos of the art itself are small and dull on thin, uncoated paper. And as the descriptions of the artists read more like frommers than lonely planet (I.e. positive only), it's hard to value the text too much. Buy the "PS1 Greater New York 2005" instead. You can get more out of the Whitney book by googling the artists' names.  I should say that the introduction by Chrissie Iles and Philippe Vergne is superb, but you can read that online:  [... 
 Very poor analysis of West African civilizations. For example, Ghana was a very significant Soninke empire in Western Africa, yet barely any attention at all is paid to it. To make matters worse, the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been "founded by whites from the North". Fact is, there were no "whites" to the North. The only light skin berbers nearby were mixed-race "browns". 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 This song only made me feel extremely sad. I hated it. Was it supposed to be backhanded uplifting or something 
 This book's explanations vary from poor to excellent. The derivations, while they are given, are not well done. They often skip steps that leaving the reader wondering just how they got from point A to point B. The answers in the back of the book and in the instructor's solutions manual are also often incorrect. The publisher of this book also elected to put large sections of this book online instead of in the book. An entire chapter, the astrophysics section, is online, which is absolutely ludicrous for such an expensive book. Overall, this book just doesn't cut it 
 Sometimes a writer's bias is so transparent that you don't even need to develop a rebuttal. You simply acknowledge his bias and respect his right to express his extreme, albeit twisted, view of the world.   Goozner is an economist, I majored in economics in both undergrad and grad school, the rest of my education is in chemistry, molecular biology, business and law. He writes about academic research, I have worked at National Laboratories and well known universities. He writes of the pharmaceutical industry, where I spent nearly a decade. And he writes about the biotechnology industry, where I spent another decade. Amazingly, all my life I have spent discovering and developing drugs. So I think I can say I read this book not as a layman, although at times it seemed to be written by one.   I usually enjoy books that are critical of things. They have a tendency to keep us honest and make us all too aware of our faults. But this book, while laudable for its story telling and historical walkabout, did not really get to a point where it stood on firm ground. So in the end, it was so overstated in its extremism, I could not take it seriously. Any good point that could have been made was underminded in its credibility by statements at times so braced by sheer nonsense, I felt bad for the author. I never did take this book seriously.  Goozer is one of those folks that does not believe the constitution is correct to provide protection to inventions through patents. Nor does he seem to believe in capitalism. Rather, he posits that pure open academic research is all that is needed to develop drugs. To him, the Bahy-Dole Act was a license for the pharmaceutical industry to steal from academia.  He would have us believe that all the great drugs developed today really come from academia. If you believe that, then you believe that the internet, as we now know it, including Amazon.com itself, came 100% from academia. Well no Mr. Goozner, Netscape founders and developers of Mosaic did indeed develop their "inventions" at the University of Illinois, but it took good old capatilism and $$ to turn all that into sophisticated products and tools. That is called fundamental research, basic research, being developed into marketibal products. The goal of academic research is not to develop marketable products, it is to further knowledge. The Bayh-Dole Act briged that basic research to the marketplace and last year alone, "academia" made $4 billion from license fees it recieved from those crooks that stole their technology and passed it off as their own after faking an $800 million investment.  The tens of thousands of industry scientists that spend decades developing drugs based on technology licensed from academia should be insulted by a book claiming they had no role in developing the product. I know I am, and I was in academia once.  Lots of things in his book are just plain wrong. To many to list. No need to, because his fundamental thesis is wrong to. I don't question his telling of all the history though, just his conclusions from it.  Lets take the $800 million. He tells us it costs only $100 million and not $800 million to develop a drug. Well, that is not quite what that number means. The $800 million is the cost for the one drug that made it to market, and the 50 that failed in research. That is called an absorbed cost. You see, the vast majority of drugs that are developed never see the pharmacist's shelf. I worked on one such drug that was abandoned after my company spent over $50 million developing it. Now if you are a stockholder, you think you might want a return on your investment. That one successful drug is it.   If we follow Mr. Goozner to the end of his diatribe, we would find that he literally expects the entire drug industry to be a non-profit industry. Well then, since Amazon.com was created from technology that came from academia, it should declare non-profit status and give away all its profits.  What could have been a strong calling to task on the pharmaceutical industry turned out to be nothing more than the fringe, almost socialist, views of an anticapitalist.  Finally, for an economist I was amazed that he managed to oversimplify how the pharmaecutical industry makes development decisions with all his "me too" drug conclusions. If I have to explain that one I am afraid I am going to have to hop on my pro Posner/Pareto/Coase pedistle and preach, which I don't want to do. That takes me back to my first statements. This author is bias against patents, capitalism, and a little uninformed about science (when he tried to be one, he made it obvious why he is not one). But I did like the walk through history, enough to ignore the misleading filters through which me wanted us to view that history. I gave him an extra star for that one. If you are a social engineer or igorant, you might like this book. If you are at all informed, it will leave you like a parody, amused and nothing more. 
 Not very good print quality, not very reader friendly 
 I saw this book in the book store the other night and almost bought it.  Norman Jewison was on the TCM documentary of Steve McQueen, seemed like a nice guy with some fascinating stories, and I thought it would be interesting to read about his career and all the celebrities he has worked with.  I thumbed through the book, reading bits and pieces.  On the back cover was a praising review from Gore Vidal - Strike 1.  Below that was a praising review from Cher - Strike 2.  Inside was a picture of Jewison with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - Strike 3.  Not to mention the book states John Wayne supposedly called Jewison a "pinko Canadian."  Also not to mention a few other things I found offensive.  I put the book back on the shelf, kept looking and wound up buying "Capote," about the life of Truman Capote.  He was a Southerner, a writer, hob-nobbed with the rich and famous, and on the back book cover it said he had a feud with Gore Vidal.  Home run. 
 the author lives in a dream world and is not in touch with the business work environment of today.  Her advice is old-fashioned and out-of-date.  Many better textbooks on Ethics available 
   I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns,  historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price.  Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity.  This book was fluffy & dull 
 This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all 
 This book is published by the organization which also produces the NA Bird field guide considered "best" by most avid birders, the National Geographic Field Guide (Geo guide for short).  However it is absolutely NOTHING like said field guide!  It is very small (6 inches by 4 inches) and consists entirely of full page color photographs on the left page, and brief descriptive text with a Texas-only range map on the right page.  At the bottom of the text page are even more brief notes, usually about another similar bird, and often accompanied by a tiny painting of that bird (which appears to be taken directly from the Geo Guide).  The photographs are quite good, and really are the only saving grace of the entire book.  They appear to be chosen for their artistic value more so than to illustrate field marks, however.  The selection of species is extremely superficial - for example, the only species of oriole shown is Bullock's Oriole, despite the fact that in west Texas Scott's Oriole is routinely found, and for birders in the lower Rio Grande valley the target species is likely to be Altamira Oriole (not pictured), or, if coverage was as exceptional as I had hoped an NGS bird publication would be, even Audubon's or Black-vented Oriole - and one also wonders why Orchard Oriole, found throughout the state, is left out!  The book description here on Amazon is "generous" in its pronouncements.  The "guidance on where to look for key birds" consists of a one-page, incredibly simplistic commentary on birding in Texas ("The Texas coast is well-known as a place for migrant birds to rest and feed on their way northward."  "Other regions of the state include the High Plains where Lesser Prairie-Chickens still strut . . .")  Turn the page and the most specific location data provided is a map of the entire state with numerous parks and refuges depicted.  But it is left entirely up to you to figure out how to navigate to Anahuac NWR to look for those migrants (where's High Island?), and, since Lesser Prairie-Chicken isn't even included in the main text, how are you supposed to know that Muleshoe NWR might be a place to try to see them?  My greatest hope for this book was that it would give additional insight into the Texas specialities of ABA area birding, but even here it is basically incomplete.  Plain Chachalaca, Least Grebe, White-tailed Hawk, Crested Caracara, Common Paraque, Buff-bellied Hummingbird, Ringed Kingfisher, Great Kiskadee, Black-capped Vireo, Green Jay, Colima and Golden-cheeked Warbler, and Olive Sparrow are all here, but missing are a few regular species which make Texas birding so unique, such as Groove-billed Ani and White-collared Seedeater.  Since only in south Texas can a Muscovy Duck be counted (as opposed to being labelled an escapee from you local park's pond), why not show a wild Muscovy instead of another photo of a wild Mallard?  And what about every birder's favorite dump denizen, the Tamaulipas Crow?  Overall this book is not recommended, at any level of birding, for any use other than its collection of photographs.  For a beginner in the field (or even in the backyard) it doesn't provide the necessary comparison images to differentiate even the most obvious field marks so as to allow identification.  For the intermediate birder trying to locate target species in Texas, the guidance (or essential lack thereof) to places where the birds can be found is woeful.  And for advanced birders - well, they really don't need something this small in size or detail.  Be aware that there are several other titles in this series, for other states, and I suspect that this review's basic criticisms hold for all of them.  As for me, I'll hold on until November when the Fifth Edition of the REAL Geo Guide comes out 
 I read this book and it is pretty darned strict.  I think eliminating foods is all well and good, but I would rather see a book on raw foods that gives me more options, not fewer.  It's a complicated and heavy read too.  Yes, I want to know more about raw foods, but I want to know about them in layman's terms, not from the voice of one doctor speaking to another. I found the language intimidating and the recipes challenging.  Simply put, I didn't like this book.  
 I think there is probably a chance that this is the most poorly written textbook I've ever encountered.  I was going to hold off giving it a bad review until I got through the class, but at this rate I'm not even totally sure I will. I've just re-read the difference between nominal and effective interest for (no hyperbole) the 10th time, and I'm no closer to understanding it. Bad examples, useless derivations, poor explaining. I only wish I could give it a zero 
 I have the same issues everyone else is having...except that ours seems to work pretty well outside (as long as you stay relatively close to the car).  However, as soon as I step inside our house, nothing.  Not sure if it is just a bunch of interference from satellite receivers, etc.  But we will be taking this back 
 Dow Jones is still going through its major corrections after the roaring 80s and then the 90s. We are experiencing the same cylical phase that happened in the 70s - when war, energy crises, international market expansions, and demographic changes were gradually driving the economy to a malaise.  The main difference is that the country was in little debt 30 years ago. We are now owing other countries trillions of dollars, and the trade deficit will continue to soar. The economy may sink as a result, but it has nothing to do with bubble bursting. That was already done in the stock market years ago. Should the economy finally collapse, it will have to do with our structural economic problems.   Most probably prefer a soft-landing rather than a hard collapse. It will take some sacrifice and some political leadership to achieve a peaceful and endurable transition. It will be about our committment to paying down the debt, ending our oil dependence, and educating the workforce to take on the jobs of the new century that are not to be "outsourced" to other places.   As this review is being written, the alleged "greater bubble" has yet to be materialized. However, stocks will NOT emerge into a greater bubble unless the American people can become optimistic about the economy again. Dent has been wrong in his past predictions, so please do not take this book too seriously either 
 This Video is VERY misleading !! I was hoping to have some fun and impress my husband with some new moves, what I got was a Cheesy Video showing me how to walk "sexy" per say and had a cheesy Porn Scene at the end! My husband watched it later on and Laughed his ass off ! If you a tomboy trying to be FeminineONLY THEN would I reccomend it for you. 
 Having been an avid and exclusive user of the VideoHound Golden Movie Retriever (GMR) since 1996, I had high expectations of this DVD review guide sporting the VideoHound moniker. Unfortunately, many of the qualities I'd come to appreciate in the venerable Hound are largely lacking in this DVD guide - most notably, a sense of objectivity... First, it should be pointed out that each entry in this guide is comprised of two reviews: a review of the movie and a review of technical qualities of the DVD. As far as the technical DVD reviews are concerned, the editor(s) confesses in the one of the introductory chapters: "It would be wonderful if all of us - reviewers and readers - could have state-of-the-art 'reference' systems... But that's not the case, and so we don't presume to make definitive judgements."  The problem is, one *must* have reference quality equipment to properly review DVDs.  Otherwise, why bother going to the trouble of "reviewing" the technical aspects of each disc if the unknown quality of the reviewer's equipment is going to cast a questionable shadow on each review?  That said, one good thing I can say about the technical aspects of the reviews in this guide is that each review list all of the special features of each disc, as well as the aspect ratio, the packaging format (i.e., snap case, keep case, jewel case etc.), the list price and so on.  Most useful were the reviewers' comments on the cast/crew commentary tracks included on many DVDs, which seemed to be less biased than the reviewers' comments on the movies themselves.   As for bias, the actual movie reviews presented in this DVD Guide were what was most disappointing to me.  One of the advantages of the classic VideoHound GMR is that there are many contributors, a practice which seems to engender balanced, fair reviews.  Although this guide also features contributions from several reviewers (the vast majority, however, being handled by editor Mayo and chief contributor Jim Olenski), I noticed a very odd and disconcerting practice that was employed numerous times: that of taking a film review from the classic VideoHound GMR and changing a couple of words here and there to support a newly altered rating (changing the 'spin' if you will); or else, incredibly, changing the rating without changing a word of the review.  In a few cases, the movie was completely re-reviewed, and a different "verdict" passed on its merits, which would be fine except that we now have two inconsistent reviews of the same movie, both of which are apparently advocated by The Hound.  Also, when an oddball euro-cult flick such as 'Lisa and the Devil' (originally dismissed with a "woof" by the GMR, which was perhaps a bit extreme) is suddenly bestowed a "four-bone" rating (a Masterpiece!) by the reviewer; or conversely, a moderately successful, more well-received movie such as 'Mystery Men' is given a "woof" (the actual VideoHound GMR gives it a more fair rating of 2-1/2 bones) - one tends to become wary of excessive bias in the reviewer.  It goes beyond one person's opinion of this or that movie: a reviewer should try to put aside their likes and dislikes and concentrate on the movie's objective merits and demerits.  Having used this VideoHound DVD guide now for about eight months, this annoying tendency towards subjective bias is something that is seen to come through in the reviews all too frequently.  So my advice is: For good and fair movie reviews, buy the latest VideoHound Golden Movie Retriever instead.  For good technical DVD reviews, try the Widescreen Review 
 I really wanted to read this book.  I've read a lot about the Nazi persecution of Jews, as well as their persecution of Russians, Slavs, homosexuals, anarchists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and so on.  But I hadn't read much about their persecution of the Roma, or Gypsies, and I wanted to learn about it. But the book is extraordinarily dry.  The author did not bring the events to life at all. It's pretty hard to make a subject as inherently dramatic as the systematic persecution of an entire people not very interesting, but the author succeeded.  What's worse, really, was that as other reviewers suggested, there was a powerful theme of underplaying the importance of what happened to the Roma. I was very disturbed by this. I give the book two stars instead of one because I did learn a few things. But I will be looking for another book on the subject, because I didn't learn enough 
 I've been to Germany several times.....Frankfurt, Koln, the Mosel and Rhine wine tours, etc.  Here are my reviews of the best guides to meet your exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the public transportation system.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide   
 This is a compendium of several articles. Haught makes the same argument over and over again - that God loves the world so much that he is willing to leave it alone to determine it's own destiny. He offers little in the way of evidence of this assertion. It's an interesting idea, but it doesn't need an entire book - the first one or two chapters make the point 
 OK, this is where I got off the SY bandwagon once and for all. Jet Set Etc. was bad enough, but this was the pits, and I wasn't going to sit around pretending that these languid, aimless ditties had any worth (of course with the usual caveat - The Diamond Sea is amazing). This was a once great and powerful band whose creative faculties had utterly dried up, and this is from a huge erstwhile fan. So I just tuned SY out of my life for over a decade, til a friend recently lent me Sonic Nurse and I found they had inexplicably found a new lease on creative life. Anyway, the 2 stars are for Diamond Sea, the rest of the album is sonic (and lyric) garbage 
 Jane Smiley's _A_Thousand_Acres_ had a great deal of potential.  It had a powerful plot (King Lear) that has been little-adapted in modern times.  Smiley chose an interesting and rich setting in her modern day heartland farm.  However, the actual execution of the book leaves much to be desired.  First and foremost, Smiley writes exactly like a writer who has just completed a college writing program.  She uses smart and subtle humor (one may say wit), metaphors and similes.  The problem is that one is conscious at each and every juncture that she is using a simile, a metaphor, or a quip.  While more seasoned writers might have woven beauty into readable text or else have chosen to complexify and engage a reader, instead she chose a middleground that is neither challenging nor readable.  The reader constantly is forced to swallow some rather ridiculous metaphors, all the while conscious that they are swallowing a textbook, but ridiculous, metaphor.  And while the plot taken from Shakespeare had a lot of potential, it was handled quite inexpertly.  Yes, Smiley chose the intelligent path and abandoned Lear about 3/4 of the way through (so that everyone doesn't die).  However, once again, she writes in a way that makes every reader -conscious- that she is adapting Shakespeare, and at times the plot seems ridiculous in its current setting.  Yes, she sheds new light (the protagonist is the Goneril-character, who was a Shakespearean antagonist) in a very intriguing way.  Yes, she invents new excuses for her behavior (former child abuse)... however, had she not tried so hard to make the reader conscious that she was adapting Shakespeare, these plausable interpretations might not have seemed -in-plausable.  All in all, a book with many potent seeds that were not sown to anything near their full value 
 Wild at Heart can captivate your interest and suck you in to believing it's all good.Problem with this book is that it is not sound when it comes to true untwisted scripture.I first loved this book and it began to change me until I researched further only to discover that The Bible has been used incorrectly.If you don't believe me,just punch in Wild at Heart on any search engine and read the complications with these writings.If you are a believer you will see in a very short time what I mean. If you're not a believer I suggest you purchase a Bible instead.With much love to all.......................... 
 This movie is not worth Sam Elliot.  I was very dissapointed, I will most likely thow it away 
 David Thomson thinks he's some kind of superior being and criticizes in a pompous and condescendent manner everything Welles ever did. He's one of those people who think that Welles never achieved anything after Kane. He wonders if he was even really responsible for Kane? He states that Welles did not write any of the script (false), that Greg Toland was director of photography while Robert Wise was responsible for the editing. SO what did Welles do? He directed! Apparently, that's not enough to make Kane his movie, his masterpiece, among others. Well if movies were only based on photography, scripting and editing, then why would directors be needed?  Thomson insults Welles in every paragraph; he hammers him over and over, relentlessly. He focuses on the less successful aspects of his life and exaggerates them. He ridicules him, makes fun of his weight, says he's egotistical, a liar, a misogynist, an unfaithful friend, a machiavellic mischievous man who uses people, cheats on his wives, dates married women, eats like a pig and stuffs his face with anything he could find (he talks a lot about that), a pretend genius or would be genius who thinks he's the victim of evil Hollywood moguls. What other bad things could be said about Welles? Basically, any insult or evil thought you would ever have towards your worse enemy would not match up to the way Thomson writes about Welles.  Welles is not the only target of the author's wrath towards famous people. Any dead actor that was a friend or acquaintance of welles is also treated unkindly, as for the ones who are still alive, Thomson refrains himself from making a judgement. What a coward! Dead celebrities are such easy targets to criticism aren't they?  When Thompson runs out of evil things to say, he talks about his childhood and when he went to see The Third Man with his grand mother who for some reason has a claw instead of a hand. Oh poor little David, he could not hold his grandma's hand, only a claw! Tear. Who cares! Also, he has the annoying habit of interrupting every other chapter with imaginary conversations between the writer (?) and the publisher (?). It's never quite clear and really pointless. It's a way for him to put himself in value and shows how he can also criticize his own work. What a decent man!...  I was not expecting a hagiography, I know Welles was not godlike. Thomson explains at the end of the book that he does not mean to put Welles down, but only attempts to humanize him. Well there's a difference between humanizing someone and destroying the truth. Also, a biography should include anecdotes, facts, it should be detailed and accurate. Thompson writes some kind of very superficial, selective, inaccurate story, with imaginary dialogues about what people could have said to welles or thought of him. You can't assume things in a biography.  The author is too involved with his own thoughts instead of sticking to the facts in an objective manner. If you want to learn about Welles, read "Road to Xanadu' by Simon Callow, which focuses on Welles life up to Kane. Or "This is Orson Welles" which is a series of Welles interviews conducted by Peter Bogdanovich in which Welles tells the story of his life. Sure he had a tendency of lying about his past, but only because he was a story teller. Story Tellers always add a little to the truth. Thomson has no such skill.  Unfortunately I can't give 0 star to this book, or I would. It's really just food for the shredder 
 Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest 
 Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.    There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters.  It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!  I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.  Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!   
 The book is pretty much useless. The one thing that will come in handy is its dictionary. The questions are badly written and confusing, and the answers don't actually vary very much. The reasons given for the answers tend to be little more than saying "The author implies -repeats multiple choice answer- 
 Ignore all the glowing comments on this product. Resolution is TERRIBLE, even for fully cropped mug-shots of just a person's face.   You have to hold the device at arms length just to make out some images since they are so blurry any closer. Save your money on this one. 
 If this would have been the first James Patterson book I ever read, it would have been the last (and that would have been a shame!).  Too gory (without any real purpose), too many characters (who are very one-dimensional) and too much stuff going.  That being said, I did quit reading this book about 1/3 of the way through (which I hardly ever do).  Maybe I missed out on the good stuff in the last part of the book, but I really doubt it 
 I had high expectations for this book, based on the reviews posted here with comparisons to Bill Bryson and all. I found this book uninteresting and often offensive. He offers nothing new in terms of trail description and his writing style is nowhere nearly as interesting, informative or entertaining as Bill Bryson's. To me, he comes off as a sexist and racist man who is mostly interested in the next town, barely mentioning the actual trail and descriptions of the landscape, etc. His descriptions of Mexicans and Native Americans are based on racist sterotypes and ignorance. Granted he bases these on his only previous exposure being Hollywood portrayals, but he does nothing to correct his fears that the Mexicans will steal from him or that the "Injuns" will scalp him. Just because the author is from New Zealand does nothing to make this book worthwile. I was very disappointed 
 This might be of some to someone who could not print out the manual that ships with Reason.  Otherwise, it simply is a lazy rewording of the manual - a functional description of the components.    Whereas the manual might say, "such-and-such a knob does so-and-so" this book says "such-and-such a knob does so-and-so, turn the knob and play a note, see what happens."  Well duh.  Part of what makes it come to over 300 pages is its wide margins printed over with a gratuitous graphic of a level indicator.  Reminds me of a kid's book report they try to fluff out to make  extra pages.  You'd do much better to play around with the turorials that ship with Reason, and visit Propellerhead's website for some real tips, tricks and insights into stuff not covered in this quick and dirty little pamphlet 
 This DVD doesn't look professional. Cheap camera work combined with ok (at best) music make this DVD a mildly entertaining 40 minutes. The sequencing is choppy, cutting between different scenes, it really doesn't flow well. There are maybe a total of 10 girls dancing in this DVD. I bought it so I could play it in the background on mute when I spin at parties, but this is not the right DVD for that. The music in this DVD doesn't match the dancing, and since the girls aren't professionals, the dancing itself is pretty awful. If you want to see girls dancing to techno music, go to a club. The last ten minutes of the DVD are a lame interview with some unknown DJ, which is totally pointless 
 I think Jenny McCarthy is pretty funny, but not in this DOA stinker. Poorly shot and with a terrible script, this movie is the equivalent to watching paint dry...BORING. I hope she fares better in Scary Movie 3 
 Like the other Hayduke books, whatever relevance this one may have had has long since passed. Pretty much outdated and useless, and not even very entertaining.  Go with Victor Santoro instead 
 This is not worth your buy, the book can be read in an hour and is filled with common sense advice, showering, brushing your teeth, etc.  This was written for a 13 year old who has absolutely no idea what a woman is or wants.  Half the book is about having confidence, again simple common sense that your mother taught you when you were 5.  The book was written by a woman who simply does not have the capacity to convey advice to men, it is like her way of telling the male species how stupid we are.  My opinion is that the author compiled many different aspects on other confidence building, body language, dating books and put her spin on it.  I suggest tyring to find other books that have more meaningful, real life advice.  She actually suggests meeting women at Renaissance fairs, NOW, cooking equipment classes, etc. USELESS ADVICE 
 I LIKE BUDDY GUY ALOT AND HAVE MOST OF HIS CD'S, HOWEVER THIS DVD IS NOT THAT GREAT. I GUESS I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE HIS CONCERT FROM THE CD BY THE SAME NAME, WHICH IS GREAT. THIS DVD IS SHOT AT VERY CLOSE ANGLES AND ALMOST IN BLACK AND WHITE. THE CONCERT FOOTAGE IS DONE IN A KIND OF A DRAB BROWN COLOR. THIS IS A BIOGRAPHY DVD ALSO. LITTLE INTERVIEWS MIXED IN WITH THE SHOW.ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN BUDDY KNOWS HOW INTENSE HE CAN BE IN CONCERT AND THATS PART OF HIS CHARM, BUT THIS DVD LEAVES ME FLAT. THERE ARE OTHER SHOWS ON EBAY THAT ARE MUCH BETTER SUCH AS THE NORTH SEA JAZZ FESTIVAL SHOW IN 2002. IF YOU WANT SOME REAL BUDDY GUY, THATS THE ONE........... 
 I thought I would like this book as the subject manner and descriptions sounded interesting. But the author would start a train of thought and then abort the idea and move on to another - I seemed like I was listening to an crudely abridged version! I will NOT read another of hers if this is the way she writes. I was very disappointed...this book could have been great!!!! The characters I felt were shallow and so much more could have been done to deepen their personalities, thoughts and feelings 
 Michael Chiarello needs to stick with the non-Italian dishes because dude doesn't have a clue how to pronounce Italian nor, to compund the problem, does he know the reason why he cooks the Italian dishes.  And I "love" the "Italian" music that accompanies the shows where he cooks those dishes.  Nothing like hearing hillbilly country blues while he's cooking up an Albanian-Italian dish.  Makes a lovely mix.  And he, like many of the Food Network's chefs, cook stuff that requires tons of ingredients (that can get expensive) and time to prepare.  American dishes are more for him 
 This is a truly fictional account of the final days of Vincent van Gogh.  Anyone who understands the life of this artist will be taken aback by this film's completely insensitive portrayal of Vincent's relationship with his brother.  In one scene, Theo actually discount's Vincent's entire output, wishing he had painted more like the impressionists!  This film would have you believe that despite a forbidden, sexual relationship with his physician's daughter (who is about half his age), Vincent is driven to commit suicide.  First of all, there is no evidence that such a relationship ever occured.  Further, the film offers no insite into the true character of the artist and the real reasons that he took his own life.  I gave it one star because I can't go any lower... for an accurate account of this artist's life, see "Vincent & Theo" or "Lust for Life.&quot 
 I would rather eat grass!  These may be healthy, but we tried 5 recipes and found all 5 unedibly bad 
 This writers work was recommended to me and I felt that it was worth a try. The story line is slow to develop and a poor job exists in truly learning the characters in this book. Although the action does pick up as the story goes on, it takes about 250 pages for the action to get going. The story is quite predictable and is far from what I was hoping for. It almost seems as if the writer was fighting to meet a deadline and this work was shoddily put together. Attention to detail and errors in the proofreading of this work added to my unhappiness. 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 If it bleeds it leads. Sensationalism at its worst. Painful novel to read but forced myself to finish. Yuck??? Have heritage and have studied history of this era and region from the best of Harvard professors. This fiction was filled with far too much blood and sex. Not a good read, actually somewhat insulting for those with Irish background 
 This book is one of the worst books that i have ever bought . The writers are just based on emotion and not to scientific facts . They hate any food that is not green .They use some  psuedoscientific facts though for example , If u put a child in a cage whith a rabit and an apple the child will eat the apple and play whith the rabit thats why we must not eat meal !!! there is an  abundance of such '' scientific facts''.  Stay away from this book , it can only make your health worst  
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 A music on this disc is very good and can be a good introduction into Tatum's world. It's also not too complicated. Bad news is quite poor sound quality. Good for listenign through PC speakers but decent Hi-Fi system reveals all recording's shortcomings and make it quite disapointing 
 This dictionary definitely has some interesting words and the appropriate definitions, but it is not very comprehensive.  I purchased the book last week and several words I tried to look up were not listed: ecumenical, for starters.  Please excuse my spelling of ecumenical, because I don't have a real dictionary with me at the moment. Purchase this book only if you intend to keep it right next to a real dictionary, and in that case you might not need it 
 The author credits himself with writing a type of history which is complete and fully in the context of broader events.  But somehow he manages to miss some of the larger ramifications of the very events he is describing in this book.  He seems to be attempting to minimize the impact that these three infamous trials had on Jewish and wider history before and after the turn of the last century.  Most historians realize that the Dreyfus Affair had such profound effect on European Jewry that it served as an impetus for the ongoing Zionist migration to Palestine at the time.  Theodore Herzl was a journalist at the time who was so profoundly affected by what he saw in France during the Dreyfus Affair that he founded the first Zionist congress in 1897 in Basle, Switzerland as a direct result.  This, of course, has had significant impact on world history.  But Lindemann pretends that life went on its merry way for Jews in Europe afterwards.   And in the United States, he has a similar blind spot regarding the historic significance of the lynching of Leo Frank.  After bending over backwards to suggest that the prosecutor, the press, and even the enraged mobs were not driven by anti-Semitism in this case, he tops it off by missing the largest single lesson of the entire ugly affair.  In the immediate aftermath of the brutal lynching of Leo Frank, the Ku Klux Klan was revived and vastly outgrew its former incarnation.  Many well-known leading citizens of Georgia (including then current, former and future members of the Georgia House of Representatives) formed what they called the Knights of Mary Phagan (named after the girl who's murder was falsely attributed to Leo Frank).  The lynching party grew from this group, many of whom gathered at night several weeks later on top of Stone Mountain (east of Atlanta) to burn a huge cross and form the KKK.  But none of this is mentioned by Lindemann 
 The lack of practical, usable information in this book was unbelievable.  Maybe if you have never, ever, in any way considered these issues it would be helpful, but I doubt it, as there was nothing that delved beyond surface, common sense information.  The gross overgenderalizations about race and culture were offesive and shocking coming from people in the field.  The only thing I took from the book was a heightened awareness of the judgemental biases of people -- even those claiming to be fighting against those things 
 Very bad English and extremely difficult to read. I will definitely not recommend this book to anyone unless he is an expert in data mining 
 I was looking for a more detail book and I found this one too basic 
 Even though I am compulsive about finishing books that I start, I just cannot bring myself to waste more time with this one. It is boring.  The material is not new. The ideas are not new.  This is just a rehash of material that is regularly published in The Nation, and has been debated for decades.  I do give Ms Pollitt credit for being a very talented and brave writer. However, I did not look to this book for style, this is a book on politics, and in that area, it is very weak.  Ms Pollitt is one of the bright lights of contemporary feminism, which shows what a weak state the political field is in. Feminism is floundering, the left is lost, the right has gone off the deep end, the center is adrift. American politics is a mess.  When one of our most talented political writers can only bore me, what can we look forward to this political season 
 The sheets have huge lint balls, which get on your floor, your clothes, your hair, your comforter, your blanket.  I don't recommend these sheets 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused.  I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain.  If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe 
 i loved all of the previous books by Alexander McCall Smith and looked forward to each new one, although the frequency of publications does make one question if his writing has turned into a pure money producing scheme. However this novel failed to develop Isabel in the manner that I have always viewed her character and has became superficial. To end as this does seems extrordinarily superficial to meet a mass market view of society, and reminds me of the second movie in the 'Back to the Future.' This novel destroyed Isabel for me. mar 
 This book is terrible! It's horribly written complete with dialogue that is as trite and flat as a bad 80s sitcom. It starts off with a passive unemployed stay-at-home father whose wife appears to be having an affair. It then develops into a highly boring and implausible tale about nanoparticles trying to take over the world, or trying to eat us all, or something. I don't think Crichton ever really got that far in his thinking.  ***possible spoilers below***  This book is very important in pinpointing a few useful life-rules:  1. Anyone who looks like they have lost weight/bulked up is dangerous! (Those nanoarticles are deadly, but boy, do they help ones' body image)  2. There is nothing much out-of-the-ordinary about a mother slapping her baby when she gets home from work. In fact, if anything, you should always be the one to apologise...it doesn't matter for what.  3. If you're trying to get a few crazy nanoparticles to rule the world, make sure the FIRST thing you do is call in the main guy who is able to destroy your whole big plan.  4. Nanoparticles bear a striking resemblance to sandflies. They say they're thousands of times small than a hairs' breadth...but don't worry, when they buzz around you'll see them no problems. They also have the ability to bite.  The whole things is so badly written from start to finish that it wasn't even a  guilty pleasure! The characters are all so one dimensional and the whole thing towards the end (Ricky and Julia being coated in nanoparticles?!?!) is just ridiculous.   Plot holes are abound, for example, why on earth would this thing need to be transferred via saliva/kissing? They're nanoparticles! If they can buzz around and take differennt shapes etc, then surely they can fly into whatever or wherever they wish.  The BIGGEST surprise for me was that in the end, our 'hero' manages to save the world from these critters with explosions, a trusty sidekick, and some kind of virus that the plant has been haroburing all along.  If someone can give me back my 2 days that I spent reading this rubbish I'd be eternally grateful. I'd ask for my money back, but the book was given to me for free by a bookstore. Obviously they knew its true worth 
 I recently found this two-pack in a bargain bin for five bucks, Being a Lucy fan I snatched it up and brought it home. Well all I can say is that I'm glad I only paid five bucks for it. On the up side the shows are highly entertaining and they highlight an era in television that rarely receives it's due, But on the down side the tranfer looks like it's been pooped on and at times all you see is a white screen with an outline of Lucy. But the shows almost make this DVD a good value, bottom line! BUY IT FOR FIVE BUCKS. Any higher it's a bad value 
 (Note: I wasn't going to post this review on Amazon, but as the publishers have picked two words out of it and used them out of context on the page, then I think I should put the record straight and post the whole thing.)  I run a number of web sites and I've been running Google Analytics on many of them for several months, but ever since I started using it, I've been sure that I could probably get a lot more useful information out of Analytics than I am currently doing. Currently I'm only looking at a handful of the huge number of available reports. So when I was offered the chance to review this book, I hoped that it would really open my eyes to the power of Google Analytics.  Reading the book has largely met those goals for me. I now make far better use of Google Analytics. But getting that information out of the book hasn't been a particulary enjoyable experience.  I'm pretty sure that part (if not most) of the problem is that I'm not in the audience that the authors had in mind when they were writing the book. I'm an IT consultant who has been building web sites for over ten years. I've been monitoring web site usage using systems like Webaliser and AWStats for a lot of that time and I've picked up quite a bit of knowledge of web site measurement technology over the years. So when the "Who Should Read This Book" section of the introduction says "Do you have a web site or blog that you'd like to track? Can you control the HTML on that site? If that's you, you've got the right book" then I think that I'm the kind of person that the book is written for. Unfortunately, what that section doesn't say is that if you already have reasonable level of knowledge about how this all works, then you're probably going to find a lot of the book a bit tedious and pointless. The book seems to actually be aimed that the large number of people who have a web site but aren't web industry professionals. I can't complain about that really. That's obviously a much larger market, but I wish that the book's marketing made that a bit clearer. A lot of this books reads like Google Analytics for Dummies and that's not the book that I was looking for.  That's not, of course, to say that it's a bad book. Just that I think its marketing might be mistargetted.  Having mentally reclassified the book as a "for dummies" book I had to try hard to recalibrate my expectations of the book and ignore the classic "for dummies" style of the book. For example the whole book is written in a very "folksy" voice that I find irritating and completely inappropriate for technical books.  The authors also seem to be under the impression that some of the material that they cover will be too hard for their readers. For example, when talking about regular expressions they say "Regex can be pretty confusing, even for experienced users". As a trainer and writer, I know that if you tell someone that a concept is really confusing then you can almost guarantee that they will be confused by it. As a teacher it's your job to make sure that the concepts aren't confusing. Regular expressions are complex, but they follow regular rules (the clue there is in the name) and you really shouldn't need to teach them using an attitude which discourages people from trying to understand them.  But actually I suspect that the reason the authors take this approach with regular expressions is that they themselves don't really understand them. I think this because their examples are all a bit confused and not very well explained at all. For example they have an example which uses the regular expression 690=([^&]*) and nowhere do they take the time to explain what it means or how it works. After reading this section, I'd be surprised if anyone comes out with a clearer understanding of regular expressions than when they went in.  However, the section on regular expressions is by far the most technical part of the book and in the rest of it the authors are on far more solid ground. When explaining all of the reports that you can get from Google Analytics then their explanations get much clearer. This is where the value of the book is to be found. Google Analytics has dozens of reports and the authors clearly understand the data that they all contain and what each report can be used to show about your web site visitors. I found a number of useful reports that I hadn't previously been using and that are now giving me far better information about who is visiting my sites.  In summary, the descriptions of the Google Analytics reports are very useful if you can ignore the over-familiar language, but the sections that contain deep techical detail are patchy at best 
 The Langoliers is my A #1 all-time favorite movie.  But I ordered the DVD from Amazon and it would not play in my DVD player.  I researched the internet and found it was in an old format that is now unreadable by newer DVD players (don't ask me, I am not terribly literate on DVD formats).  To watch the movie, I had to save it to my computer's hard disk in 5 gi-normous chunks (it would not save the whole thing to one file folder), then download freeware that I used to convert the format to something that Windows Media Player Classic (yes, folks, that's right - tho original WMP from the Windows 95 operating system - had to download that, too).  ONe chunk could not be read from the DVD because a sector was bad (?) so I am missing the whole first part of the movie.  I then converted each file folder using the freeware, and to watch the movie,  I have to sit at my computer and watch it on WMP Classic from 1995, and click on the next file folder as the previous one finishes.  Took me hours of research, but I love the movie so much, I had to get it to work.    [... 
 In all honesty, this book was severely lacking in just about every area. It wasn't horrible. I didn't mind reading it, but there were just so many problems with the story as a whole, so many poorly developed aspects that kept it from being a truly good read. The story was very two-dimensional, lacking development and depth. It was just very superficial.  The characters have very little depth or exploration. The authors give you some basic history, but fail to really explore them. They mention things but then never really tell you about them. An example is Maggie's pregnancy. You know that the antagonist got her pregnant at a young age, and you're told that there was some sort of cover-up to get her out of town so no one would know. But they never give you any details. You have no idea exactly how old she was, and you're not told anything at all about this cover-up. Where did she go? What did she do? How did she handle it all? Why did she make up a husband? It would have been nice to have these details and it would have given another dimension to Maggie's character.  Zack's was in a similar state. You know his FBI step-father was killed by the antagonist but you learn little else, other than that Zack was greatly affected by the slaying. I wanted to know how old Zack was when his mother married his step-father, what their relationship was like, how he dealt with the man's death, etc. Again, knowing all this would have made the character more full-bodied. The authors just failed to give these characters any depth at all.  The romance between them was poorly developed as well. It seemed extremely forced, with very little emotion involved. It was like, hey, let's kiss; hey, let's have sex; hey, I think I might have feelings for you. I wasn't feeling the chemistry between them at all. I had a really hard time believing that these two characters were in love.  There were also some minor areas where issues bothered me. One was that Zack, as an FBI Agent, was allowed to participate in the case at all. He was personally connected (his father being killed by the antagonist 14 years earlier). I had a hard time buying that that would be allowed. Also, Destiny, who had roles in the other books, is done a serious injustice in this book. She's paired off and engaged with hardly a whisper. A little more on that would have been nice.  As for the good points...well, I enjoyed the cameos of Max and Jamie. Fleas the hound dog and Butterbean the goat were great. And the actual plot wasn't too bad. But none of that could overcome the holes in the book. I was rather disappointed overall once I finished.  Rating: 2 / 5 
 I am a great fan of Bernstein's "Candide".  I saw the 1974 production twice.   My wife saw it three times -- she took a friend once.     This DVD should have been an excellent performance.  Lupone and Chenowith after all, but the DVD copy I have has such abysmal sound that any enjoyment of the performance is near impossible.   Muddy, echoing, not really even a clear visual image.  I assumed it was a really bad recording job.   Is it just that I have a bad DVD copy? 
 Nero 7 wants to prevent you from generating ISO files and instead wants you to use its NRG CD backup file system. Then it doesn't want you to burn WAV onto CD but forces you to invest in MP3 encryption so that you can burn MP3 to CD. The software is full of these horrible twists that Nero has gone from the best burning rom to the worst burning rom by simply making it harder for you to do what you want. I rolled back to Nero 5.5 and had a fully functional and top of the line burning rom again 
 This book is targeted for beginning writers.  I have no idea how this book would be valuable to any beginning writer in that it is convoluted, wordy and rambling. His method for writing is described in the reviews below, so I won't repeat it here.  In the book, the method's description is full of seemingly unending twists and derivations (though they really don't say all that much) and he annoyingly and frequently quotes from his own journal. How a beginning writer would learn the process of this book and then go out and find ten other people who have done the same is beyond me. I would not read this book to learn how to write.  Instead read literature, write, and repeat 
 McCarthy is a very talented writer (read Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing, using many archaic words. Suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot. Despite the novel's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character. Certain chapters are interesting (the workhouse chapter especially), but these passages are few and far between. Also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way. McCarthy writes about nature beautifully, but after finishing this book, one is left unfulfilled. 
 As far as I can tell this thing doesn't work at all.  I have now tried it on 3 cds and it did not repair any of them.  I should have just replaced the cds 
 If you have a "day job" and own a few rental properties on the side, this book won't help much.  It's got some cool ideas for someone that wants to add some pizzazz (read "work") to thier property management practices.  I have to admit that I even used one or two ideas.  But this isn't a reasonable "how to" for someone who actually needs help learning how to rent properties.  I didn't use any of the forms, either.  They are too casual and sometimes flippant - I wanted a more professional and legally sound basis to work from.  For a comprhensive guide get "Landlording: A Handy Manual for Scrupulous Landlords and Landladies Who Do It Themselves."  And don't forget Nolo's "Every Landlord's Tax Deduction Guide."  This topic needs it's own book.  Even "Landlording" won't educate you on this topic adequately 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible however he does bring up some good points. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book entiteled "The Great Divorce" 
 I have one and Panasonic doesn't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests. The proprietary video format requires special handling in your PC and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips.  Are they abandoning this product? Look on the Panasonic website and see for yourself 
 Don't waste your money. Get the following movies...  Le Mans: About as real as racing can get. Just wait until the end of the first lap and you hear the roar of the Porsche engine. It gives me chills just thinking of it.  Grand Prix: Great cinematography! The melodramatic story can be a bit much, but the movie in widescreen is spectacular.  Days of Thunder: Just plain fun. Not that accurate, but a fun movie...and it's a Bruckheimer!  Don't even bother with Driven unless you can borrow it from a friend. Don't pay to watch this piece of unrealistic, hollywood shlock 
 Well, after listening to this CD I'm beginning to understand why Ringo didn't do too much singing while in The Beatles. He probably wasn't allowed to. The songs "Only You" and especially the late Johnny Burnette's "You're Sixteen" are practically raped on this album. Yes, I know, there are much worse voices around, but that alone doesn't make this CD any better 
 I wanted to like this book...  I enjoyed the first two in the series.  But this one left me a bit dry...  Babylon Rising: The Europa Conspiracy by Tim Lahaye and Bob Phillips.  This continues the story of Michael Murphy, a college professor teaching biblical archaeology.  He is now heading off to Iraq to follow a tip on the location of "The Handwriting on the Wall" from the days of Daniel.  He's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area, and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life.  Talon and the mysterious Seven are trying to eliminate him, and there are a few attempts on his life.  Mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on New York designed to throw America into an economic and national panic, as well as to prompt the UN to move their headquarters to the ancient city of Babylon.  Murphy, for someone who's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean, finds himself in the middle of all this...  As I said, I really wanted to like this book.  The Murphy character is likeable, and I enjoyed the action.  But the plotline was spotty and over the top.  Murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him (highly unlikely).  Everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time (over the top).  The story attempted to be both a Christian End Times novel and a terrorist suspense novel, and they didn't do either one especially well.  Murphy's growing infatuation with Isis was rather repetitive with the "she's so beautiful" and "could she be interested in me" interludes.  And finally, none of the plotlines wrapped up.  You got to the end and thought "so?"  Fine if you're ready to read the next installment, but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one...  Part of me wants to be nice, give the book the benefit of the doubt, and rate it a "3".  But the authors are better than this, and I've come to expect more from someone who's been doing this for a long time...  If you're committed to the series, you'll want/have/need to read it, but just don't come in with your expectations very high.. 
 More than one month after I innitially order, it is still weeks away from being delivered 
 Ordered October 9th.... Not delivered as of November 22nd. Now due to arrive mid December. Yuck 
 I have all three of the "Verve Remixed" CDs. This one is the worst. On this CD, I just cannot see the point of mangling these old recordings. I found no compelling rhythms at all.   By contrast, the #2 and #3 CDs in the series are great. I find this puzzling. Usually, sequels suck. In this case, the musicheads at Verve seem to have improved their game with practice. I respect them for that. Now I'll just start up Remixed #3 and bliss out for a while 
 Hopefully THIS isnt the image the world has of the AMERICAN. If it is.....no wonder we are such a despised bunch.   First off....this book pretty much said nothing new. It is a "either you toe the line with US...or you are a traitor and giving comfort to the enemy" bunch of re-hash.Standard, neo-con, defense of each and everything that this administration does type thing.  The thing I found funny....I guess...is that he says WHY WE FIGHT? Is is just me....or do all the bloated, fat, wannabe heroes who write this stuff pretty much fit the DRAFT DODGER....sit in the back and start the fight and not get involved mold!!!???  Itis ALSO hard to read about how we should do all this from this virtuous air sack while he preaches to the masses and then does exactaly as he pleases at the gambling table. Oh....but then we are told by HIM AND HIS PACK OF TALK SHOW LEACHES that it was OKAY for Doctor Bennett to doit cause he could...ugh...AFFORD THE LOSS!!! YIKES!!  Moral clarity....better get some DOCTOR BENNETT before you start pointing your fat fingers at everyone else!!!  I guess this would be good reading to someone who wants their already neo-conistic views confirmed...the same reason to listen to his ridiculous radio show. But the hypocrisy of this arrogant, do-gooder was almost too muc 
 I haven't read the two preceding books, but I sincerely hope that they are better than this one.  I'd like to think that a federal judge would have better sense than to keep an obviously raped 6 year old in the woods for a week "until she learns to trust him."  Meanwhile, her poor mother is searching town after town with no indication from him that she is even alive.  I feel very doubtful that said mother, on discovery of the man with her suddenly verbal child, would say to him, "I would have done the same thing in your shoes."  Even knowing that he wasn't the original kidnapper, I'm pretty sure I would have sent my daughter out of the room and shot him anyway.    No thanks to Ramsey, the kid hasn't died from internal injuries, and now that the mother (who is far, far more clever than every incompetent law enforcement agent in Colorado) followed the only solid lead that the police "blew off" and is back with her daughter, I think I'll leave them to go on the run without me.    Lazy writing -- it wouldn't have been hard to create a situation where Ramsey and the child together made sense.  
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 I returned it even though i had to pay to ship it back! Should not be a kids book, it had very few pictures and no color 
 Talk to the Polish and South Koreans, and ask them why they do more with less.   
 This was a much anticipated and very disappointing reading experience.  Ms. Forrest is an excellent writer, but this latest effort should not be listed as a lesbian novel, nor as a romance.  It reminds you of the 50's when a lesbian character is thrown in for attention.  If Daughters of an Amber Moon had been the first book, then Daughters of a Corral Dawn would never have had to be written as a sequel because no one would have cared about the other group of women.  This is mainstream writing making money posing as lesbian literature.  The fact that Ms. Forrest is a lesbian does not make her writing lesbian.  In the last few years, her books have become more and more mainstream sanitized.  Daughters of an Amber Moon proves once again that you cannot buy a book just by the author's name.  Characters are not well developed and no one the reader identifies with or gets close to emotionally.  Writing skill is good.  Subject and characterization is not.  I would not buy this book again, nor recommend it to my friends 
 Four years ago, I received this movie for Christmas.  Boy, was it a piece of crap!  It should've never been made.  The acting was terrible, it didn't have a good plot, and all of FAS's characters made absolutely no sense.  I threw it away because it was so bad. I don't regret trashing it because I'm 100% happier without it. Do NOT buy this movie unless you enjoy watching garbage. 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it

 If you are looking for a directory on CHRISTIAN spiritual retreats, then this book is for you. However, for those of us looking for a spiritual, yet non-religious experience, then this guide is not helpful. I was hoping this directory would help me find spiritual retreats embracing a variety of practices. It did not. Otherwise, it is a well-organized and thorough guide within its narrow focus 
 This was a waste of money.  My 5 year old loves taking photos.  She uses my digital camera  sometimes.    I  thought this would be a great gift for  her.  She could  see the photos on the back of the camera like  mom's.  This was not the case.   The LCD does not  project the images  and it is so small  you  can not read what mode you are in. If the batteries run  out, it erases the  photos. I think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly.  My daughter  was frustrated  quickly and  it has laid  in  the  drawer  for 3  months. If your child  likes to take  photos, I would invest in something  else 
 its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it 
 i doubt that i could persuade any die hard grateful dead folks from shying away from this. the grateful dead were fine in their day, but don't tread on deep waters of the NC/TN/KY/VA/WV bluegrass. excellent movement of the fingers on this CD and if yer into fast fingers, well fine. but like fast movement of the fingers does not make the blues; fast movement of the fingers does not make bluegrass.  it comes with the territority. a valiant effort. but stick with the potheads who don't know music from whatever 
 It is an aptly named book.  Why?  Because this book is FULL of disinformation.  Just another book written to perpetuate the lie of why we "need" the so-called "war on terrah".  All of the "myths" this author outlines have already been debunked over and over again by better researchers via other publications.  
 When making the purchase I was unaware that there was both a double disc and a single disc version of this product. When i researched it I only found the double version. I thought I was buying the double version and did not see any disclaimer that there are different versions and I needed to check which one I was buying. Had I known this was a single disc version, knowing only about a double disc version being available I would not have made the purchase. 
 Not the highpoint of her career, I'll say that. Yeah, the title track is a great bit of 90's Hi-NRG techno. Catchy stuff. If you just want that track, buy the single and see if you can get some remixes of it too.  Sadly, this thing is an album. Albums are inhently prolonged affairs, and here, Madonna seems bent on putting forward a set of songs that ramble on for far longer than they should. I mean, none of these 13 songs are shorter than 4:10!!! Most tracks begin as a snoozy collage of synthesized dwaddling, with the eventual trip-hop beat sneaking up and suffocating the track with monotony. Some might have some uber-fast dancefloor throbbing, but a bout of four on the floor repetition does nothing to decrease monotony.  If you ever needed an excuse to hate 90s techno, well, listen to this album. Then again, listening to any 90s techno will automatically induce human beings to vomit in order to purge their systems of that foul guff. Ugh...  Highlights include: "Ray of Light," and that's about it.  I'd suggest that you buy The Immaculate Collection and then pick few select singles ("Ray of Light," "Music," "Beautiful Stranger" and "Hung Up"). That's pretty much all the Madonna you'll ever need 
 My last one (same model) was good.  This one, the auto shut-off just buzzes and doesn't shut off 
 This movie is silly at best, racist at worse. I can't believe Ice Cube actually wrote the script for this mess. My opinion of Ice Cube has been drastically lowered. It's the old black jiving and shucking all over again. This movie has all the classic black stereotypes. It even has a scene where Smokey gets so high that he ends up in the chicken coop thinking he's a chicken. Remember the old minstrel shows?: "nobody in here but us chickens." There's no  plot to speak of, just a bunch of insults, getting high, stealing money, potty jokes, black people knocking each other upside the head. Some character get punched out, and Smokey (Chris Tucker) goes over and yells in his face, "Dude, you been knocked out!" That's a typical "joke" from this movie. How about a dogcatcher getting bit on his behind by a dog? Hilarious---Not. After watching this dvd with my family, we tried to think of one funny or worthwhile scene, and we couldn't think of a single one. 
 I very rarely write reviews, but I looked over a  few on here and realized I had to chime in.  I believe Faith Hill is one of the most brilliant country artists to come down the bin.  Take Me As I Am, It Matters To Me, and Faith were masterpieces of interpretation, vocal prowess, fully developed albums.  Faith Hill as an artist however began to go astray on Breathe.  Breathe was an album of phenomonal moments spread out over mediocrity.  With Cry, Faith Hill's search for new audience completely led her astray.  "Cry" and "When The Lights Go Down" are the only even vaguely listenable tracks.  The rest of the album is a mish-mash of pop-wanna-be songs that don't even begin to live up to the potential of the artists.  Sometimes fans become blinded by loyalty to an artists, and I don't believe it is fair to people to buy an album based on those opinions 
 Not so bad, not so good... it has good topics, but there are not implementation of how to build it, the small number of sample have some unique (rare) style... if you intent to write your first compiler this is  NOT your book, if you already made one and pass for some frustating issues  then this is your book.. 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 I read a book by Donald Goines about a raped woman and the whole time I was reading it, I was thinking "Why in the world would someone write a book like this?" As much as I love all of Flake's other books, that's the exact same thing I was thinking about this book. The book started off very interesting about how one brother deals with another brother's death, and it reminded me of a cousin which gave me good and bad memories. But then the book launched off into this twisted relationship between the living brother and his father. This book deeply disturbed me during the camping "results" and after that it just became so off-the-wall.  I started questioning my donations to homeless people and who really needs it.  I can't say the book was bad...it just wasn't for me...and definitely an extreme difference from the other books that I've read by Flake 
 Ann, an aspiring writer, knew of Lucy, an aspiring poet, when the two of them were students at the same college.  Actually, everyone knew of Lucy.  She was the one who'd had cancer as a child and whose chemotherapy treatments had left her with a severely disfigured face that continued to need surgery after surgery until the end of her life.  Lucy was mistreated by her peers when she was a child, but it seemed that for the rest of her life everyone was trying to make up for that cruelty.  She was cheered for and spoken to warmly wherever she went, despite the fact that she seemed to have few redeeming qualities that would make her so popular.  Even Ann admits that she followed the gossip about Lucy's medical condition and she felt close to her even when Lucy had no idea who Ann was.  Ann couldn't be more delighted when Lucy decides to move in with her after college.  She continues to be thrilled and grateful for the rest of Lucy's life, as Lucy drifts through existence, needing constant reassurance that people loved her, that she was beautiful and talented.  She also needs money, and someone to clean her apartment, and someone to do her bidding after her surgeries.  That person is always Ann, who seems to simply accept that this is the way their relationship should be.  I was confused.  How could an intelligent, educated person allow herself to be treated so poorly?  What was Ann getting out of this relationship that I couldn't see?  Or was it simply that she befriended someone prone to depression and suicide attempts, so she felt she couldn't drop Lucy without putting her life in danger?  Ann is a much better friend than I could ever imagine being; I would have stopped speaking to Lucy after about the fiftieth page 
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 If you have had the opportunity to see the (out-of-print) show catalogue (Giorgio Morandi: [catalogue of] an exhibition of paintings, water-colours, drawings and etchings) this skimpy overview will not only disappoint, it also will not whet your appetite for more of this insightful artist's  oeuvre 
 I was disappointed with this book.  The events described are an almost an hour by hour passage of time, during the short lives of these two antagonists. We really don't care what Clyde did at 2am on the morning of the 15th of the month if it really has nothing to do with the outcome of the event!  It seems as if this author wrote these pages directly from a courtroom transcript or a witness' testimony. Furthermore, there are entirely too few pictures (we want to see more of Bonnie & Clyde - duh!!).  Pass on this book and buy one of the others out there.  
 I bought this mouse a couple months ago to use with my MacBook Pro.  I loved it, until a couple days ago when it decided to stop working.  It's not connecting to the USB adapter any more.  I changed the battery and tried the Connect button, and nothing.  Sad, isn't it 
 The first dishwasher that I received from Etronics was dented, dirty and looked as though it had been used.  I complained, they picked it up, and one month later I got the replacement.  It wasn't in much better shape, but I kept it anyway because I was tired of waiting. The dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes, and although it cleans well, the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made, and it leaks even with teflon tape.  I would not make this purchase again 
 Although this text does cover a wide range of safety topics, it is somewhat dated and contains a farly large number of typos.  Therefore, the reader has to be careful.  The book needs to be updated and the typographical errors corrected.  If that were to be done, it would definitely be a five star book 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 The Old Wine Shades, Martha Grimes' twentieth Richard Jury mystery, begins with a dog walking into a bar.  From there, the story takes a meandering journey to a vacant house and the dog's owner who disappeared there.  Much like the standard shaggy dog story, Martha Grimes' twentieth Jury mystery takes its time making a point. 	Grimes fans recognize her use of pub names in her Jury titles.  In this case, "Shades" is a London establishment with a snooty bartender/sommelier cursed to serve a customer base, Jury included, that is largely ignorant of the finer distinctions of wine appreciation.  At this particular pub, Jury finds himself becoming enthralled with a tale, told by a mysterious gentleman of considerable means, of a vanishing woman, her son and her dog.  The wife and son have never been seen since their visit to an advertised piece of real estate.  The husband/father is apparently confined to a mental institution for the enormously privileged, distraught over his loss.  But lo and behold, while the wife and child never came back, the dog did! 	New readers will wonder why the dog returned.  Was it to be bored to tears by this meandering tale?  Loyal Grimes readers are likely to cut the author more bait, but only before wondering the same thing.  Alas, Grimes, who has the ability to captivate and convince, has stretched a bit too far with this effort.  Grimes might have developed a reputation as a thinking person's author has abused her position in The Old Wine Shades.  This is a poor representative of Grimes' work, and new readers will be better advised to latch on to an earlier Jury novel, any earlier Jury novel.  Regular Grimes readers can only hope that her next one will be a better endeavor.   
 I bought these shoes about 2 months ago and they are already ruined.  The leather is so thin that it has separated and is peeling.  
 The author could have done much more with her subject.  Many anecdotes in the book suggest Sandy Weill is a complex character.  For example, Weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal, yet ridiculously lavish executive.  At one point he won't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work, yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet.  Unfortunately she never addresses the question: how can Weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly?  Other, similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest Weill is a very complex individual.  But the author never treats him as such.    In the last analysis her book is a patchwork of news articles that discuss different chapter's of Weill's life and career.  To sew the articles together into a coherent story, the author suggests that Weill's stunning ascent is driven by his simple desire to be accepted by the WASPy Wall Street powerbrokers who won't let a Jew join their club.  Perhaps that is the overarching goal that has driven Weill for the past 40 years.  But it raises interesting questions that the author doesn't address.    I'm a Jew in finance and Jews have been very well-represented on Wall Street for some time now.  Weill is presented as having been driven to create Citigroup by his notion that he was still being excluded from the WASPy Wall Street club.  But by this point we're into the nineties and any exclusive WASPy club had long since been abolished.  So all of a sudden Weill comes off as pathologically insecure, which is intriguing.  But the author doesn't elaborate.  This is a good book if you want a run down of Sandy Weill's career.  No other author has compiled so much information about the man in one place.  But all that information confirms that Weill himself is a very complex man; to do her complex subject justice, the author would have had to do much more with this book 
 I have to agree with Stephen Haines. This guy drags in everything but the kitchen sink. He makes Boehme a Gnostic, the troubadors, the Knights Templar, William Blake, the Masons, Jung, and finally, any physicist worth his salt.  I mean, some of these folks might not have been orthodox in their Christian practice, but being heterodox does not make one a Gnostic.  How did he forget Meister Eckhart, and Sabbatai Tzvi? If he has Boehme as a Gnostic, then these also are Gnostic.   He never distinguishes between Gnosticism as a group of sects, and gnostic practice, which pervades Kabbalah, Sufism,etc.   This is just not a good book 
 I recently found these authors and have been devouring the Pendergast series with great enthusiasm. Having worked my way down the list to "Brimstone", I opened the book with great excitement. Unfortunately I closed it with great disappointment. The book started off with a bang, fizzled in the next 400 pages, and a good 1/3 of the book could have been left out entirely. Much as I want to give the book three stars, the ridiculous plot just won't let me. The plot started off interesting and spooky but when the motive for the murder was introduced, it was so mundane and silly, I put down the book and laughed out loud. After that I had to force myself to finish it.   I didn't like Hayward in "Reliquary" because she came across as a tired, clichï¿½d feminist (act tough and swear like a man to get accepted).  The subplot involving her and the equally tired, clichï¿½d "Christian nut cases" was so dull it should be bottled and sold as Valium. Eventually I skipped over all those chapters as they lent nothing to the main plot. The abrupt, exceedingly premature office sex scene between Hayward and D'Agosta was unbelievable from numerous viewpoints: 1) no sexual tension had been allowed to build between them. The sex simply came out of nowhere and was thrown into our faces with all the subtlety of a gorilla at the dinner table. 2) the idea that a "by the book" female police captain would risk her career by having sex in her own office while on duty with a co-worker just didn't ring true. Oddly, the relationship was then dropped until the final pages.   Agent Pendergast, whom I have adored previously, was the only thing that kept me reading, and even he was allowed to go so far off the deep end (he deduces the entire murder motive from a piece of horsehair - Come on!) that he lost the endearing characteristics present in the earlier books. Even the attempt to introduce Viola as a love interest for Pendergast failed (they looked into each others eyes for a breathless minute - PUH-lease!). Please guys, no more romance. Stick with what you do best and leave the romance to Danielle Steele. 
 Or maybe use it as a paperweight; gosh knows it's heavy enough.  Let's see...if you can't figure out who the bad guy is by about page 50, you're either asleep or you just ain't tryin'.  Hackneyed characters, implausible situations, convoluted plotting for its own sake...but hey, a couple interesting tidbits about Hess's aborted mission to England (or was ALL THAT made up, too?).  The big plus for this book is that you can easily read it on an airplane flight.  Any airplane flight.  Like Chicago to Tokyo.  Or maybe Chicago to Peoria.  Just depends on how many pages you skip while reading.  As I got "into" the story, I started skipping 3, then 5, then 8-10 pages at a time.  Sometimes whole chapters.  Never lost the "plot" (what?), never missed the "sex scenes" (huh?), might have missed some ridiculous blood and guts (plenty more ahead on page "X+5" - not to worry).  Can't wait to skim his other books 
 Evidently a lot of people love this man's writing, but they must be loving something else because this book is about worthless. Forgetting the issue of PC-ness he broaches by having an Arab-American as the terrorist of the title, it's just not very likely. Other reviewers have said that he chose this character as his instrument to reflect on the state of America today, and his origin serves solely as a plot device to cause his disaffection with this society. But I think if that's the case, it's a weak and unnecessary device, given that there are plenty of Americans who are as disaffected and more prone to violence than some half-Arab New Jersey teenager. As a matter of fact, although it's a topic not often discussed, the main terrorist threat in America comes from white Christian extremists. These people aren't even theoretical; they've actually been responsible for real terrorist acts all over the United States.  Be that as it may, Updike is one of the least astute character writers I've ever read. If anyone reading this doesn't like that assessment, I suggest picking up Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment" or "The Brothers Karamazov". Now that's some character writing. I just felt like he endlessly described people's outsides and never touched their insides. It's a book, which means that you have the ability to show the reader the thoughts and feelings of a person, but not to adequately depict their facial expressions or colorations (in other words, it's not a picture). And yet he rarely took the opportunity to get inside anyone's mind, even the main character Ahmad's. And what little internal narration he did give Ahmad was pretty much the same thing over and over again. As for the other characters, he may have intended them to be mockeries of real people instead of making them real people, but if he was doing that I certainly didn't pick up any hints of satire to clue me in. The whole book was dead serious, and dead boring.  I tend to lump all books into two main categories: they're either about the characters or the plot. Given that the characters were such a failing in this book, you might be tempted to think the plot redeems it in some way. You would be wrong. The story itself advances slowly with about three-fourths of the book being wasted in unnecessary build-up (which would be fine if there were decent characters, but as it is...). The climax is so anti-climactic it actually made me sleepy. There's absolutely no payoff in the end.  If you're a fan of this guy, perhaps this book could work for you. For me, it was an unfortunate reading choice and a complete waste of time. If you want to read books about domestic terrorists that are just as implausible but a lot more exciting, pick up Tom Clancy 
 This is a sickingly incipid "book," a complete waste of time. This so called writer should not be allowed in print 
 My daughter saved up birthday & holiday money to buy this doll.  She has it "programmed", but hates it because it does not recognize her voice responses.  She tries to play with the doll, but always winds up in tears of frustration and anger.  She now uses Allyen's accessories to play with her more simple dolls.  Yes, simple dolls.  You know - the dolls that allow little girls to use their imagination during play.  I just can't believe this doll cost SO much and is SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY! 
 I found this book very hard to get into. Our grade 12 english teacher picked it for a comprehensive novel study.I think that things just moved way too slow for my liking. It had a good story line but because of the nature it was writen in I would not recomend it to anyone 
 This book is cliche ridden vitriolic feminist rant against the physics community. The author thinks that male physicists interested in the Theory Of Everything need "a major personality realignment". She thinks that universal suffrage is one of the primary forces that has shaped modern Western culture along with physics and parliamentary democracy. To support this she unconvincingly attempts to upgrade the role of women in physics with long boring sections about obscure women physicists. Did you know that Barbara McClintock's notions have revolutionized genetics or that Lovelock's Gaia theory was enabled by his female colleague? There are various insinuations of God, religion, and Christianity in various arguments through the book. The conclusion is that if we re-populate the physics community with a different type of male and a lot more women, including some with the force of religion in their lives then physics can focus on "different goals and dreams", not particles and forces. Bah! Don't waste your time and money on this one. 
 Its some weird crap sent to Canada. Go to their website and its totally differen 
 The book delivers what it promises the so-called CEO perspective. Its just a chatty overview, useless for actual risk management at any level. Maybe they should use it as an introductory MBA book for those who have no exposure to finance at all 
 Yeesh. The title of this book, Suburban Sweatshops:  The Fight for Immigrant Rights would lead you to believe that it's an expansive look at a *nationwide* problem - would it not?. Well, it's actually a very cerebral discussion of the author's own (commendable) work setting up the Workplace Project, a small resource center for immigrant workers in Long Island. Still sounds interesting, doesn't it? Well, it might have been, in other hands, but we actually learn remarkably little about the workers.  We meet a few individuals - or rather, "case histories" - but the author is a lawyer, not a writer, so while we're told a lot about the workers' grievances, we learn very little about their actual lives (and nothing whatever about the other side of the story, if any). Mostly, it's a lot of chin-rubbing about legal and organizational strategies for increasing the influence of Long Island wage-earners. Perhaps the publisher thought that giving the book this broad title (it ought to have been called something like, "MY Fight for Immigrant Rights") would increase sales. It worked on me - 20 bucks later I have a book I don't want and my only way of defending myself is . . . this indignant review. The reason it gets two stars instead of one is because Gordon has done so much good work for our country and, in particular, the most exploited and neglected among us. I would much rather have contributed the 20 bucks directly to her organization. 
 This is one of the worst films ever made! And I mean it!! One of the worst scripts I have ever come across. The acting is hammy and the direction is very weak! There was no reason for this movie to exist! "Turbulence" was a good movie and they should of stopped at that but two sequels! No way! If you like the 1st mabye try "Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying" but stay away of the 3rd. This is one terrible movie! Believe ME! 
 After reading a review here mentioning subscription issues I went directly to American Artists web site and ordered a subscription. That was November 23, 2005 and now Feb. 10, 2006 still no magazine. When I finally complained I got a request to send my credit info again to vnu@espcomp.com. Can't say from looking at that address that I have confidence I was communicating with American Artist or a magazine publisher. Would you send your credit info...I think not. I'd say don't blame Amazon as a previous reviewer did.  Hey, the magazine is good if you can get a subscription 
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 Not as good as second rate tv movie ... way out of date. Skip this one. There must be better.Wait for the one buy her sister,"Trainwreck" 
 I have recently purchased the tape series of Love 101 much to my disappointment.  If you are looking for a little reinforcement and a different perspective on how to accomplish self-esteem, these are not the  tapes for you.  However, if you enjoy listening to introductions to clips  of nostalgic music and comedy routines then you might want to give this a  try.  I found that the subject matter had little to do with self-esteem  directly but more to do with announcing the next "ditty" ranging  from Mae West to Al Jolson and Groucho Marx.  I doubt if most of these  routines and songs have seen the light of day since the big band era. These  tapes were more of a trip down memory lane than a "boost" in  one's self-esteem 
 I have worked in the 'Osteoarchaeology' field for nearly 10 years and I when I bought this book I did not expect to be reading a novel type book. Books like this are dramatised on frequently watched cable/network tv - I live in Ireland! I have used other books by the author and found them invaluable, but not this.....an ok read but dreadful reference material 
 I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day.  We have a recycle area in our apartment building, but it is usually used for things that are not brand new!  These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on.  I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again, unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before 
 This is a hit or miss product. I ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating (burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes), the product did work for a while. My extremely dry, curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working. I would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut, jojoba, almond, avocado before shampooing or after. I adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier. If you do want to try the product, ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them. 
 Be warned, the publishers made the awful decision to take the 2005 Almanac to press too soon.  It does NOT include the results of the 2004 presidential elections.  Big mistake.  For sports fans (and New Englanders), this edition also does NOT include the 2004 World Series results.  What a poor decision by the editors.  Why not hold the book for another month and put in the elections?? 
 The Long Long Trailer is a good movie but Too Many Girls is when Lucy and Desi were very young and thin but the movie Too Many Girls is awful and Forever Darling is awful 
 This is another product placement by Gary Null Inc. repackaged with a new title and cover. Gary Null is a God and knows everything about everything. Gary knows what you should eat and how you should think. Ignore the fact that he owns a private multi-million dollar media, supplement and gadget company that sells nearly all what he advises to consume. No conflict there at all? Gary is a brilliant marketer and here are his tactics:  1)Create documenteries, radio shows, movies, lectures, books that strike fear into your audience so that they are in a constant buying mode. Make them fear to breath the air, to  drink the water and make them fear their enviornment in total. Claim that you are the authority and others are cranks aimed at harming you and your audience. Evoke fear, conspiracy theories at every turn, and taint the competition (mainstream medicine) as immoral, money grubbing and intentionally harm promoting.   2)Provide a catalog of products to calm the fear evoked. Have them buy costly air filtration and water systems, expensive magnetic products, costly vitamins and supplements, and provide media so that you can reinforce the fear and buying behaviour. Advocate a costly and restrictive diet that few could follow for long so that they will fall back on your food replacement and food concentrates as well as vitamins. Above all promise you base that if they follow your advice and buy the products  they will look young and live forever. Promise the suckers that they will avoid sickness and will be the chosen ones.   3) Claim you make little or no money and that the profits go into making public service movies even though you charge to view them, and even though the profit markup on vits and supplements run in the hundreds percent range. Claim that you have advanced degrees and are a scienctific authourity even though you went to nontraditional schools and could not get a degree from a legit University. Should anyone challenge you claim that they are part of a conspiracy to silence you even though that if false- it increases the your profile among followers.   
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 I'll try to start with something positive: the cover is pretty.  Beyond that, I'm not going to put more time into my review than the author spent "writing" this book which means I've got 5 minutes or less. This is a collection of newspaper columns. If the author wrote 10 columns on the same topic and included them all in the book, he didn't even bother to edit out the redundancies. Columns that span 20 pages in the book could have been reduced to 4 by eliminating the 80% of each column that he spent repeating the previous day's columns. Couple that with columns that spend 10-20 pages arguing against a particular injustice, only to see in a 1 paragraph note at the end that the injustice was indeed righted, or that the column is 5 years out of date and no longer relevant with events that have transpired since, and one gets the sense of a writer with little respect for his readers and their time. Done. In under 5 minutes. 
 This seemed very pretentious, with an unnecessary amount of literary references.  It was convoluted and felt like wading through mud - difficult to get through 
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 I am a fan of blues and roots music who bought this album based on its interesting set list of classic songs and its rave reviews from various sources. Unfortunately, I found the album way overproduced. There is too much bland orchestra, chorus, and strings that smother the life of the songs. A few good tracks are exceptions: "Fess Up" is an affectionate solo piano tribute to Professor Longhair, "Cabbage Head" has amusing lyrics and a smaller combo that doesn't overload the sound, and "I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You" has some good moments where you hear the interplay of individual instruments. But overall I would recommend this album only if you love Dr. John's voice and want to hear what he does with these classic songs. If you love his piano, go for the solo "Dr. John Plays Mac Rebannack." If you want to hear New Orleans blues played with great piano, vocals, and backup band, buy "Crawfish Fiesta" by Professor Longhair. To my ears, "Goin' Back to New Orleans" is overrated 
 This is one of the worst texts I've ever read!  The author writes as though the reader totally understands every complex example presented.  This is amazing because some parts are very simple and easy to understand.  The calculations and formulas are almost to impossible to comprehend.  Don't waste your time with this book!  There are better, more comprehesive communication networks books out there.  This text is by NO means "A First Course" 
 The following is my opinion: As a physician myself about to start my own private practice, I came across this book and thought "well, it's only ~$13 and I'm sure it is worth at least that much and I'm sure I'll get at least one or two pointers." I was wrong on all accounts. Let me save you some time by giving you the answers he offers to his two questions: 1)why most medical practices don't work, 2)what to do about it. Answers: 1)because physicians don't have a system,  2)create a system. Makes promises and keep them.  That's it. If at this point you are saying to yourself "that's it? You have to be kidding!", then you know exactly how I felt after reading the book. Through most of the book, he would bring up provacative questions and I kept thinking to myself "here it comes, I wonder what his answer/solution to that question is,I can't wait, that is such a good questions." And time after time and for the entire book, it left me disappointed. He provided no real answers, or answers that only a child or a moderately mentally challenged adult may take as plausible.  It is like being promised a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and then finding it filled with a pot of manure. He often makes very strange comments. The one that comes to mind right now is: doctors don't understand time with a capital T, they understand time with a lower case t. When I came across comments like this, I was waiting for something profound to be said, which of course left me disappointed and wondering "what the heck was he talking about?" He would tell stories of how patients hated waiting for long periods and that resulted in patients feeling frustrated. Duh! He speaks as if doctors like their patients to be irritated and as if doctors enjoy running late for appointments. His solution to this problem? Stop it, stop being late! and promise patients you will see them on time and keep your promise. You heard me, that is his real solution! He tells a story of a doctor he knows who adopted this philosophy and promised his patients that they will be seen on time or else they do not pay!! I would love to meet this doctor, wouldn't you? He didn't comment on this particular doctor any further. Why do I get the feeling there was much more to that story that is being left out? What made me realize he has no idea about the medical profession is the following: he feels and states that physicians can predict how much time is needed with each patient and that if doctors apply this, that they would never run late. He states that physician don't have to estimate how much time each patient needs but that they can exactly predict how much time is needed. Too bad he didn't share his secret of how to do that, I would paid him big bucks to learn that secret. He would give extremely unpractical advice for physician how to make sure patients do not become dissatified, for example: to always listen to the patient and never interrupt them and always let them say what they need to say. For those of you who are doctors, I'm sure you got a big chuckle reading that just as I did when I read it in his book. In summary, his books has many intriquing questions, no answers which are practical. In my opinion, when I read the negative evaluations of this book on amazon, I thought "well, cheap book, sure I'll get something out of it, maybe those negative ratings are exaggerated." In my opinion, book is less than mediocre and the negative ratings are exactly on target. I rec if you have to check out the book, go to the bookstore and skim it for 10minutes, trust me, you won't buy it 
 I just returned to reading anything "Dragonlance" after a long departure and selected this to start.  I'm disappointed to say the least.  I'm only a hundred or so pages into it and hope I can finish.  But, there is nothing happening.  Nothing that makes me want to pick it up.  Not like I remembered from earlier series when I couldn't wait for the next volume.  Here's hoping it gets better 
 Three baby owls awake one night to find their mother gone. Alone in the dark and understandably frightened, the older babies discuss where she may be while the youngest cries, "I want my mommy!"  Mom owl finally appears and assures her babies that she will always come back. Although this book addresses a common concept familiar to toddlers and pre-schoolers-Will Mommy come back if she leaves?-I have to say that it should have remained a picture book. Although the black ink and watercolor crosshatched illustrations on a black background are very realistic, they set an ominous tone that, in tandem with the plot, I am not certain should be introduced to very young children; at least not introduced before bed time.. 
 AFI's debut album is a great deal different from their last few CDs.  There is no traces of Goth or pop punk here, just straight up old school punk with some truly hilarious lyrics.  The problem with this album is it's all the same, there's almost no variation, so it's good when you listen to just a few tracks (all of which are good) but put back to back it's impossible to get through the entire CD without a headache.  The two standout tracks for me are "High School Football Hero" and the Classic "I Want a Mohawk but My Mom Won't Let Me Get One". The music reminds me alot of MxPx's debut CD "Pokinatcha", but the lyrics are alot more similar to the Offspring.  Definitely a good CD if you wanna see where the band started and you're already a fan, but if you're new to AFI and want to backtrack from Sing the Sorrow or Decemberunderground I recomend either Black Sails in the Sunset or the All Hallows EP instead 
 Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama. 
 I have worked in the 'Osteoarchaeology' field for nearly 10 years and I when I bought this book I did not expect to be reading a novel type book.

 I live in the ghetto(because the darkest blacks live there), am insecure about my nappy hair, will not climb the corporate ladder as swiftly as my light skinned peers, when choosing a mate I will desire a light skinned husband so that I can dip into a lighter gene pool, and finally, if I had to adopt a child I would REQUEST a light skinned one quicker than a dark one.  Slave talk, all of it!  I read this book (most of it) with a completely open mind and hoping for a well researched and fair study of black america's color complex. I ended up throwing this book across the room in frustration. This book perpetuates the myth more than black america. As a dark skinned female I felt horrible reading this, mothers don't let your babies read this, it can be SERIOUSLY detremental to ones development. In all honesty I can say with much authority (after all I have been black all of my life) that the very vast majority of black people do NOT think like this. I find it very hard to believe that it's no more than a coincidence that the authors are the two who benefit the most from the "color complex", a light skinned female and a dark male (because according to this book light skinned men lack the all important street credibility and dark skinned women are bitter and unattractive).  This is a disgraceful portrayal of what could have been a pivotal cultural study. Shame on them for perpetuating the myth 
 Hannity is always on top of his game by winning the conservative lie fest on Fox news time after time. Move over OReilly 
 These ear plugs I feel were misrepresented in that the picture shows one type (the kind I wanted), but what was sent to me was not at all what was in the picture.  I did return them without any difficulty 
 jessica lange won an oscar for this, proof positive that some years are so bereft of strong performances, they HAVE to give it to somebody. apart from that, this is a silly exercise in anti-government paranoia, with a wasted tommy lee jones and not much else. 
 The recent disappearance of Spalding Gray has made me realize what I don't like about this film: its narcissism.  It's Gray's defining characteristic.  After a while, despite Jonathan Demme's fabulous direction (he makes the  best of a limited repertoire) it just gets boring 
 Many telling points, but the book is flawed.  It is very repetitive and judging by the many misrepresentations of Catholicism in it, which the author could easily have checked, I am not sure how accurate the book is on Islam.  I would imagine there is a more focused and objective book on the subject somewhere 
 The material is fine. They cover most of the basics. However, I found the book to be extremely repetitious. They would often say the same thing over and over, page after page. It was comical really. The book could easily have been edited down to half its size.  The construction of the book lacked any organization at all. I got the feeling that the many topics in it were written at different times and slapped together when it was time to put it together for publishing. You could just as easily read it from back to front because there really is no flow to the book.  I also had a problem with this Abraham thing. It was kind of a turnoff really. I understand it's a nice marketing angle, but enough already. I hope no one out there really believes that this info came from some supernatural entity. It's too bad, really; the writers seem knowledgable enough to have written on this subject without the need for a gimmick. 
 Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.    The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer.   	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna.  	 Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one 
 In trying to get it set up, I went through multiple help technicians, most of  whom were difficult to understand   All that was accomplished was to mess up our internet connection, and then was told that my ISP would have to straighten out the problems Belkin created. One technician was honest enough to admit that the install disc was practically worthless.  Otherwise, it was nothing but a headache of waiting on the phone, being cut off, being shuttled around, and getting nothing done.  We did finally have good success, with another product 
 The Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an FM radio, but it has 2 issues.  The Good: The talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on. It is nice to hear when you are rolling along, "9000 steps." The FM radio is very elementary, but functional. There is no dial to tune. You push a button and it rolls to the next station. There is a volume control on the earphones. The pedometer uses AAA batteries that can be purchased anywhere.    The Bad: The pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor. It didn't break, but it was very annoying. Several times it popped off w/o me knowing and I left it in a restaurant or in a friend's car.   The Ugly: If I accidentally bumped the reset button  - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day's count and went back to zero. The pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost. This would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day. Very frustrating.   The clip broke after about 3 months -- so I retired it.   I bought a Omron HJ112 Premium Pedometer and have been very pleased with it. It has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband, the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor. It has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight. It has a clock. It uses a button battery. It does not have a radio and it doesn't talk, but it works and works well.   The Sportline would be good if it had a teather, a clip that didn't break so easily, and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally. 
 Although it looks very nice, this item is a failure. I found it to rust inside after about a month. Once rusted, no matter how you clean it, it will rerust. I have quite a few items from the "Naturewood" collection as it is our pattern and this item is one of the rare bad items 
 Shaonnon Drake is the nom de plume of Heather Graham.  Both are basically in the "bodice ripper" genre I guess. (Graham is the name for hardcovers and Drake for the paperbacks, it would appear).    This book was so bad I almost stopped at the "Prologe" in which the errors were almost laughable.  The author's vision of WW-II combat seems to have come from watching the final battle in the movie Zulu one too many times.  From there I was able to wade as far a a slice of Chapter 2 where a combination of boredom and lack of interest in the plot overwhelmed me.  I'm glad I just checked this out from the library, because I hate to think I would have spent money for it 
 This is a HUGE mistake in buying this issue.  Wait until the reviese edition comes in, there are too many mistakes throughout the book.  Its fustrating not being able to finish most of the excercises because of typos or left out information 
 It has been a while since 1948, when five Arab nations launched an attack on Israel.  The purpose of the attack was not to protect anyone.  It was to obliterate human rights of Jews in the region.  In effect, the Arabs were fighting for pride while the Jews were fighting for their lives.  Not surprisingly, the Jews fought harder.  And the Jews won.    Now some scholars have decided that the time has come to deny all this and rewrite this history, claiming not only that the Jews were arrogant aggressors, but that most Jews conspired to tell the same lies about it.  It certainly serves no purpose to blame the victims of the Arab invasion in such a manner.  If the cause the authors are fighting for loses, what will they have accomplished?  If their cause wins, they will have struck a very counterproductive blow against scholarship, justice, and human rights.  
 Brad Mehldau has great talent I believe, I have listened to him for years and heard him live at the Kennedy Center. I'm a fan, a big fan. Which is why it saddens me to hear another CD like this like his Tokyo CD.  Trying to be positive and balanced: the slower stuff is, as usual, the most involving. "Alfie" "She's leaving Home" and the Nick Drake title track "Day is Done" are clever and listenable, new.  But then, there is the spikey rest.  Like a new soundtrack for a takeoff on the "Beautiful Mind", a movie in which a talented but unstable pianist goes increasingly obsessive and repeats certain note patterns over and over, louder and louder. I'm sorry, that's what most of it sounds like. (Just trying to save your money!). And there is a curious pattern of Mehldau playing passages in a completely different meter with left and right hand. Difficult, yes, Entertaining or musical, no.   Yeah he certainly "constantly gooses the proceedings into new and unexpected territory" as someone else has said, but that new territory is not very listenable. Sort of like a good meal with way too much pepper.   I resold mine after very few listenings. Except for "Anything Goes" Mehldau's better stuff continues to be his earlier recordings where the studio, probably, kept a closer watch and gave him less license to do as he pleases. It made for much more listenable, more emotionally involving music. Buy Art of the Trio 1 & 3 instead 
 When do the black kids take responsibility for their behavior?  How can the school help them to do this?  To be sure, it is shameful for schools to overly punish black youngsters.  At the same time, what does one say to black youngsters who devalue school or use it as an avenue to act out certain stereotypes or cultural dilemmas--when the acting out is self-destructive.  We are caught in a cycle of acting out what Richard Wright called the "Bad N*****" archetype--that is, Bad Thomas, who did not care if he was beaten or lynched, and who remained unbowed before "white" (that is, illegatimate) authority.  His heroism was in remaining unbowed.  The author would have done better by searching for the bilateral influences (cultural, stereotypical, archetypical, and developmental): that is, how being "tough" (read: a "hero" on one side, "bad," "unbowed" on the other) affects school personnel.  Having done that, she could then make recommendations about how to extract ourselves (both children and adults) from this two-way morass of two-way screwy, self-destructive behaviors and reciprocal archetypes, Bad Thomas on one side and Simon Legre on the other 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool. 
 This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months.  About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono.  Had to send it in for repairs.  After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred.  Had to send it for repairs again.  A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease.  In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged.  I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night.  So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely.  When turned on it gives "HDD Error" message .  Resetting does not work.  The computer no longer "sees" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195.  Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit.  I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again 
 Zone 5 is not cold climate gardening! Book is a waste for those who truly live in cold climates 
 It seems clear that much research went into this book, unfortunately with very little visible editing.  There is much tedious repetition of the same point. Extraneous information peeks out at us without elaboration. It is true that New York emerged as the center of American publishing, but why tantalize the reader with this fact by means of a single sentence in the midst of several pages about the garment industry. The treatment of the 1911 Triangle fire is far too minimal, and suggests, erroneously, that this was a solely Jewish experience.  This is most emphatically not the case, either in terms of the victims or the long term political consequences both for Jews and the Democratic party.    
 When yours truly was eleven and in Reading class, "Incident" was required reading.  This had to be the most ridiculous book that I ever had the displeasure of reading. I mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now. Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  What eleven-year-old wants to read about that? So, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you 
 I thought that this book would be about geometry of exotic (but real)  places in outer space (such as a black hole, for example).  Instead, it  turned out to be a lethally boring book, full of math problems, that was  LESS interesting than my geometry book in high school 
 There is no question that the audio part of this device works well; but what use is it if the wire would not last more than 3 months.  The wire protection is of rubber material which softens after several days. After 2 moinths you will see ruptures in some parts of the wire 
 but this one isnt all that bad, it has rarities in it. "emotion" by samantha sang is one of them. She vanished after that effort (which was produced by the BeeGees) but what a hit it was. I guess if you are going to soak the money into the complete series, you need this volume 
 I was disappointed in this book/tape.  I thought it would give me some real insights into life and spirituality, as alot of good books have.  But this was just nausiatingly gay, hopelessly drippy, and not insightful at all.  I didn't want anyone to read poetry to me or ask me to notice what a peach looks like.  I wanted something different.  I give it two stars because I know other people liked it, and others may find it nice to read/listen to 
 This book is comparable to the dozens of others written by extremists on both ends of the political spectrum.  Do these guys really think America is this stupid 
 I have four Panasonic phones with this dreadful battery.  Everyone has been replaced at least once and two of these have failed again.  But no more!  There is good news and it doesn't require you to build your own battery.  I bought the Energizer replacement P511 battery which is has much better amperage (1200mA vs. the Panasonic's 850mA) and uses better battery technology (NiMH vs. NiCad, and NiCad is notorious for memory effect problems).  I will post a review of the Energizer on its page, but a quick result is that I now have two phones using the Energizer and both work longer on a charge.  And a surprising difference is that the phone seems to work better at longer distances from the base!  Not sure why (perhaps the extra amperage??) but where I always have had some static using the same phone in the same room, I now have clear reception!    I had been considering ditching these phones altogether, but maybe the new Energizer batteries will forestall that expense 
 If you release a second edition you need to support a second edition, that includes the publisher's website and the downloadable scripts that go with the book....this book is okay, but who has time to type in all of the sample scripts to learn. For not including the scripts I give it a 2 
 Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God "out of the box," such as Tiffany Snow's "Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect." Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's "7 Laws" though, and some of his other works 
 This movie must be restored--the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with Bloody Mary's singing Bali Hi. I tried to purchase a completely restored, digitally remastered DVD of this musical and could not find one in 2007.  I returned this DVD to the seller

 You will first encounter one of the biggest lines of BS when you read Elvis Costello's foreword where he describes Mr. Emerick at the end of the second paragraph: "You could not meet a more modest and self-effacing man". If Geoff Emerick truly has such qualities you'll be hard pressed to find it in this book because the journeyman hack he hired in writing this piece of rubbish does too well of a job in presenting him as completely the opposite. Other reviewers have mentioned the constant fawning over Paul McCartney at every opportunity, the absurd trashing of George Harrison and Ringo Starr at every other opportunity, and the insensitive denouncing of John Lennon in between those opportunities. The put-downs he throws towards George Martin are just childish. This is such an annoying book that halfway through, this long-time Beatles aficionado who was greatly looking forward to reading it had to stop. To paraphrase George Harrison, "it's a drag, a well-known drag... 
 I am a huge fan of Ms Morrison. IMO she should have won a Pulitzer for "The Bluest Eye". But I find her increasingly difficult to understand. Beginning with "Beloved", Ms. Morrison novels have taken on a mystical quality that bewilder and confuse me. Often I have to go back and re-read pages to find out which character is speaking or remembering or dreaming or what. I gave up on this one somewhere in the middle. I am now plowing through "Love" in which she uses the same tactic and it's a guessing game. I really wish she would return to her earlier style as exhibited in "The Bluest Eye", "Sula" and "Song of Solomon".  
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 After reading a number a positive reviews on the product, I wanted to try it.  I am glad I just went to my local Whole Foods Supermarket, instead of paying excessive ship/g costs when ordering online.  Basically, I do Not like it...don't like the taste or texture; I am not really bothered by the smell once it is rinsed.    I eat Tofu products regularly and I also eat pasta occasionally and would rather eat my whole wheat pasta 1-2x/mth than eat this tofu-noodle regularly.  However, everyone has different tastes. So if you want to try it, get it from your local grocer (if they carry it), otherwise don't waste your money on ship/g 
 Awful.  If it was possible to get a zero, this book would deserve it...Material might be interesting if it was presented in a "manly" manner, at least readable...It's the same stuff over and over again, as if the author is trying to convince himself...  A book on "Manliness" ought to be manly, straight forward, tell it like it is and move on...readers and critics be damned, take it or leave it...this book is any and everything but that, and this critic chooses to leave it and suggest that you do the same...  The author's points are "manly" in one important aspect (at least to the academic world).  He goes against "political correctness" and takes a stand against what is considered "acceptable thought..." Three cheers for him on this point...but if he really wanted to make his point, he should have written a "book," not a bulky unreadable dissertation...Little wonder that it is #9,151 on the Amazon Best Seller List and, most likely, dropping fast.      Having said all of this, to be fair, I must point out that our men's book club had a most lively discussion about this book.  Only two people had struggled through the book (two out of nine), but the ideas in the book provoked great discussion. Unfortunately not much of the discussion was about what was in the book 
 The book is good in context but I when I got to the center of the book, it split in half.  Now the first half of the book falls out of the binder.  I'm going to have to remove all the pages, punch holes and put them in a binder.  This is a Guide that I will use and reuse frequently.  I'm disappointed that it did not hold up better.  I haven't even finished the class yet and I didn't abuse the book, just opened it to read and highlight certain sections.  Would you consider replacing the book 
 I was confused by the range of reviews for this item, so I went and checked it out at a local bookstore before I ordered.  I'm really glad I did.   This book is clearly drawn by, and for, the people who think Star Wars films are great because they have lots of chases and fight scenes and techo-gadgetry. The woman who comments on what was left out of this "Complete" Guide strikes a note with me.  I'm a guy, but a guy who loves Star Wars for its archaeological richness and mythical roots.  The buildings which really interested me in the movies were the ceremonial ones, not the mechanic's shops.  I can't believe that the Galaxies Opera House was left out completely and that only the hangar of Naboo's royal palace was drawn. That said, I still found things to interest me.  Jabba's palace was well covered, and the illustrators showed a Wookie tree, which didn't really enter the films much at all except as background shots.  The podrace stadium and Geonosis battle arena included areas of sociological quirkiness.  Mostly, though, my eyes glazed at the minute details of hyperdrive cores and droid factories 
 I liked this even less than the jingoistic, "glory of war" stuff.  I'm still looking for the serious study that views the world as a hard place, recognizes that for a large part of the Middle East, America is a symbol of evil, and criticizes American public policy from the perspective of the tensions of imperfect knowledge and dire threat 
 Fox uniquely attempts to give suggestions on how to keep the best employees. Fox divides his book into fifty short stories that sometimes include a real life situation.  Many of his anecdotes have serious flaws in the basic principles of Organizational Behavior, while others do not fully explain how to handle potential problems.   There are instances where his suggestions can be very useful in becoming a good manager.  At other times, his stories have good concepts, but do have loopholes.  If you were interested in only seeing a small picture of the steps to becoming a great manager, then I would recommend this book to you.   Fox's numerous weaknesses on motivation make me believe that he does not understand some of the basic concepts of motivation.   Furthermore, his continual discussion of avoiding mishires, without any description on how to do that, further weakens his arguments.   I believe this book is for more experienced managers and educated employees who know to extrapolate the good ideas in the book, and ignore the bad 
 I bought this book two days ago and I think that they did'nt even change the guide from the PSP. All the screenshots are on the PSP. Many of the Jumps, Pampages, and missions are wrong. DON'T BUY 
 I was really looking forward to reading this book because it was supposed to deal with the emotional aftermath of an extremely difficult issue (abortion more so than the clinic shooting) faced by a young girl with an unwanted pregnancy.  Rather than discussng this topic in a meaningful way, the book spiraled down into extreme pro-life propoganda and ended up sounding completely ridiculous.  Basically, the basis of the book consists of the following:  Abortion doctors are alcoholics, operate on their patients while drunk, and molest their patients because the patients "don't have any virtue left anyway."  Abortion clinic owners get filthy rich from running abortion clinics and abuse their spouses.  Abortion clinics purposely make women wait to have abortions until the fetus is more developed (even if the woman wants the abortion right away in the first trimester) so the clinic can sell fetus body parts and make more money.  The state health regulators let abortion clinics do whatever they want and ignore any applicable health regulations.  The pro-life advocates, who are all perfect angels, are really the ones who get threatened and harassed and are being unfairly blamed for threats to abortion clinics.  In fact, the shooting at the abortion clinic in this story was really masterminded by the abortion clinic owner to get rid of the drunk doctor.  This book was SO extreme - and is admittedly a story of fiction - yet continued to set forth certain scenarios and statistics as "truth."  I found it embarassing and the prose was not written particularly well.  It does not contribute to the abortion debate in any meaningful way.  I am going to see if I can return this book to Amazon.  I wanted to give it no stars but Amazon makes you have a minimum of one star 
 Philip Slater puts forth with vehemence and passion his opinions on the trends of hyperconsumerism and overindependence that are driving rifts between the people of our nation and diverting much-needed resources from  instituations designed to create health and well-being. His observations  about how middle-class Americans are alienating themselves by placing far  too much emphasis on material possessions, individualistic thought ("I  am different from all of you"), and an economy that is powerfully  rooted in the need to simply consume and produce goods rather than increase  the quality of life are interesting, though a bit dated, and still hold  much relevance to the current situation today.    Still, the phenomena he  rages against are nothing new to the conscientious among us, and there are  many other views on the problems of loneliness and hyperconsumerism that  prey on us. Slater makes powerful points, and he clearly has a deep desire  to see change and the end of the injustices that characterize our century,  but I found his writing style and thought process to be scattered and far  too extremist to inspire me. His book seemed less of an empirical analysis  of the problems facing our nation and what we can do to solve them and more  of an emotional rant about what he personally feels is wrong and where he  feels we all went wrong. Nothing bad about that, it's just he seems so  angry and hurt about it all that he didn't come close to capturing me  (though the chapter about Vietnam and the last chapter were coming close).      It was a good book, but there are far better books written by far more  inspirational people. Carl Rogers ("On Becoming a Person") was a  psychologist who spoke beautifully and wisely for the healing of the  isolation and misunderstandings in our relationships with each other.  Barbara Marx Hubbard ("Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our  Social Potential") writes convincingly and with an uplifting sense of  hope about the problems we face as a people and a culture and what we can  do in the coming decades to move in the direction that Philip Slater longed  for. Both these authors, and many others, rationally describe problems we  all face, then offer warm and well though-out advice about what we can all  do. Slater seems like something of a ranter, and reading his book only  depressed me. But hey, read the book, then move on. Good luck 
 Just to warn you, this product does not come with a USB cable and it doesn't work with most laptops I have had.  You need a desktop for this product and the website for the product is not very helpful at all.  The ecaddy is great, but the caddylink is next to worthless 
 I read half the book and kept falling asleep as I was reading.  The book struck me as naive, tending toward Pollyanna. Excuse me, all you admirers of this book, but this is honestly how I felt about it.  I find life to be so much more complex than his thesis seems to propose - not that there isn't some truth to what he says.  I like what Alfred North Whitehead said, "Morality.... is what the majority then and there happen to like and immorality is what they dislike". The Dalai Lama seems to say it is absolute, but I see it as relative.  
 I love Iain's boat designs and was really looking forward to this book.  I was really disappointed and I have never picked it up since I first read it.  John Brooks' book on Glued Lapstrake Boatbuilding is #1 on my list.  See my review on it.  I just loved his book.  #2 would be Tom Hill's Ultralight Boatbuilding 
 I purchased this dvd as a gift recently and although I'm not exactly JT's number one fan, I enjoyed the performances: very professional, intimate... and his constipated Popeye, white-boy-blues facial contortions are always good for a laugh. For those enamored of his work, this would seem to be a mandatory purchase. I'm writing this review, however, to alert potential buyers to the fact that there seems to be a problem with the disc. A previous reviewer has mentioned the synchronization problem; I noticed that a little bit, but honestly, it didn't seem too blatant (not NEARLY as bad as the dvd of "Stop Making Sense", anyway). The problem with this disc seems to be the audio. I immediately noticed an odd clicking sound throughout the dvd (coming out of the left channel); it seems most obvious on the last 4 or 5 songs. At first I thought it was some sonic anomaly associated with playing in the barn or maybe the clanging of a background singer's jewelry, but on the very last track -- where James is playing solo in a different setting -- the noise is still present. I've talked with Sony a couple of times about the problem, but as of yet have not gotten any confirmation that there IS a problem or that it is being remedied. I'm curious if anyone else has noticed this glitch or if perhaps it is unique to the disc that I bought. At any rate, I just thought I'd give a heads up to those thinking of getting the dvd. From my perspective, the sync issue is not sufficent to avoid the disc, but the audio problem might be 
 So I love Bill Bryson - and have bought many of his books and Cds - however I was dismayed to see something marked as "Audio CD" shipped out which is a weird Ipod nano sized MP3 device with the whole book on it. (appears to be a non-rewriteable MP3 device) Not that that's not a neat idea - but it demands you listen via headphones - I listen at work or while I drive and was expecting a CD - I am returning this item - and looking forward to getting a real CD.  Buyer beware!! But Bill Bryson is a great reader and storyteller 
 I had been told this was an excellent product, so I was very excited to receive it.  However, when I got the item, I was very disappointed in the quality.  It feels light and cheap.  Buttons stick, often requiring 2-3 presses to work.  The "learning" function says it captures a code, but when you attempt to use it, it doesn't work. Despite the claims of Philips that it can learn any remote, it won't.  I tried to "Revert" the remote back to factory settings, as directed by Philips Service department, but it wouldn't reset.  All in all, spent 2 days trying to program and 1 1/2 hours on the phone with tech support.  
 I bought this book because my son started talking about outer space and rockets, etc... I also bought it because we have several other Byron Barton books and my son really enjoys reading and looking at. However, this book is a little boring, doesn't keep his interest and isn't on the same level as the other Barton books 
 Just standard mumbo jumbo. Extremely elementary. The only secret is that it has none 
 I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 I am currently expecting my first child, so maybe I don't have enough first-hand knowledge to really appreciate the message here, but halfway through, I started to feel mildly irritated by this book. Three quarters of the way through, I was actively disgusted, though I can't put my finger on exactly why. I bought this book thinking that it would provide a good counter-balance to a lot of the mainstream parenting literature that wants us to believe that parenting is all joy, all the time. What I got from this is a sense of Ariel Gore's tremendous self-promotion and self-involvement, and a vague and unsettling sense of feeling like I'm doing something wrong for being in a standard-issue and happy heterosexual marriage. As we're reminded frequently, Gore was unwed and backpacking through Europe when she became pregnant. I get the impression that to her mind, we should all be so hard-pressed by circumstances, rather than, say, making an informed and well-timed decision to become parents.   There are a lot of suggestions in the book about taking time for yourself, and not ignoring your spirit and creativity. I agree with the sentiment whole-heartedly, and would have appreciated some insight into the practical implications of how we are to go about doing that. Instead, what we are presented with is a series of poorly-written and half-formed notions of "self-time," with no real insight into the actual reality of having to provide for the care and feeding of your child in your absence. She seems content to sort of noodle her way through a notion, leave off without a conclusion, and remind us how very healthy she is for being able to drop everything to pay attention to her own needs.   I'm not impressed with her or her message, and frankly, I don't understand the great groundswell of support that she appears to enjoy. While her take on motherhood is a different one from what you're most likely to find in mainstream media, that doesn't make it worthwhile by default. There is nothing helpful in this book, and there is no support to be found in a book that just sort of leaves you feeling unimaginative and boring for not having art projects to attend to or never having been on welfare. It's the mother-guilt that she so rails against, just packaged in a more deceptively colorful package. 
 This novel could have been so much better, and it's hard to forget that when reading.  There's no question that the authors know the world they're satirizing inside and out, and at first it's fascinating to have an entree into the world of High Society.  But that fascination isn't enough to carry a whole book (especially when other books take on the same world:  The Nanny Diaries and Bergdorf Blondes).  Melanie Korn is a sweet bubble-headed blonde who's way out of her league.  But unlike say the heroine of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, another book about a social-climbing gal, she lacks the humor and irreverance to make her vulgarity really likable.  The shifting points of view and multiple narrative threads don't help-- there's a really nasty sub-plot about a neighbor who wants to kill his Latina mistress.  The book wants us to sympathize only with him as she's portrayed as a terrifying shrew, but the snobbery is ingrained in the narrative throughout.    Then, once Melanie has her dreams dashed, I kept waiting to see her somehow triumph anyway and make it to the Top via a surprising strategy.  Instead the moral of the story is there's more to Manhattan than  just a few blocks, that people live on the West Side, that love and marriage and children are Good.  Well, duh.  The last thirty pages of the book were a homily to the joys of the Real World-- it's well meant but terribly condescending.  Where do they think their readers live?  The two mean gossips who narrate some of the book are tiresome, and never get the comeuppance they really deserve.  I gave this two stars because it's such a missed opportunity.  With better editing and direction this could have been a sort of Jane Austen type book for our times.  Instead, it's just a minor example of gossip lit.  The prose is fair-- better than The Devil Wears Prada but nowhere near the humor and elegance of The Nanny Diaries.  It's a quick read, but there are better quick reads out there.  On the plus side, the book does leave you feeling grateful the world of High Society is so very irrelevant.  Ah, you say as you shut it, thank goodness I am middle class 
 I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.   Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.   This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.   That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.   Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.   Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.   They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered "scary" is with the cheap haunted-house "BOO!" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.   Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.  Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better. 
 Seems to me that not too many people have read that book: the ratings are either "I hate it!" or "I love it" - with NOTHING in between......Fishy, isn't it? I my opinion, people who have read it hate it, and book pushers rate it highest. Shame. Read "Alcoholics Anonymous" and you will see the light. Useless, untrue book 
  I got this mat for my 3 month old, I was very disappointed with it. It is a very hard plastic,..and has sharp edges. It isn't plyable enough for a baby to pat and play with.. I was swooshing the water around trying to soften it up some and it split at it's cheap and sharp seems..Water went everywhere.. Thank god my infant wasn't playing near or on this product when this happened. I won't be buying anything from WHOOZIT again 
 Hmmm...I think I missed a whole lot of somethings.  This is a dreadful novel.  I'll admit, I picked it up because the movie is currently in theaters.  I should have known better.  A review of the movie..."...convoluted plot, ambiguous characters, confusing..." should have scared me off.  Each time I picked it up, I had to re-read a few pages, to figure out who was who and what was or wasn't happening.  I tried to finish this book...honest...but, all too soon, it got tossed in the "drop off at the club" pile.  I never even took the time to read the last few chapters to see what happened.  Why?  Because I had no urge to know.    Will I watch the movie?  Well, maybe, because I like the actors...but, only once it's offered, free, on "On Demand."  I've spent enough money on this overly-hyped, drivel of a story 
 I am a long-time quilter who loves modern patterns and innovative design; I was so excited to see this book.  When it arrived I knew after flipping through it once that I would be returning it--and I never return quilt books. Be aware that hardly any of the patterns are for quilts--most are for household objects.   And what's frustrating about those patterns for things like slippers is that they don't seem as though they would produce results that are going to hold up well.  Oh well.  I'd recommend that non-beginners skip this and get two great Kerr/Ringle books: Color Harmony for Quilters and The Modern Quilt Workshop instead. 
 Seriously you dont need me to tell you wack this album is, if you've ever heard it you'll know yourself the depths that this album plummets to.  I'll be honest, I heard Thug Lovin on the radio and thought it was O.K, all the other singles though, Mesmerize etc.. were s**t.  A friend of mine offered to burn me a copy, free of charge, and i thought fine, what's the worst that could happen, I was mistaken, I would compare listening to this with torture.  If your into sing along pop songs, with a little bad language for good measure, you may like this album.  To put this in the hip-hop genre is misleading, Ja actually attempts to 'sing' half the songs on here, and when he's not singing he does his best Tupac impression.  Thankfully at the time of writing this, his career appears to be over, if we can rid the hip-hop world of Nelly and 50 Cent as well, the world would be much better  for it.  Avoid any albums by this phoney.  Message to the honorable, agreed most of the rappers listed are s**t, but Ja destroying Snoop, Eazy-E, Mack 10 and DMX, don't talk s**t, this diva couldn't touch any of them.  After writing this I noticed someone was selling this album on Amazon for 1 cent, that should tell you all you need to know about it 
 Some interesting dialogue sprinkled about within a mostly nonsensical, dull, and slow plot.  Also, the whole thing is in Swedish with hard to read English subtitles.  Blah.  The film critics will love this one because it gives them bizarre, convoluted material upon which to ponder self-importantly.  It's really not worth pondering, though.  
 I ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic. However, this  kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water. I boiled it a few times plus tried the water/vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help. I decided that I didn't want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so I'm returning it - it's not worth the risk. I can't figure out if it's coming from the "stainless steel" bulb  (that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass & the bulb. Plus the lid has a stong odor too & that is plastic covered in "stainless steel" 
 I hated this book. The author tries too hard to make everyone fit into the pretty little box she has created. Not all women are dominant, just like not males are submissive. Psychology, pssh. She pulls her evidence out of thin air. I resold this book as soon as I finished it. Horrible 
 I have been trying to order this from Amazon since October 2005. Twice now they have delayed and delayed the delivery for months only to finally cancel the order. They clearly do not have access to this book 
 This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen.  Don't let the title or the box fool you.  Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment.  I was shocked that such a film could come out of France.  If you're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass (verbally and physically) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job, then rent this and snack on a can of worms.  HIDEOUS 
 I was hoping for more, but I found I got the usual dreck from the Schrecks. There is nothing of their own from this, only information that anyone could find by using a good search engine ... They also tend to focus on the more abhorant, fetishistic sexual behaviours such as the consuming of bodily excreta while presenting it in a dry, uninspired tone. It looks like the Schrecks have used either themselves or one of their cronies to write the first review which waxes far more poetically than the text of the book 
 Actually this is not Inspector Wexford's first case, but the first that Rendell wrote with him as the main character.  In fact, if I'm not mistaken, this was her first mystery, period.  And it's surprisingly dull, as far as I'm concerned.  The "shocking" conclusion to me was obvious from the first few chapters -- I can't tell you why without giving it away -- and now, 30 years later, not so shocking.  In fact, by today's standards, it's pretty tame, even quaint.  The caliber of Rendell's work soars with her next mystery "Wolf to the Slaughter" and from there she just gets better and better.  But this first effort didn't do it for me.  Don't base your opinion of Rendell on this book -- unless you love it, of course! -- but do check out the rest of the Wexford mysteries, which are sublimely written and -- yes, truly -- shocking in their conclusions! 
 The journal content is good, but the book is a typically-bound softcover which does not lend well to journaling (spiral-bound books which lay open flat or fold back are much better). The biggest disappointment was the Shopping Guide section which, according to the front of the book, "features shopping lists for fat-flushing foods". They are merely bulleted lists of foods used in each phase of the plan, grouped by category (vegetables, proteins, etc.)  It would have been more helpful to have actual shopping lists by week, based on the plan menus. 
 In a nutshell: Don't waste your money on this version.  The original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century, but the introduction and further editing by Anatol Rapaport (a biologist and a musician, not a political scientist or historian), make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst.  Rapaport, for being an editor of Clausewitz, was not a believer in the trinitarian system (primordial violence, non-rational actions, and rationality)- probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second Trinities (army, people, and government).  If this is the only one you can get, then live with it.  The first chance you get, get the much clearer, much more straightforward Paret/Howard translation, which is the one that's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 Enough takes the formulaic made-for TV battered woman story and actually makes a big screen movie sillier than its cheesy small screen counterparts. Another entry into pseudo-feminist category, Enough is a hypocritical movie that preaches empowerment but constantly shows its heroine being objectified and degraded. I hope by reading this review you'll avoid this horrible movie. Enough follows Slim, a waitress working at a Seattle Diner. (Strange she won't identify herself with her real name but objectifies herself by calling herself a shape) We never learn about Slim or her goals in life, she's just a beautiful woman in need of rescuing from her dead-end job. At work She meets up with a Mitch, a handsome rich customer. He woos her; after only minutes of screen time they're in love. Her unassuming "Nice Guy(tm)" boss warns her that Mitch bet him that he could get her into bed. He has the hots for her, too but Mr. Insecure doesn't say anything outside of that passive-aggressive(tm) warning. Despite OBVIOUS WARNING SIGNS about Mitch's CHARACTER Slim continues dating him. Golddigger is just happy to have a rich man sweep her off her feet and save her. So Slim marries Mitch Charming and he decides to buy some guy's house just because he can. Oooh. POWER ISSUES. They have a child, but he won't let her hold her after giving BIRTH to her. Oooh. CONTROL ISSUES. Slim, distracted by Mitch's money can't see BIG RED FLAGS in front of her. It's not until five years later when she gets a call from another woman that she learns he's cheating on her. Instead of quietly taking money out of the joint account, and filing the divorce papers THEN, she confronts him. This leads to Mitch becoming abusive although he's never displayed this behavior previously. Psychology books say batterers have a PATTERN of behavior with women they date, but this movie follows Bizarro logic. He beats Slim down and slaps the kid around for good measure so we can hate him. Slim goes to the cops with a huge bruise on her face but decides to NOT have him arrested or take out a restraining order, fearing he'll take her daughter. She actually believes the malarkey a desk sergeant tells her about the legal system instead of consulting an attorney. Scared, she makes a run for it in the night. But Mitch thwarts her escape plans. After another beatdown, he menaces her adoptive Dad and friend with a gun saying they're trespassing. When she tries another run for it, he freezes her financial assets. So with borrowed money, Slim takes her daughter to a motel. There, Mitch makes a threatening call saying he's everywhere. You'd think after being beaten TWICE she'd keep a tape recorder on hand to record moments like this for EVIDENCE. Making TERRORISTIC THREATS over the phone is a FELONY. Mitch breaks open the hotel door and Slim has to escape. They head up to Seattle where her "Nice Guy(tm)" friend lets them stay with him and puts his passive(tm) moves on her. Cop friends of Mitch pose as FBI. They rough him up, knock down stuff and cut up a sofa. Stupid Mitch doesn't know that "Nice Guy(tm)" would be a WITNESS and these cops would be facing charges from IAB and FBI because Mitch's pockets aren't fat enough to protect them from FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGES. Yes, Mitch here was STUPID enough to cross STATE LINES to commit his crimes. But Slim never keeps a RECORD of these incidents for EVIDENCE. She goes to real dad in San Fran for help, but gets none. You'd THINK she'd go to a library and study those wonderful Federal and state laws on the books and would be preparing her case with prosecutors. Not wanting to endanger her friends, Slim heads to another city. Detroit, Orlando, they all somehow look Like San Francisco in this movie. Turns out Mitch has friends even in THIS city to help him do his dirty work. Mitch may be a rich, real estate guy, but I don't think anyone is THIS well connected. He coincidentally knows cops in EVERY city Slim goes to? Come on. The cop he enlists to help him is aware that he's committing a crime, but follows orders. Mitch makes more terroristic threats over the phone that Slim isn't smart enough to record for EVIDENCE. This leads to a silly car chase where Slim is SMART ENOUGH TO EVADE HIM ON ROADS SHE KNOWS BUT NOT SMART ENOUGH TO CALL 911 DURING THE CHASE. Terrified, Slim heads back to San Francisco. Dad now decides to help out with his money and connections. Under Daddy's protection, Slim decides to FINALLY get legal advice from an attorney. She also decides to become "empowered" by training to kick Mitch's butt. I'd rather see her train to kick his butt in court with all the evidence shown throughout the movie, but she decides two wrongs will make right. Committing First-degree murder is far more satisfying to her than seeing Mitch and his colleagues go to prison. Final act, Slim breaks into Mitch's house. She plants signal jammers and shuts out the lights. "Empowered" in her belly baring cleavage-exposing black spandex outfit she prepares to confront him. She throws down with Mitch in one of the stupidest fight scenes ever filmed. It's never smart for a woman to take a man on in a fistfight because: A MAN IS EIGHT TIMES STRONGER IN HIS UPPER BODY THAN A WOMAN. He could have KILLED Slim with ONE PUNCH. It happens all the time in real life. Seriously. But following the Bizarro logic of this movie, Slim not only beats the crap out of the s Mitch, she KILLS him. After committing murder, (a handwriting expert would have easily figured out her letters were forgeries during the investigation), Slim goes on to live happily ever after with her "Nice Guy(tm)" diner owner friend, not knowing that he's just like man she just murdered. (Read my review of The Last American Virgin to learn why "Nice Guys(tm)" are dangerous.) Like its contemporaries The Rich Man's Wife, Gang of Roses, and Catwoman in the Pseudo Feminist genre, Enough makes a mockery of feminism with its sexist message of "empowerment." The wrongheaded ideas in this movie tell women to overcome domestic violence with violence, not seek counseling to deal with the emotional trauma or plan a legal strategy. It's interesting to note like in those other mentioned movies, the more "empowered" Slim becomes, the less clothing she wears. We never get to see Slim's face during the movie, only her body parts. This segmenting of her body takes away from her humanity and prevents us from connecting with her emotionally. Production values on this movie are not "Enough" considering the talent. The poorly written screenplay has dialogue that comes from the first draft of a Learning Annex student. Scenes don't transition into each other smoothly leading to a disjointed uneven story. Plain and simple, the acting is downright wretched in this movie. Jennifer Lopez is horrible in the role of Slim. She plays her character with no emotion in most scenes and is over the top in others. Billy Campbell is ridiculous to watch as the batterer. He is a cartoon character who gets more over the top with each scene.  Don't get "Enough" at all. Pick up the far superior Sleeping with the Enemy.  
 It is indeed frightening to see the number of reviewers on this page who agree with Pat Buchanan's insane assumption that America is like Rome being sacked by hordes of barbarians. This only goes to show the true moral decay in the U.S. culture, a decay in its treatment and understanding of the other peoples of the world, and we are supposed to be the ones exporting "democracy" and "freedom" to the Middle East? In "State Of Emergency" Buchanan has created no less than the perfect condensed sample of the new racist thinking in contemporary America, where those immigrating from the Americas are seen as nothing less than unskilled peasants, eventhough the Americas produced potent cultures long before Columbus ever arrived. Buchanan never even addresses one reason why the Americas have been so ill-run, BECAUSE WE HAVE HELPED ESTABLISH JUNTAS AND DICTATORSHIPS IN THE REGION. We need only look at the 1973 coup in Chile where we helped establish a military dictatorship or in recent times with the CIA-backed attempted coup on Hugo Chavez in 2002. Oh, but we are but innocent Americans being flooded by unwanted peoples. Buchanan in this work completely outlines the thought process of the typical radical conservative, which is a fear of change, of the march of history. "State Of Emergency" is nothing but a propaganda piece for people locked to a past THAT IS GONE. America will NEVER return to the 1950s, 40s or 1800s because these are eras that have come and gone, no empire, culture etc. has ever survived the centuries unphased. But Buchanan will have you believe that white American culture is the only way to go, forget the fact that there were Natives here when the pilgrims arrived, the only way conservatives believe is correct is their way and they will struggle and cry to bend everyone else to their will. "State Of Emergency" as a book is also simply a boring read, Buchanan is as exciting to read as a Manhattan phone book, his prose is dry and his points repetitive and paranoid. How sad to think that in a "civilized" or "advanced" society this kind of dribble is still taken seriously, especially by the "intellectual" a few reviews below who agrees with Buchanan that people from the Americas are not worth anything as human beings, using rhetoric worthy of the KKK. "State Of Emergency" is pathetic and more scary than appealing, scary because it shows that in contemporary America, figures in power still espouse the ideas of men like Jim Crow and Adolf Hitler. 
 The fact that this book has received nearly all five star ratings confirms my belief that the majority of modern-day Americans are practically illiterate.  There is nothing particularly profound in this book, and much that is mis-leading.  A couple of examples: an early Celtic Christian prayer is quoted, but omitting most of the prayer and its references to God and the angels, so that it appears that the prayer is pantheistic (which in its true form is not).  Also in the first chapter we are told that the Celts were "nature people".  Well, I suppose that you could say that most of the tribes in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America two thousand years ago were "nature people".  In other words, the enlightenment in this book has more to do with New-Age fancy and 19th century exoticism than historical reality.  If you want something legitimately mystical, and a thousand times more profound, try volume 1 of the Philokalia, or The Way of A Pilgrim.  Sorry if I sound arrogant; I'm not.  I just hate to see people get taken in by this stuff when there are truly great works languishing in obscurity because you might have to read a page three times a day for three days before you get it...but when you do get it, you KNOW you've got something.  Peace.  Out 
 I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I read, "For Better or Worse", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. It kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because I didnt' have anything else to do. I am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.    I totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. There were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. To me, Matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. I think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage.   If you want to read something good, pick up a Jane Green novel instead.  
 This book expects a lot out of students, thereby requiring instructors to work even harder at presenting the material in a meaningful and understandable way.  Unless students have previously had precalculus (including trigonometry), or had a thorough preparation in algebra, this text will be highly confusing and discouraging to most of them.  It is an inadequate preparation for calculus at best, as it completely omits many key concepts that will be necessary for the study of calculus.  This is a well written book for mathematicians, but not for students just grappling to learn this material.  Unfortunately, there are those who are involved with the "Calculus Reform" that believe this "Applied Approach" is the best approach.  If people really wants to learn about applied mathematics, they need not look any further than physics 
 I was very disappointed with the fact that this being a book on photography had the photos being refered to in newsprint black and white quality. I must add that the original was available to see on the web.  What a pain, this book would have been much better and more interesting had the color images been in the book. There are some color photos located in the center of the book. Also the information is repetative and not presented in an interesting way.  I think that both the editor and writer could have done a much better job.  I am glad I only paid $1.88 plus shipping for this book.  The 500 pages could have been reduced to 200.  An "image speaks a thousand words!" isn't that what photography is all about 
 Nostalgia usually hits people with warm fuzzy feelings and this book has its share of them. All in all, I don't think the book quite hit its mark. I was entertained by a few stories but I was expecting much more since many of the reviews here had such high praise. I think the warm fuzzies that some people get by reading about their childhood memories overshadows the point that the book really isn't all that great. This is a great topic for a book and hopefully a better one will come along later 
 I wrote you that this DVD did not work, it was would not play. I have no other problems with any other DVDs. You did not respond!!!!!!!!!!!11 You took my money and gave me something worthless!!!!!!!!!!1

 One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun.  Quite the reverse.  He has cut it in half.  The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either.  Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half.  Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes  Even the plot is tissue-thin.  The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring.  Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction.  As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one.  He is capable of far better.  
 This is a horrible movie with no redeeming value. I realize that such a knock will actually drive people to purchase this. Let me bring something to you attention.  This is a slasher movie with effective gore. In fact, for the time, the gore was more sick that similar movies. However, there are no scares, no suspense, no clever script, no story and it has a stupic ending. I know, that applies to most gore movies!  The problem with this movie is that it is overly mean spirited towards women (I am a man, a 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy that also raises a family).  The story, which has a guy killing women b/c of mistreatment from his mother, seems like it was written and directed by a person that shares the same demons as the killer of the film.    The murders in this movie are so mean-spirited (yet with no cinematic value) that a normal movie goer would have to be offended. This movie is not sick in a "good" movie way but rather sick in an ashamed manner.   This is a woman-bashing movie that should make any viewer feel guilty that they are patronizing this garbage. A movie should have an entertainment value. There is no cinematic, artistic touch on this film.  This is simply a mean, mean movie!    
 I never made it past the first three chapters (even though we were assigned to read the whole thing).  The long, drawn out epistomology (the study of knowledge) and boring examples (sucked the life out of Little Red Ridinghood) was so hard to get through, I probably never made it to the good stuff.  Definitely not fun, exciting reading for the average person.  The only interesting thing to me was the constant use of the phrase "the proof is in the pudding".  But then again, I'm not a scholar 
 Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes 
 Approximately 250 pages of hybridised vacuity build from snippets of information coralled together.  I can best describe this work as almost entirely cliche ridden.  It is further evidence that human computer interaction studies are largely 'solutions' in search of problems.  The chapter on 'mega-creativity' is replete with casual opinion and banal anecdotes.  Likewise chapters on the 'new education' and 'new medicine' are pitched several degrees below what the average Time or News Week reader would expect in content.  Overall this is a poor piece of work in terms of content and I regret having wasted money on it.  At some point in time, I hope that a Shokal equivalent emerges to debunk the self-aggrandising twaddle that typifies most HCI work. 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Again we have some Christians trying to escape biblical and moral requirements.  We have a problem with religion today in that many want to be a Catholic for example but can not comply with the rules.  Each religion does have a moral path or rules of engagement.   According to Lev. 18 it is a blasphemy for a man to lay with another man.  Jesus himself does not directly say that homosexuality is wrong but he does not attack most sin.  He does however make it clear to "keep my fathers laws".  There are 613 LAWS from G_d (the father) and Lev 18 is of course is part of them.   Christians seem to be occupied with homosexuality though there are many sins just as bad under the eyes of G_D.   Christians have historically denied the commandment of Jesus to keep his fathers laws  and those two in Mark 12 28-32 and thus by history or culture refuse most of them. Examples of this are: Exodus 20 4th comm. SABBATH, Kosher food laws and many more.  Its as though Christianity was allowed (so it would seem) to pick and choose what G_d wanted.    Jews look at this issue like this:  The laws were given to the "chosen" and therefore Gentiles must only follow the 7 laws of Noah in Genesis 9. The laws for the Gentiles (NOAH was the first GOYEM-Gentile)  These by the way are paraphrased in Mathew.  So, to a JEW its fine for a Christian to be gay as the laws of NOAH do not state homosexuality as a sin.  Now, there are Catholics and other denominations of Christianity who over the course of history have made sure that certain sins are still treated as such.  This is partly the influence of Paul and the Nicean Council.  If one is a Catholic and is also a homosexual then by the doctrine of this faith you must either repent or leave the faith.  I dont understand why so many try to justify loop holes.  If ones son for example is gay and they are Catholic or for that matter Orthodox Jew then they must be forgiven but...they can not be of that faith.  Rules of engagment.   I am a adult male and can not join the girl scouts becuase of my age and gender. Religions have rules too and if you are unable to follow them by the "book" then try one you can.  Its very simple.  Besides, why belong to a faith or any group that goes against your lifestyle?  Its like a JEW wanting to be a member of the KKK  or a gay man wanting to be Catholic. Rules are rules.   
 It almost seemed like the acting got worse after every season.  I'm really a big fan of what's happening. There is a episode where Raj is singing a ballad which I found really funny, because I never thought I would ever see Earnest Thomas (raj) sing a song with so much sincerity.  The third season is really corny, however, if you have  been a on going fan you will enjoy watching many of the episodes.....if you were never a fan of what's happening! don't waste your money, or just buy the second  season (the best season)  and call it  a day 
 Boring -- Don't waste your money folks! I thought I was going to read some great things in critical pedagogy! The title should have been "...and unfocused rantings." She tries to make these "words" or "phrases of wisdom" and all they are is nonsense. They are so high falutin' I didn't get it and this is my favorite subject!!! or were they just stupid rantings. I can not express how terribly dissapointed I was. I'll never pick up another book by her. One star is the lowest I could go, if there was a 0 rating I would have used that 
 In Behe's chapter he states that the bacterial flagellum contains 40 protein parts and that this structure is irreducibly complex. However, a recent paper in Nature Reviews Microbiology by Pallen and Matzke show that Behe made a sweeping generalization by saying "the flagellum" (there are literally thousands of flagellar structures; not one)and many of the flagellar structures require far less than 40 proteins!!!! So much for irreducible complexity. The DI apparently did not do their research. An accesible critique of this is at the Panda's Thumb by Nick Matzke, or the ID to the future podcast comments. 
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 I actually feel sorry for Jessica.  She reminds me of Jennifer Lopez in that she is always striving one way or another to get the attention of the public, regardless, of how it affects those around her.  This book is another self indulgent compliment to her narcisstic self as the book cover confirms.  Personally, I don't find her really that beautiful.  I can't help feeling Nick felt ripped off marrying this doll of the media.  Good luck to them both.  What happens after the dream wedding is achieved?  Will they both live happily ever after in their day-to-day regular life as a married couple?  I guess we all know the answer.  
 After a night of passion with Gabriel Jones (the gentleman who had hired her to photograph his collection), photographer Venetia Milton is saddened to read that Gabriel has lost his life in a fire. Deciding to make use of this opportunity, Venetia poses as Gabriel's widow and moves her family to London, where she opens a new portrait shop. Imagine her surprise then when Gabriel walks into to drawing room many months later, very much alive. Apparently, someone wants access to some papers that they think Gabriel has, and he had pretended to play dead in order to discover who had tried to kill him. But now, with Venetia pretending to be his widow, Gabriel is afraid that the killer will come after Venetia. Venetia is stunned, and a little miffed that her plans have come crashing down around her; after all a live husband was the last thing she expected to have to contend with. But with her life, and potentially that of her loved ones at stake, Venetia will have to put her ire behind her and work with Gabriel. But can she? For Venetia has secrets that she'd rather not share, esp with the man she's so terribly attracted to...  I know that the last few novels by Amanda Quick haven't exactly been stellar ones --esp when one compares them with her earlier work "Seduction," "Scandal, etc. But there's always been something, even in her less than stellar works for one to grab onto -- a good storyline, good chemistry between the hero and heroine, suspense. This time around, however, everything seems very flat and very formulaic. The storyline is a variation of one that has been used a number of times, the chemistry between the hero (Gabriel) and the heroine (Venetia) is almost nonexistent, and the villain of the piece not only sticks out a mile (the villain might as well have carried a sign saying "here I stand, come and get me.") Who would have thought that there would come the day when I would actually give an Amanda Quick novel 2 stars?   The shame of it was that the storyline, although it was much used intrigue/mystery subplot, had quite a bit going for it. However, while one can overlook the fact that an author has much used a very familiar subplot, slightly harder to overlook is the fact that the interaction between the hero and heroine in "Second Sight" lacked sparkle. From the manner in which the first few chapters unfolded, I rather thought that I was going to like Venetia quite a bit -- she seemed intelligent and very capable. But while, thank goodness, Amanda Quick did not allow her heroine to behave in an extremely foolish manner even once, she did make her seem rather obtuse at times. Gabriel, on the other hand, was easy to like and take to, even if his character was under-developed -- and really, one has little choice but to approve of a hero who possesses a sense of humour. All in all, though, this was a disappointing read: the historical aspect was mere wall papering (and although I realize that for many readers this is not a priority. I rather like a little more detail in these historical novels), the suspense was lacking, as was the chemistry between Venetia and Gabriel, and the storyline just lacked energy and vivacity. If you are a fan, by all means read this book, but be forewarned, it is nothing like her earlier works. If you've never picked up an Amanda Quick romance novel, than choose one of her earlier works instead (esp her "S" series), you won't be disappointe 
 Every since Bill Maher made his sympathetic comments with regard for the cowardly terrorists who caused so much pain for this country on 9/11, I've had no use or interest in his musings whatever they may be. I encourage anyone who considers purchasing anything that will benefit him to consider this 
 Lipstadt is patently an intelligent author, and some of her in depth analyses bring some discrepancies to light, statistical and other, in the works of David Irving. However, any historian, journalist, or writer in general could be found to have an equal level of faults in their works.   Irving is one of the integral historians of WW2 and Nazism. His research has probably brought more new evidence and data to light than any single historian of this era. The bibliography of any work of note on this period in history will contain references to Irving's work. The vast amounts of data, and the unique and varied nature of his sources, have made his contribution priceless.    Lipstadt criticises his fluctuating figures, on, say the victims of Dresden. Yes, his estimates have varied, but then history in general is prone to evolution, rarely are such figures maintained as 100% accurate as decades pass. Especially the field Irving works in - what with the cold war, massive amoutns of integral material laid hidden for years, even decades.    I would also state the statistics of Auschwitz victims have fallen from 6 million to less than 1 million in the last 50 years, very gradually. This represents much wider change than Irving's figures, and illustrates the evolution of historical analysis.    The scariest part of this whole book/trial is that the expert historians who testified against Irving were paid £500,00. Very, very sinister. History, indeed, on trial. And if you're reading of it differs from what it's supposed, prepare to face annihalation. Remember Salman Rushdie and Iran? People in America and Europe decried the 'backward and fanatical' Iran for attacking the author. Look closer to home, and be very afraid.. 
 Nick Hornby is, without a doubt, one of the best novelists of the last 50 years. When people look back at what it was like to live in the 1990s, his novels will be the ones people turn to.  Until this one.  I have a strong suspicion that this was some leftover idea from the days before Hornby was famous, that he dusted off to make another payday. Certainly, if it was written by an unknown author, it would have been soundly rejected by all but the vanity publishing presses. There is so much wrong with this disaster of a novel that it is hard to know where to begin.   Hornby's chosen an interesting premise - the idea of how to be good is an engaging one. Unfortunately, his ideas are the ones that we all have when we are 15-year-old teenagers and think we know better than every adult. Hornby has confused some very simplistic, paper-thin twaddle with genuine ideas, and tries to carry an entire novel with them. As you might guess, it doesn't work.  He's enough of a good writer to lure you in at the beginning with some good, solid, entertaining writing and an interesting initial premise. It soon becomes clear, however, that his characters are completely implausible, wooden props who are just moved in little patterns to promote the dubious teenage ideas. If this was done for humor or some kind of commentary, it would be endurable - in this instance, it quickly becomes pointless. It's even more excruciating because he's trying to write with humor - nothing worse than seeing an unfunny comedian, and this book has that same sinking feeling throughout.   I kept reading, partly out of sheer amazement that such an outstanding writer could create something this godawful - and also in the hope that it might get better. It didn't, and I suspect Hornby knew it too, because he writes himself into a corner and has no idea how to end the novel.  By the end, I was feeling insulted - not only that I'd wasted my money, but that people might be put off actually trying to lead good and charitable lives, by thinking Hornby's shallow, dull-witted themes were the only possible ways this could be done. He not only fails to explore a good premise, he cheapens and insults it with this lump of self-righteous ignorance.  A shallow, turgid, trite, tired, banal, self-righteous, unengaging, pointless, lumpy mess of a book, by a novelist who thought he had something to say and instead is revealed to be another irritating, kneejerk, preaching type. To be avoided at all costs - especially if you are over sixteen and have already grown out of this kind of misdirected moralizing 
 i got charged for this and havent gotten it. what bulls** 
 Regrettably, this book simply fails to prove its central thesis: that from earliest times, Jesus was simply included within the unique identity of God. First, Bauckham is absolutely incorrect that Jewish monotheism was in any sense "strict" in Jesus' day. As is becoming increasingly clear, the type of monotheism he thinks Jews followed in the first century does not even begin to come about till the 3rd century. Even scholars as conservative as N T Wright acknowledge this.  Second, he dismisses the Enoch literature too easily, as well as large amounts of the Pseudepigrapha. Clearly, Jews were capable of thinking of of more than one divine figure along with God. Even a simple reading of I Enoch will reveal that.  Third, he dismisses other evidence that, according to his criteria, would make other patriarchs like Moses be included in God's unique identity. As can be easily seen from Larry Hurtado's One God, One Lord, Jews could conceive of exalted figures exercising divine prerogatives--without monotheism having to be rethought! If the exercise of divine prerogatives=divinity, Jewish literature abounds with Trinities.  Fourth, he underestimates the *earliest* Christology: Jesus was a man accredited by God. Christ is clearly subordinated--both functionally and ontologically--to God; Bauckham ignores the Pauline evidence for this. Paul continually speaks of "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"; that God worked "through" Jesus; that there is "one God and one Lord". But this he ignores because a few passages in the NT seem to indicate otherwise. In other words, the rabbit he pulls out of the hat is one he had to put in there in the first place.  In other words, his thesis fails on every single point by making gross generalizations and by ignoring massive amounts of evidence, dismissing anything that counters his argument as irrelevant. This is not good scholarship; this is making texts say what he wants them to say.  This is hardly to deny the Trinity; nor is it to say that there is not other evidence for it (see Neil Richardson's brilliant "Paul's Language about God"). It is merely to say that THIS book proves absolutely nothing, other than the author is desperately grabbing at anything that will prove his point. 
 I got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term, risky cells. It could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but I'm not willing to chance it again 
 Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. Bought Gourmet cook book instead 
 Decent starting point for cooking-impaired college students if they don't mind eating eggs and potatoes often.  A little more variation in the recipes would be nice as well as some pointers on how to substitute ingredients and an explanation on why some ingredients do (What is the purpose of using cornstarch?  I know, some of it is common sense, but heyyyyyyy.... I'm a stupid college student). For example, for one recipe for frying chicken, I used pork and it tasted fine.     Also, some of the recipes don't really work.  Baking chicken drumsticks at 375 degrees in the oven for 40 minutes is not enough for thoroughly cooked chicken.     On the upside, the cooking tips were really helpful.  The book could use more of those, like be aware that if you heat oil, it pops and it could land on your face or burn your arm.  Overall, this book provides some ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it too much.  Not really worth the purchase.  Flip through it in the bookstore like I did and save some bucks for uhhh.... buying food. = 
 I have yet to see a honest approach to this complex subject that does other than portray the Jews as victims.  There is never any acknolwedgement that all people and, yes, all races/cultures, at time do very bad things to each other.  Except for the Jews.  With them it is always someone else's fault. Even now, as they do their best to destroy the Palestinians, after invading their homes, stealing their dignity and turning Gaza into another Warsaw Ghetto, they refuse to admit that what they are doing is wrong.  And let's not forget that the Arabs are also semites, when we go throwing that "anti-semite" ajective around.  There are Jews who recognize and speak out on this problem, such as Norman Finklestein and Gore Vidal.  And there are, thankfully, Jewish run organizations in Israel who are fighting for the human rights of the Palestinians, realizing that it is the ongoing mistreatment of others, the continuing claim that Israel is above reproach, that is creating a negative image of Israel - they are doing this to themselves.  They are their own worst enemy.  
 West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment.  In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.  The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.  At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.  The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota.  On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.  There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.  Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.  As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated.  I can honestly say it never got my full atention. 
 Nine days from MN to PA seems too long; perhaps Target Direct got process problems.   I AM NOT SATISIFIED...got the same three pack of bottles which I bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local CVS for $1.50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it 
 This book is not at all what it promises to be.  Very basic with poor indexing and little in-depth informatio 
 Now where's the old John Stossel who stood up for consumers against sleazy scams perpatrated by corrupt businesses? Guess he thought it's better to steal all the taxpayer money than to fight for taxpayer justice. For all his ramblings in this book, he might as well blabber on the Emmy Awards and get lost ! Let's see how this clown fares when the public lion wakes up and tears his ligaments to shreds  
 I have no doubt Will Eisner's intentions were noble in writing this book. I'm also not here to disparage a widely acknowledged great in the comics industry. And yet...   It comes as no surprise that this emanates from a series of academic lectures as it smacks of a non-academic striving desperately both to sound learned and informed and to give serious academic weight to a subject generally percieved as throwaway entertainment.   Will Eisner was a great, but a great of a very different era and as such he has very little relevance visually to the world of comics today. That's not to say he's inferior to a lot of the hacks passing themselves off as 'cartoonists' these days, but if you want to work in that industry as an artist (thus producing sequential ART) then this book is a fraction of the use of the superior (that's right SUPERIOR) Scott McCloud book "Understanding Comics".   So do yourself a favour and buy that instead.   Oh, and using lots of big (and inappropriate to the medium) words doesn't make you sound smart, either.   Sorry 
 The narcissim, banality and lack of intelligent thought in this book is simply stunning.  I am a new mother, and I cannot fathom how this book would have been useful to me during pregnancy;  certainly not in retrospect.  Because I also share a lot of Walker's racial/sexual/class/political experience I bought this immediately. I was deeply offended by a lot of her claims about feminism and what she insinuates about lesbian vs. heterosexual parenting, but truly jaw-dropping is her assertion about biological vs. non-biological parenting.  She is so unable to get past herself, and so unable to recognize that her first stab at "parenting" was more playing house with an immature rocker and less the stuff of intentional motherhood.  Perhaps that is part of what undermines the bond with her son that she then goes on to universalize.  The revelations about the breach with her mother are frankly embarassing, and again, feel self-serving--like a desperate stab to hook a readership that she can't otherwise win and hold.    
 Too cut and dry and textbook like. I need a little giggle or side note every now and again 
 This book is an interesting read.  The Author Marc Elliot is good at prose...and unlike some readers, I do not mind the occasional un-dotted I...etc.  My problem with this book is different.  The author is clearly trying to break down the 'good guy' image of Stewart.  He comes up with all sorts of (in my opinion) phony sexual stories about Stewart including that he visited a MGM sponsored brothel in order to prove his 'heterosexuality.'  Come on...this is garbage.  Also, he doesent miss a chance at the old Marlene Deitrich abortion story which I believe to be 'hooey' to use a Jimmy word.  The author states that JS is a feminine hero and that many of his films have sexual undertones.  I just don't believe this...and the fact that the author has written for Penthouse really sets the stage for what you are in for.  This is a very biased book.  And I wouldnt recomend it.   Also, before you spend money on this book...research the author.  I didn't do this until I had purchased the book and I learned that his previous material doesent seem to fit.  He is most known for a book entitled  "Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince" The Jimmy Stewart book (in my opinion-again) does an extreme disservice to JS.  The author misses some of his movies entirely and also misses "The Six Shooter" radio series that Jimmy did for NBC in the 50's.  The book is interesting to read (Marc is a great story teller)...but the dirt doesent stick (never has) and I would'nt believe a word of it if I were you.  Finally, I don't like the 'Jimmy was thinking/feeling' additions...there is simply no way to know what the man was thinking.  Take my advice and let Jimmy's films speak for themselves.       
 First, I will confess that this is the first time I have bought one of Dozois "best of" books new rather than used.  I have never considered his collections worth paying full price, but amongst the dross I have always found two or three real gems that was I glad to discover.  I have come to conclude these gems must have been included by complete accident.  When I saw "Best of the Best", I assumed that he had decided to put out a book spanning several years, using gems only, skipping the filler.  Well, I was wrong, and feel cheated out of the price of this book!  I slogged through page after page of stories ranging from mediocre to poor, with nary a gem in sight.  I understand that Dozios did not actually write these stories, and therefore did not create the turgid prose, sloppy plotting, hackneyed and pedestrian themes, and uninteresting characters that fill these stories.  He is, however, responsible for choosing them and holding them up to the public as the "best" examples of a genre that has so much more to offer than a reader unfamiliar with science fiction might conclude it does based upon this book 
 Shytty lyrics followed by half decent beats and horrid vocal work = Freek Show. The only song that slightly interested me while listening to this trash was People Are Strange which is a DOORS cover. Wanna waste your money on immature lyrics.. Purchase this cd.. if not then go look else where..  Freek Show.. Hardly.. More like annoying. 
 i have read a number of dylan books. i found this one the most difficult to get into and appreciate. i tried to read it a couple of times but gave up. it seemed too complex and high-falluten [?sp].  maybe it's me. anyway, for what it's worth i truly loved CHIMES OF FREEDOM, DYLAN AND PHILOSOPHY AND CHRONICLES 1. GOD BLESS 
 Dissecting the Holocaust is just a new spin on anti-Semitism.  What's next, denying slavery in America, denying the Red Sox won the series in 2004.  Some call this a scholarly work, it is not scholarly, rather phony intellectualism, which is a pure lie 
 I do not wish to dissect this book line by line, nor to clarify for review readers where I stand on the issues presented in the book. (Other reviewers have done enough of that.) My only desire is to point out that the best writing in all genres makes the reader anxious for the end. This author uses such derisive, negative and dismissive language from the first line of the introduction that the fun of reading is just not there. Subtlety is the mother of good writing.    
 I have Lee as a professor right now. I thought it was interesting that she helped write the book, and then was going to teach with it. Well when we were assigned to read the first chapter the first class, I thought..how am I going to read the rest of this??! The way the book is set up, I can't even follow it. The terms are thrown in the middle of paragraphs, and it's difficult to follow along. I think it just seems like a lot of "babble" throught the whole thing. If things were set up better, I'm sure the ideas presented would be wonderful, but it's just difficult how it is 
 This DVD player worked for about 5 months then it read "no disc" and would not play. Technical support unhelpful, warranty only 90 days.  Tried to save some money going with this product - you get what you pay for.  I would recommend spending more and getting something with better quality. 
 After reading the first page of Spolin's first chapter I was intrigued. Several pages later, I was sound asleep. I attribute this to the fact that Viola Solin, when she's theorizing, writes like Immanuel Kant tripping on acid. This was especially discouraging, since I had just finished reading Audition by Michael Shurtleff, which is the most clearly written and insightful book on acting anyone could ever ask for.    	 Skimming the exercise descriptions, I found some of them tedious ("Play a salesman with only your calves!") and some of them risible ("Scream with your elbow!"). Also, her chapter on Emotion seems to contradict the entire Method acting tradition, which, thankfully, she is in no danger of overthrowing.   I'm sure that there are some useful points that this book makes, or might make through its exercises, if I cared to try them. But thanks to Spolin's soporific word-salad, her points are a pleasure to miss. 
 As a recent Econ Major from the University of Washington, I found the book outdated and inconsistent.  It had the nauseating sense of a political polemic dressed up as an "economic treatise."  I can only agree with a handful of his "realist" conclusions.    While reading Eat the Rich, I found the first few chapters on theory semi-humorous and the rest of the book dry, just like most economics texts.  Apparently the dismal science is humorless by definition.    As for Mr. O'Rourke's so called libertarian credentials, I would like to revoke them after reading this book and his romance pamphlet for the U.S. military (called Peace Kills).  Just because you are a member of the Cato institute, doesn't mean you are a consistent libertarian.  In fact, it probably makes you an inconsistent one.    Obviously I have more complaints, so I will save us both time and just relate one more.  Why would you seriously treat Albania as a capitalist country?  Then call it anarchist?  It seems that P.J. has a bit of an axe to grind here.  If he would have just looked at the Fraser institute's study on economic freedom - he would find Albania ranks number 91st in government regulation of business, 74th on protection of private property and 69th on the relative (taxed) size of government out of roughly a 100 countries.  Obviously Mr. O'Rourke hasn't done his research very well (or his empiricist radar was turned off) if I was able to do a similar analysis in a few moments without going to the country in question.  How can the 69th largest government be called "anarchist?"  I am truly puzzled.  (After looking at some of the recent historical data - I wonder if O'Rourke was asleep while writing this chapter.  I have been generous with my numbers for the former Communist country.)   All seriousness aside, I liked P.J.'s earlier stuff better, most notably "Parliament of Whores".   He is much funnier and seems to be more at home with politics.  Yet, from what I have seen, he is writing another book about economics - God spare us.  If you are truly interested in learning Economics - try Gene Callahan's "Economics for Real People." 
 This book is absolute garbage on the highest level. Anyone who writes a good review for this is either related to nelson or spends most of thier time in cage swingin from a tyre throwing thier own excrement at the wall, or, most likely, both 
 Buyer Beware.  This is not a story about Peter Duel.  If you want to see this book, find someone who has it and look first.  Do not spend money unless you want a comic book that has little to do with Mr. Duel, and a lot to do with the author.  If I could give it negative star rating, I would 
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 I heard him talk, this guy is an idiot. A conspiracy theory is al this is 
 This book attempts to offer a rebuttal to selective points argued in The Case for Christ. It is very hard to provide evidence for something that happened 2000 years ago. Try to prove that Socrates really existed, or try proving he didn't exist?   For example, if other historians at the time never mentioned Jesus, does that mean Jesus did not exist? No, it is impossible to DISPROVE Jesus just as it is impossible to completely prove Jesus existed. Saying the gospels are inconsistent and hard to believe is not proving Jesus didn't exist.   Can you prove who wrote the bible if the said authors didn't? Instead of trying to find inconsistencies in the gospels, can you prove, with evidence, Jesus never lived? If you can't prove with evidence that He didn't live, how do you expect someone to prove He did live?  The Case for Christ will make Christians happy. This book will make non-Christians happy. However, the book that actually talks with scholars themselves and gives them a chance to respond is The Case for Christ. 
 This is my first Ludlum book and it is sure to be my last.  The plot is preposterous because of Ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history.  Once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away.  It starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some "weapon" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars!  Hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania.  Some spoiled, rich American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history.  I know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest.  If you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department 
      Stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic. Not one single "fact" about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film I had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won. What a crock 
 This book talks about accounting in a limited way. Whereas it says that it aims to present accounting to the reader regardless of his/her background, the book certainly fails to do so. Organization of information is poorly  executed, and lack of depth and non-randomization of scenarios make the  readers' perspective quite limited 
 I've seen both versions and suggest skipping them both (along with Halloween 5) unless you just can't help yourself.  Pros for "The Curse of Michael Myers": better pacing; some of The Shape's (George Wilbur's) more intimidating moves are in the "new" ending which makes up the last 17 minutes of this version.   Pros for "The Producer's Cut": I personally enjoyed the "origin" of Michael Myers presented in this version (even though the movie was slow); although I felt really bad about Dr. Loomis' fate at the end, I enjoyed Michael's escape.   Neither origin really adds much to the story line and the end of the theatrical version is pathetic. At the end of The Producer's Cut you may wonder if Michael is off to continue his pranks or is done killing. Guess H20 answered that question...  Happy Hallowee 
 Clearly a beginner's text. Positive in that it does mention object-relational design. Can be read in a day but contents are not substantial enough in my opinion. Somewhat disappointed in Morgan Kaufmann for publishing this work. Teorey's volume I'd prefer 
 As a professional art historian who teaches twentieth century art at public university, I find this book to be virtually worthless. Not only do the authors leave out artists from their book because they don't adhere to their own rigid ideological orthodoxies, but the book is very badly written; they undermine their own arguments by constantly lapsing into semi-meaningless jargon. A good postmodernist/ Marxist perspective in a general introduction to twentieth century would be useful, but these authors are too inept and arrogant to bring it off 
 Coming off of the AMAZING "Sorry" remixes, this set of remixes from "Confessions on a Dance Floor" was sort of a letdown.  I listened to the maxi-CD once and that was enough- nothing too inspired here...  
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 It's sad when a commercial is superior to the movie, but the boogeyman is an example of that particular reality.  Even renting this film is a waste of time. Had they attempted to explain the entire thing with Tim being a schizophrenic who flipped out and killed everyone, but hallucinated the boogeyman doing it, then that would've probably saved the film, but it didn't end that way.  Tim is the typical screwed up, scared of the closet kid, only about twenty years too old, being traumatized by having seen his father get mangled in the closet by the boogeyman. After posing for the first twenty minutes as having rewritten this event into just a way of dealing with his father's leaving (not very convincing, by the way), he goes home after his mother's death and decides to face his old fears by spending a night in the house he grew up in. Then follows a group of messily edited, badly written, and confusing events that make no sense and are not even remotely explained.  For no apparent reason, he drags along for about an hour an old childhood friend named Kate, who conveniently keeps showing up with only flimsy contrived excuses.  She rides over to his house on a horse which for no reason throws her off; he has no food so she rides her bike late at night over to bring him some.  None of this would be that bad if it wasn't for the fact that the last fifteen minutes were a series of absurd events. His excessively touchy-feely girlfriend shows up, drives him to a motel, and vanishes. He goes into a closet and comes out in his old house's closet and jumps at Kate (there to give the gift of food). He goes and chats with a girl, who was following him around asking about the boogeyman who then was dead but still showing up, being a kind of spiritual advisor on destroying childhood demons. He goes into closets and appears in different buildings, sometimes under beds, gets pulled under beds and comes out closets, and something about nailing a chair in front of a closet and facing the boogeyman turns into him smashing and destroying everything in his old room as a means of destroying the boogeyman. It would have been all okay had it been the delusions of a madman, with his sudden appearances elsewhere being blackouts and flashes of memory. But no, it was supposed to be a real, non-CGI boogeyman. The result was a cheesy, boring, 90 minute film that should've ended way sooner, because even at a hour and a half, it went too long. It could've been good if it had just not tried to make the whole boogeyman thing a literal thing, but of course, they didn't. And what was that with his girlfriend? He walks through a closet and finds himself in the motel bathroom where she vanished, sees gray water pouring out of the faucet, then she pops out of the water a few times to be apparently drowned or at least repeatedly covered with splashing dirty water by some watery manifestation of, yes, the boogeyman. Then he goes to his room, with the ever present Kate, smashed a few toys, and everything was peachy.  I've watched horror movies since about the age of six, a good eleven years, from Nightmare on Elm St., to the Hammer films, to Dracula (about forty of them), to Evil Dead, and this one just sucks.  There are so many better horror movies to choose from. 
 For those of you who don't know, this ranks in the top 100 as one of the greatest selling albums of all time.  Right up there with Abbey Road and Dark Side Of The Moon!  There's a reason for this.  First let's all learn a new word today: commercialism  Webster's dictionary states that commercialism is the practice of exchanging or selling products between different individuals where each individual is trying to gain something they didn't have before at the expense of losing something they already had.  This does work one ways sometimes.  For example: In Britany Spears' case record consumers lose their money to Spears and Spears doesn't give anything back in exchange.  Or maybe she does?  She gives us images of her body which make inperfect looking girls feel like garbage.  She gives us paper from the linear notes which we could use to jot down notes on or use as napkins.  She gives us talentless images and sounds which make us thankful we have talents and vaules which she clearly lacks.  So why is this such a great selling album.  Because people are willing to buy the album and, as a result, get those great things I mentioned in the previous paragraph.  And there is a reason why those things are great.  Where would we be today without Spears' casual sex preferences encouraging young girls to have all the sex they want and thus come down with AIDS and God knows what else.  Where would we be without Spears' MTV videos encouraging us to sit around at home watching them while gaining weight from lack of exercise and eating doritos. All the while she stays fit because of her personal trainers and chefs that she got with our money.  And where would we be with out an idol to kiss the feet of and sacrafice animals to.  See, with out those great things we would be stuck in a world where people feel good about themselves, are highly motivated, and realise that you don't have to look perfect to be a good person.  Thank God we live in this world where everbody is unequal and there is a sharp divide between the rich and beautiful and those who aren't.  I don't think are favorite, lovable idol, Britney Spears', would be able to survive in the formerly mentioned world.  ......if you believed anything in that second paragraph then this album is for you!  As I said before I'm not forcing you to not buy this album, I am just giving reasons why I think its a poor product and is not recommended unless you really like commercialized bubblegum.  
 for non writers who manipulate everything to suit their conceptions.  the FACTS completely debunk this book.  Thankfully, these men will fade; the true mysteries remain unanswered waiting, perhaps, for someone without personal gain to cull through, define and present.  What a nasty book 
 I loved What The Bleep? And I specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day'.  This video teaches NOTHING about how to create your day - NOTHING.  It's just Ramtha (JZ Knight) talking about the fact that you can create your day.  I HEARD YOU IN THE MOVIE!  I bought this to give me some additional insights into HOW to create my day.  It does NOT teach any HOW whatsoever.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!  Buy "The Secret" @ TheSecret.tv.  Buy "The Attractor Factor" by Joe Vitale.  Buy "Wealth Beyond Reason" by Bob Doyle.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO 
 Why put a Blue and Gold Macaw as the cover of her book when the book clearly AVOIDS Macaws all together!  If you're a Macaw owner as I am, look for some other book! She fills pages with dribble about her precious African Grey "Sinbad" and of their personal experiences.  Why not  use her for the cover then instead of tricking Macaw owners with a hollow  promise.  The book has charts (p. 18-22) that are filled with opinion  represented as fact.  The photos indicate that the author is fond of cheap  as most of the cages portrayed are offensively so. She even recommends that  Birds be allowed to play with Screws and Bolts for toys. And to add insult to the injustice done  to Macaws, there on the back cover is .... a Macaw.  False advertisement  lady! The books only answer to the posed question "Why does my bird do  that?" is that it's suppose to.  I would expect a work such as this to  be authored by a former Wal-mart pet department employee and not the former  editor of Bird Talk. Because, not only is the material non-authorive, she  can't keep her pen on one subject for more than five sentences before  changing topic 
 Wonderful prose -- use of language 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 Jennifer Jason...Can someone PUHLeeze tell me why she ALWAYS plays the same role! ANd why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution!The so called ~Bostonish...or upper crust--east coast accent does Not include..slurring your words as if a consonant was too much WORK.  It as if her upper lip is never engaged at all..Not even to smirk!  Does she have a BOTOX complex..USE YOUR FACE..Including your upper lip... But then again...Maybe she was acting JUST like Dorothy Parker..WHo ahem..happens to be dead..!  ( no disrespect intended..)  Jennifer Beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance..WHY didn't she play Parker..I believed her character!  Gwyneth..Love her..!  Bit part..but she added a much needed warmth to the film..  I cared for one character..And the best part was his bit giving a financial report..I thought that was BRILLIANT..! BRavo..But Mr. Benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character..THANK YOU..  WIll someone Please make this film over..And Do it right..!  And don't just call up your buds..for a tupperware party and say..HEY..Lets make a movie..!  Dorothy Parker deserves MUCH MUCH better..I can't EVEN imagine the biting remarks she would print..How about..  'It's all about me..And I hated it..!But the costumes were nice.. 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 First of all this is a review that will help adults and young adults out the most, because younger kids who like horrors frequently enjoy horrors such as this one or the Grudge or the Ring. Now to the older people, this movie sucks it is one of the worst horrors I have ever seen. So I love horrors and I have seen a lot including the pg13 ones such as the Grudge and the Ring. Those two were descent back in the day but when comparing Pulse to them they look like the scariest movies ever. I have to admit there was only one scary part in this movie, but I wont give it away. It was also really annoying that the whole movie was in a blue tint so it was hard to get past that. And if you think that just because it is unrated that there will be blood and gore and extreme violence, YOURE WRONG. For those who love gorefest movies this isnt it, I know the front cover kind of looks that way but it isnt. I dont recall one scene of blood, the enemy was a virus through a computer and the acting was horrible. There was also the brilliant idea to add some humor into this movie, they said that this virus could get through any thing electronic so they covered everything in red duct tape to keep them from getting through, HAHAHAHHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I beg who ever is reading this to not even rent this movie, it sucks, I made the worst mistake by buying this movi 
 You know, it's too bad these reviews can't be weighted because there's a class of about 40 people with whom I took accounting in university that would trash this book. Make it 41 for the prof who stepped in and had to use it. It is not well written, with information presented out of logical order. It does not cover the materials sufficiently, nor in enough depth, trying to combine financial and managerial accounting in a book full of "worksheet" style pages that could have, and should have, been cheaply produced in an accompanying study or homework guide instead of built into a hard cover book that doesn't even have a lot of content to begin with. It's a waste of money at just about any price, not being able to teach the material, never mind at its outrageous price. I wish we could sue to get our money back on books that simply don't live up to standards. I also wish there was a zero star rating, or negative ones, which indicate complete waste of time and/or money, never mind zero value to purchase and read 
 This book was not written by Hayek. It was written by editor and confidant W.W. Bartley when Hayek was sick and incapacitated. The only parts written by Hayek were just random notes that only show up in the appendices 
 This is DFW show-off opus, where he uses verbosity to club the reader over the head until they are senseless and *think* they really understand what he's talking about.  I wonder if this whole work is a cruel joke; to see if we "get it".  This is a book to tackle (and I mean that word) when you're stranded on a desert island with no other choices.  Otherwise pick up one of his collections of non-fiction 
 While the book is supposed to focus on synaesthesia, it seems more to focus on Cytowic's views on the medical profession.  In addition to the ridiculus interactions between people, he cuts down most people and finds a  way to make himself seem intelligent and profound.  When Cytowic did  actually talk about synaesthesia it was clearly written and very  interesting.  Perhaps there wasn't enough to write about synaesthesia.  Who  knows.. 
 While this product look nice, you would have to put up with holding the rod(s) in place as you open the curtains or risk having them break apart where they join. It's not going to give you a concussion when the rod hits your head but it gets really annoying having to "thread" the curtain through again every time this happens. There are no screws to tighten at the ends. I have contacted Umbra twice already about this - once by phone where I actually got a live person, the other by email. Neither produced any response. They did not even attempt to remedy this problem...NOTHING (nice going, Umbra). I guess they want you to spend more money on their double rod drapery brackets (search "Umbra Double Drapery Rod Bracket" on amazon.com) which render the curly brackets useless - the same curly brackets whose cost have already been factored in the purchase price of the Serif Drapery Double Rod Set. 
 ,,, instead of dispassionate, reasoned argument. Faludi interprets everything, *everything*, as proof of her argument that a "war" has been declared against women. There are no shades of grey, and no counterarguments in Faludi's book. This makes me wonder just how carefully she did her research; assumning she dug deeply enough, did she just disregard anything that didn't tend to support her point of view? I have worked hard to get a JD and an MBA, and if that education has given me only one great lesson, it's that you cannot ignore real contrary evidence (and it's always out there); you might not like it, but you must address it.  I'm a woman in my 50s, and I believe that, with friends like Faludi, women don't need enemies. If ever a man described women as inferior to men in terms of capacity for reasoned argument, all he'd need to do to prove his point is refer to Faludi's screed.   Faludi's book is geared to the sheep among women and the ignorant among young girls. Academics are bound to eat it up, unfortunately; particularly those poor disenfranchised tenured female professors.   
 If you are interested in learning about the *actual* science of food, but don't want to learn any science, at least read a book by someone who *did* learn it.  There is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely.  "Oil is more dense than water-- and that's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212".  As a chemist and formulator I can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water, and even if it weren't that's *not* the reason it has a higher boiling point.  Ever make oil & vinegar salad dressing?  Ever seen crude oil on the ocean?  How about the funk on top of old greasy dish water?  Folks, oil floats on water... and the earth is not flat.  Either this guy is a complete moron, or he is a very clever con artist.  Either way, save your money... and buy that blind Amish author's book "Semiconductor Microengineering for Dummies" instead.  It's better researched 
 I don't often write reviews, but I thought this book deserves one. Having read over 10 of the books from the American President Series, this is the weak link. I was skeptical by a book authored by Gary Hart, but I trusted the series since all the other books were solid works. Hart quotes Henry Ammon so much that you may as well read Ammon's book on James Monroe, published only 15 years prior to this. Hart also repeats himself often. Although this is a minor complaint, the chapters could use some subdivisions. Again, if you are looking for a good biography on James Monroe, you'll probably want to read Henry Ammon's version. 
 Snore.  I too have loved and read the others in this series.  This one bored me to death.  I agree with most of the negative comments here.  I was happy that Harry and Fair got married again, but with the emotional tension between the two of them gone, something is missing.  I missed Maranda, too, who only appeared briefly at the end. I loved her bible-quoting moments and the descriptions of her yummy baked goods.  I think it was a mistake to have Harry leave the post office.  Gone are the wonderful cameo appearances from minor characters throughout the book. With the shocking knowedge that Mrs. Murphy has not been spayed, are we going to see little Murphies running about?    Well, every good writer -- and Rita Mae Brown is indeed a good writer -- is entitled to one bad book now and then.  Hope this is the last bad one in this series 
 This is an early work by a transsexual person but I did not enjoy it. Ms. Morris of course knows how to use the English language in an elegant manner but the book still failed for me. She treats women as nothing more than a shadow of men. Her book thinks it is perfectly acceptable for women to be sexually harrassed by men. She accepts sex role stereotypes pertaining to men and women. This book would not be  helpful to modern day transgendered youth. 
 I admit that I have read every single one of Lilian Jackson Braun's "Cat Who" books. I used to relish every single one, but I agree with the other reviewers: Lately the books have been getting lamer and lamer.  I, too, think the books are now being ghost-written by someone else. I think the ghost-writing began about five or six books ago. It's not just that the mystery, never central, is now utterly an afterthought in these books. Nor is it that the resolution relies not on accute detective work on the part of Qwilleran or KoKo, but on deus ex machina. (Qwill and KoKo used to really sniff around, so to speak.) Nor is it that the style is mucher coyer than what Ms. Jackson Braun used to use. (I've had it with the endless references to the salt-and-pepper mustache already! It's getting to be a parody of itself!) No, the clincher is the many errors and inconsistencies in "The Cat Who Talked Turkey."   Someone has already pointed out that the Siamese take a car trip in perfect harmony in "The Cat Who Talked Turkey." We all remember that Yum-Yum howls whenever she's in the car. And what happened to taking KoKo out on the leash? And the last time we were privy to the love life of Gary Pratt, owner of the Black Bear Cafe, he was mourning a dead girlfriend. When did he pick up the wife who plays such a big role in this book?  The ghost writer not only hasn't read all the "Cat Who" books, s/he hasn't even done much research. In the book, Qwilleran wonders how KoKo could know something if he can't read. But the very first book posits that KoKo can read backwards. Remember the title of the very first book in this series? The ghost writer clearly doesn't!  Also, Eddington Smith's great-grandfather or grandfather is described as a pirate. But, in the original story, wasn't he a highwayman, instead?  The change in tone comes in the very first sentence when there's a quote from the "Qwill Pen": "A town without a bookstore is like a chicken with one leg." Now, the "Qwill Pen," while not exactly Art Buchwald, has never been this ridiculous.  I've been a faithful reader until now, but this book is the last straw. I suspect that there's not one ghost writer, but more than one, and that's why the books aren't just inconsistent with the real "Cat Who" books, but they don't really match each other, either. I hate to say it, but I'm finished with this series 
 Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working.   Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.  I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution 
 This book was perfectly awful. If it was possible I would have givin it zero stars. I am in the eighth grade and none of the people in my school act like this.  People might be thinking this but don't actually say it out loud.  This book was also degrading towards both boys and girls.  The one charactor in this book who I actually liked was Marcaline.  I don't recomend this book for people of of any age and anyone under 15 should absolutly not read it!  Save yourself the time and put this book where it belongs.  In the trash can 
 it is a long listing of all things you can collect from harry potter.  While i enjoy the HP series, I had no idea that this book would be SO boring.  I don't care what all i can collect, I wanted background and comparisons.  Yuck 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 Paul Russell can be a brilliant writer -- see A Coming Storm -- but you would hardly know that from this book. There is way too much pop-psychology "insight" into the characters, coming both from the narrator and from the characters themselves, who seem to be constantly musing about themselves and the other characters.  There is an underlying current here, that Paul Russell obviously feels will hold the reader's interest, and that is the infatuating allure of youth, personified here by the character Leigh. But, really, in this book and maybe in life, that just isn't enough to hold your interest for a long period.  This is just a slow motion melo-drama with lots of emotional molehills fashioned into tedious mountains. The interwoven relationships and obsessions and sore points are all just too much, hardly credible, and rarely interesting. Also, some of the main elements of the book, such as the flamboyant hairdresser, or the mercurial immature teenager, are just clunking cliches.  Skip this one 
 Using MRI and neuroscience to try to answer questions about dyslexia as Sally Md Shaywitz has tried to do is dangerously short sighted and terribly misguided.  Especially when you consider that her conclusions about remediation reflect what is so deeply wrong with education today.  Trying to cram human brain function and the human spirit into the confines of modern education  is akin to stuffing an elephant into a thimble. Imagine if one were so dimwitted as to blame the elephant for the obvious lack of success.  This is precisely what is happening today in public education.  If one were able to step back from the tree and catch a glimpse of the forest, one might see that ego drives professionals to draw conclusions about student performance that reflect the stupidity of arrogance.  More and more students are being labeled learning disabled and dyslexic, more medication is being doled out and more and more remediations are being invented to control and force students into a useless development that does much more to impede brain function than to enhance it.  In fact, students are being driven into intellectual comas and instead of rethinking methods and curriculum, teachers blame students and their families for their own professional shortcomings. Uniforms, drill and kill, direct instruction amongst other inhumane and unintelligent strategies are exactly what has gotten us to this desperate point.  In one more generation, Sally Md Shaywitz will be able to prove that 2 in 5 students have dyslexia and her confidence in modern science will soar to new heights.  Teachers everywhere will be able to rejoice that their own drastic failings are not their fault at all, but that of the flawed human condition.   Read Thomas Khun's Scientific Revolutions to understand the mechanics behind what I am about to describe.  The present paradigm of public education is precisely the reason why we have today's educational dilemma. (crisis). Modern public education is metaphorically lost in Minos' maze.  We have lost our way and we also lost  Ariadne's golden cord. Almost all educational research and conclusions drawn from research are hopelessly lost in the labyrinth.  All of our attempts to extricate ourselves, including  taking advice from Sally Md Shaywitz, forces us deeper into the maze and closer to our inevitable demise at the horns of the minotaur.   We are in a quagmire of  a dismally intellectually bankrupt system of labels and useless judgments that serve little more than to take us all to our lowest common denominator.    There is a new paradigm, when it is presented, war will be officially declared.  The entire teaching profession will be turned on its head and will rally all its base resources to wage war on the new paradigm.  It will be revolted by the new paradigm because it calls for many new definitions. What is education? What does it mean to learn?  What is the nature of a professional teacher? What is the role of public education?   It will call for the new teacher to be a humble public servant rather than an arrogant dispenser of knowledge. Although the new paradigm may be new to the public, it began as long as 3000 years ago and its adoption is inevitable.  The only question will be when and after how much suffering?   If I am correct, then Sally Md Shaywitz and people like her have done much to damage the development of our populace.  We will continue to help them in their madness because we too are ignorant of the reality of the situation.   We are in the infancy of our intellectual development.  To assume otherwise is the epitome of stupidity. I am disgusted by the vacuous conclusions that we allow ourselves to believe about data especially about direct explicit instruction, Albert Einstein said "what can be measured doesn't always count and what counts can not always be measured."  The profession of teaching lacks development and insight on a monumental scale.   I would appreciate any intelligent refutation of my above statement. I would love to hear something intelligent about Sally Md Shaywitz's work and her conclusions that open my eyes to any possible benefit to heeding her advice.   I myself have no credentials compared to her Yale position, but as Mark Twain said, "It is better to deserve an honor and not get it than to get it and not deserve it.  Please feel free to correct my thinking at [...]Sincerely Ty   
 This rates as one of the poorer mysteries I have read in years.  It was truly an ordeal to finish, and I am left wondering why I bothered.  It has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters, many of whom are  stereotypical creations of little or no interest.  I was particularly  amused when the detective was told to "make a few inquiries at the  transsexual shoe shop, giving the size and style of the shoe from the  corpse".  In all of LA, I am sure there is just one known  "transsexual shoe shop".  Please.  I suspect Ms. LaPlante has  better material, but this is a poor example better left unread.  I would  give it less than one star, but unfortunately that's not an option 
 I gave this version of this excellent play two stars solely for the quality of the staging but this film is SLOW. While it is well acted, with excellent cinematography and set design, the director has done a very poor job because it drags and drags and lacks any of the crispness of the original.  In fact I didn't even finish watching it.  Close and Stewart played Henry and Eleanor as truly estranged enemies who were sincerely plotting each other's destruction.  This may have been closer to the historical truth (but who really knows?)but it simply wasn't fun or interesting.  The play rests entirely on the repartee between Eleanor and Henry and the rapier wit of the two but alas this was missing in this version.  The entire film was stagey and filled with pregnant pauses which killed the pace and wit.  The Hepburn O'Toole version is much better because it is filmed in a more intimate way plus Hepburn and O'Toole play the characters as truly loving each other but people who cannot stop being King and Queen with totally different agendas.  The Lion2 was a big disappointment 
 This book is terrible. That lady gets into itty bitty details that would make you look like the biggest snob.  I was looking for a broad range of common personal/business situations where proper etiquette is not obvious.  SAVE YOUR MONEY and let me know where you find that "great book on  etiquette" because I'm still looking 
 Mabe because he's of the bloodlines.And all this grail runneth over(WITH BLOOD)talk;code for the fact that mabe he imbibes the stuff himself.Do a Google search on this guy,and you'll see articles by David Icke and others,accusing him of being a full on REPTILIAN SHAPE SHIFTER,who practices satanic rituals.When these guys talk Jesus,they mean Lucifer.and mabe much of this fantasy dis-info he spews out,is in fact the truth.Queen EL Lizzard Birth the 2nd dosen't Knight folks unless she deems them important,and wants to reward them for being good little satanists,& doing their part in bringing about the new world order.Mabe all these tomes he's written are ushering in the Destruction of all Jesus based western religon,or the dawning of the antichrist(Prince William,who's middle name is Arthur.And pretty soon we might have a new King Arthur in our midst.And what was Arthurs life long quest?To Find The HOLY GRAIL!-NEWS-FLASH.It's 05/24/05,and as i write this "Sir" Laurence is talking live on the Jeff Rense computer radio show.And talking and talking;and in nervous tones i might add.I also see that he's dropped the "Sir"moniker from his name,to distance him self(at least as far as the public is concerned)from QE2 and the House of Windsor(Who he truly serves).What i find most revealing is absolutely no mention or catagoric "REFUTATION" of The above accusation:I.E.His being a shape shifting reptillian.At least you'd expect a passing joking comment upon it.But NAY!!!Dosen't he know that any one listening can crack a google search by inputing his name,and ten or so down,FIND said accusation.You can hear in Jeff Rense's voice cautious concern,but so far he is allowing LG to save face(Ya sure as hell know that Jeff Rense has read the story).LG is talking as i said before in a nervous "mile a minute" manner,knowing full well that this secret of his,is all over the internet.And thank god for the WEB,the last refuge for free speech and truth.He seems like a mild mannered affable sort of chap.But don't be sucked in,all these elite folks(Espically World leaders)lead double lives and use "warm and fuzzy" fronts and cloaks.Oh i'm sorry didn't you know that the vast majority of the worlds leaders,and power elite are SATANISTS!!!And have always been.WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!!! 
 if you're lookin for the bangin hip hop tracks you heard in the movie, you'll be disappointed with this soundtrack.  fatman scoop and dmx are both missing from the soundtrack and they both have tight songs in the movie.  unless you love listening to another b2k album then this cd SUCKS 
 This may be one of the most unsatisfying books I have read, which is a disappointment because I have enjoyed a couple of other Capote books, written before he succumbed to his own excesses and ego. This is so disjointed and lightweight that parts of it had me sighing in disgust, rueing the waste of a great talent. Capote seems to wear his crassness as a badge of honour, and while there is certainly nothing wrong with being proudly gay or even proudly wierd, he flaunts his strangeness in a way that becomes less endearing and more towards the annoying. It strikes me that Capote would have been a very frustrating person to know in real life - aloof and supremely selfish, a state most likely exacerbated by his addictions. The foreword to this "novel", written by its editor, hints at how difficult Capote was to deal with. Those points aside, all would have been forgiven if this had been a coherent, or at least interesting, piece of work. I found it self-indulgent, lazy and pretty much a waste of time. Its only value is perhaps as a cautionary tale for those who feel like wasting their talent. 
 Dated, biased account of what happened at PARC and at Xerox headquarters. Very out of date, especially given PARC's foresight in terms of  distributed, connected computers. It seems like the authors decided to bash  Xerox even before they began their research. Save your money on this one. A  better bet is "Dealers of Lightning" by Michael Hiltzik. That one  points out what Xerox did wrong, and, oh, by the way, what they did right.  (For example, make a couple of billion dollars out of the Laser Print  industry.) The authors of this one just seemed to have it "in"  for Xerox. I wonder if they used a windows based PC or Mac to type the  original manuscript? Not without PARC, they wouldn't have 
 This was a complete disappointment. They reduced the size of the book from 8 ½" by 11" to 7" by 10". This in itself is not so bad, but they reduced all the information in this book as well. They no longer cover any antique toys at best they only deal in vintage / classic toys. If your ideas of antique toy cars are Red Line Hotwheels you will like this book. If you are looking for Aircraft, American Paper Toys, Animal Drawn, Banks, Dollhouses and Miniature Furniture, Erector Sets, Farm Toys, Lionel Trains, Movie, Radio & Television Toys, Ramp Walkers, Schoenhut, Ships, Soldiers, Sparklers and Plunger Toys, Steam Toys, Wooden Toys, Cast Iron Vehicles and anything else before the 60's forget it! This has been reduced to nothing more than a baby boomer's toy guide. If you enjoy Antique Toy World, this book is not for you! If you like Toy Shop Magazine, well that is all this is. If you own the 11th Edition of Collecting Toys, hold on to it and get a second copy before you waste your money on this dreadful price guide. 
 This is a relatively straightforward propaganda melodrama, with nothing particularly compelling to recommend it, but for one notable exception.  Bertold Brecht's villains and miscreants are all so full of gusto. They share kinship with the ones in Threepenny Opera and Mahagonny after all. It seems Brecht could not create a scoundrel he couldn't admire on a certain, mischievous level. The ones in this film are no exception, and lift it out of the "ordinary" into the realm of the "oddity" 
 Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through.  Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.'  This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread.  I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger.  I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction.  And the afterword by the author seemed smug.  I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never 
 It may be good for a university classroom, but I don't think this book works well on its own.  It lacks the details that would really make clear the significance of the people and events and leave them in the memory.  I was even bored by the section on the Cultural Revolution!  But I did learn a fair bit nonetheless 
 Icky, ick, ick.  This diet book has absolutely no scientifically proven nutritional info to back it up.  It is a fad diet through and through and was so successful because it got tons of publicity and the public is so clueless about nutrition and so overweight that they will listen to anything for help.  However, this book is lacking in so many ways.  Agatston is probably as clueless about nutrition as you are if you are looking into purchasing this book.  Take a look at healthy 100 by John Robbins or Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, M.D.  If you do read either of those books, you will understand why I am proclaiming this.  I am also a nutritionist who has a broad background on nutrition.  If you buy this book you will not be following the best diet for your body and may suffer some health consequences.  Joel Fuhrman, M.D. is a medical doctor who specializes in nutrition.  He has helped people to not only loose weight but helped people to get ride of health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, lupus, migraines, and myraid other health aliments, even cancer.  I had a medical appointment with Dr. Fuhrman once and I could not respect the guy more.  He is a nice person who truly cares about your well being and health.  I have not met John Robbins, but in his book he also comes off as genuine and caring.  I cannot say that about Agatston.  
 Sloppily written tale of an orphan who grows up to befriend pirates,shrinks and vampires is annoyingly structured with virtually no plot.It had potential but it feels like a bunch of ideas lazily tossed together.The blending of different elements from pirates to vampires drew me to buy this book but pardon the ovious pun...this semi-vampire buddy novel really Sucks 
 A collection of the author's personal prejudices dressed up as trendy boogey-men. Vapid writing filled with out-of-context references used to reinforce her prejudices. Save your money if you're looking for any serious information or approaches to understanding social deviance 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 OMG! This movie sucked. The movie had no point and the plot was horrible. The characters were so cheesy. I can't believe I watched it to the end because the ending was very disappointing. There was absolutely no moral, no point, no issue at hand, no overtones whatsoever. The movie was sooopoorly directed. I have no opinion about the original, but the revised version is horrible! It's so bad, I don't want to even give it 1 star, but I had to in order to rate it. Don't waste your time with this pitifully written and directed movie 
 music from and for crackheads..why would anyone listen to this garbage?? 
 This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this one 
 If "Havoc" was Anne Hathaway's "all grown-up" vehicle, she needs to check the engine.  Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the "PLC" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the "gangsta" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive "Rocca" wear and and "FUBU" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.  In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.  Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's "Malibu's Most Wanted" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the "PLC" without flinching.  Secondly, had four "innocent" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the "PLC" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.  Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, "Havoc" is a dud.  Unbelievable, uneventful and definitely a rental 
 I think this book is made up of a bunch of baloney.  I don't believe a word of it.  I think that way too much importance is placed on sex, to the point of being obsessed with it. It's about a bunch perverts, in my opinion.  The author's interest and obsession with sex is not normal.  It appears she thinks of nothing else in life, except sex, and who to have it with 
 I was hoping for a beginning lesson on grooming my dog - just the basics.  This is more styling and tips, for those who are already using grooming tools and know what to do.  This would be useful for someone wanting to improve their grooming skills, but not very useful for a beginner 
 This DVD is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show.  For a "best of" volume, I expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the DVD case advertises, namely "the best of" and the "scariest moments."  In my opinion, this volume fails to deliver what it promises.  I am definitely a fan of the series, and I know there are much better moments it has to offer.  About the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this DVD are some fairly decent examples of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon).  Even though the DVD is fairly inexpensive, I don't think it's worth the cost 
 The book is easy to read and moderately informative but useless as a textbook for a course in critical thinking. About a third of it is just incomprehensible because of the "folksy" writing style. Ex: Ch 4 opens, "Reasoning is often taken to be the hallmark of the human species. Colloquially, reasoning tells us 'what follows what.'" That's the best definition of reasoning you're going to get in that chapter! Errors of reasoning are rampant throughout the book. The first chapter opens with a barrage of statistics to show that CT is not adequately taught.Ex: You will live into your '70's so what do you need to know to be prosperous (as if all knowledge for the entire future needs to be acquired today.) The book is riddled with wrong definitions and erroneous information. The chapter on hypothesis testing is especially egregious in that regard. There are few references later than 1991 (in the 3d edition). Finally, the chapters do not speak to each other: There are completely unrelated chapters on memory, logic, and probability theory, for example. The book might be useful in a course on rhetoric or communications, but critical thinking it is not. The chapter on analysis of arguments is the one good one, but it doesn't redeem this... paperback 
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 I recently purchased this gate, as I needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide. I was so happy when I found this, and for the price! Well, I installed it with no problem at all. But it is not secure. It actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it, the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break. AWFUL and very unsafe!!!  Target.com was very helpful in sending UPS to pick it up. 
 Bought this despite mixed reviews from previous customers. As mentioned by others it gains approximately 3-4 min in a week. Also the Indiglo display isnt that great. It is very hard to see the time display during the day. Bottomline.. Always look through customer reviews and think hard and long if a product you are considering buying has bad reviews.  Update: Display is all messed up after just one battery change. Stay away from this produc 
 Judy Wardell wrote one of the very best, and first, non-diet books for achieving desired weight loss - "Thin Within". Then she got married. I can only blame her husband for converting an imaginative, insightful writer into a Bible-beating fundamentalist who quotes scripture in every paragraph 
 I purchased this book because of the very positive reviews.  After reading the book I was quite disappointed.  The very positive reviews were not accurate.  This is not a four or five star book.  Its marginally adequate, nothing more.  The information is very generic; narrow in scope, with no great insights.  In addition to being informationally weak, I felt the author was subtly pushing several internet poker sites.  Parts of the book read more like an infomercial than an unbiased informational book.  Upon finishing the book, I was left feeling disappointed.  The book did not deliver.  As an alternative selection, I highly recommend "Winning at Internet Poker for Dummies".  Although I find the title "for Dummies" offensive, the book is excellent, offering indepth, thorough discussions of the various topics involved with internet poker.   
 "24 Days" is both a story about what went on at Enron and how the Wall Street Journal reporters followed and wrote the story. The book is interesting at first, but after awhile the detail becomes overwhelming and pointless.   In addition, the book did not provide a clear understanding about CFO Fastow's side deals. To be fair, however, the deals were so complex that even with printed documentation in hand it was not possible to decipher what was going on, and other books on the topic have not clarified the matter either. What is clear, however, is that the side deals were kept under the radar as much as possible, and even deliberately hidden in some instances.   Another clear conclusion is that neither CEO Lay, former CEO Skilling, Enron's Board, nor numerous highly-paid stock analysts knew the full details or even tried. No evidence of their interest in any details was revealed. Incredible incompetence - at bes 
 Nazi's secretly in LA with a blimp and a whole army?  This guy has a jet pack that shoots fire out of it, but it never burns him; it burns other things though. Totally stupid and wierd. There is this super tall guy who is like soooo strong he bends people in half. Jetpacked Germans taking over USA. Give me a break. 
 If there was an option for 0 stars, this book would definitely deserve it. The two fellows who wrote this book are scammers. Please do not buy this book unless you want to waste your money. If you use any concept from here, you will make every girl run for the hills because there will be no attraction. 
 Sold as new.  Seller offered to refund or replace, but requested the item be returned in the original box, which I don't have anymore.  Also, seller charges a 15% restocking fee...on a non-functional return they will likely refurbish and re-sell!  After time and money spent shipping and the restocking fee, not worth the bother.  A great policy for the SELLER 
 There are two different ways in which this book may be rated: firstly, from the perspective of its contents, ideas, and accuracy - secondly, from the perspective of being an interesting read. On both accounts, the books scores one star at best.    As far as content is concerned, the main idea of this book revolves around the frustration the author has carried from her teenage years into adulthood in terms of her lack of financial resources to have what other teenagers had. Throughout the first chapters, the author vomits her anger for not being able to have and wear the labels her cool friends had and wore. This can only be described as resentment - she was not making a choice; rather, she could not access what she wanted. The rest of the book is dedicated to criticizing what marketing does, which is undertanding the needs and wants of consumers. From this perspective, we may also argue that businesses are trying to satisfy a demand, and that consumers are willing to pay a premium for having such demands met. However, the author pushes a left-wind agenda and interprets such a marketing approach as "exploiting" consumers. From then on, the books delves into a never ending tirade.    The second perspective this books may be analysed from is one of entertaining value. The books also scores a "fail" - in the pursuit of relent criticism, the topics are analysed in a very boring fashion.    Prospective readers trying to read some sensasionalistic, tabloid-style discourse are better served by getting Noami Klein, of Germaine Greer, or any other left-wing, socialist writer - at least, those authors write more stylish and fashionable nonsensical garbage.    
 _Fateful Triangle_ by Noam Chomsky with a foreward by Edward Said is a long rambling screed detailing the Mideast conflict from a point of view that is 100% pro Palestinian and anti American.  Upon reading this book, several things become immediately clear to the reader - Chomsky is a socialist with sympathy for the Soviet Union and Chomsky unequivocally supports the United Nations.  As an ideologue of the "New Left", Chomsky allows himself to indulge in abstruse argumentation and moral equivalences attempting to equate the United States with the Soviet Union, the terrorist PLO with Israel.  Chomsky is morally opposed to all war, the spread of communism does not particularly bother him, despite his occassional barb at "Stalinism" (seemingly provoked more out of jealousy than any genuine repulsion towards it).  In the past, Chomsky has made several outlandish statements, including announcing his support for the murderous Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia (a black mark that has proven particularly difficult for his "New Left" followers to eradicate).  As a supporter of the United Nations, Chomsky hopes for a day when the United States will completely abandon its national sovereignity to the collective wills of Third World dictators and communist nations.  Chomsky believes that Zionism is a continuation of "colonialism" (something that has become very trendy to decry, among the "New Left" "intellectual" elite) and therefore unequivocally supports the Palestinian identity.  This is particularly ironic given the fact that Chomsky himself is a Jew with specific links to the Jewish elite within the United States who himself lived for a time in a kibbutz within Israel.  The book itself seems at times more an exercise in intellectual onanism than anything else.  Newspaper clippings are cited out of order, historical events are decontextualized, obscure arguments and apparent moral equivalences are made.  At times Chomsky seems more disturbed by the failure of his own anti-war cronies on the far Left (such as Jane Fonda or Alan Dershowitz) to adopt his particular point of view with regard to the Mideast conflict.  Certainly nothing even approximating a genuine look at the political situation is attempted here.  Since this book was written, the United States remains just as entangled in the Mideast situation as ever.  Certainly such a situation is disturbing for those who recall the warnings of the American Founding Fathers to avoid foreign entanglements.  In the meantime, both Israelis and Palestinians continue to murder each other.  Whether or not someday this situation may heat up so as to start the Third World War remains to be seen.  We can only pray that such a course of events do not come about 
 Teaching children to read beyond the words is an important pedagogy, but one must consider the level of cognition of the audience.  Trites uses young adult and childrens' literature to highlight her points.  But her  analagies and metaphors are leaps and bounds beyond the realm of  understanding of youth.  In fact, many of her examples are difficult for  graduate students to comprehend.  Only a few analogies are comprehensible  to a youthful audience.  She is a genius at literary analysis, but she  needs to consider an age appropriate curriculum.  I will not refer to this  text in the future, nor will I recommend it to others 
 Alan Deutschman writes in quintessential GQ style...Apple, Pixar, Next and Jobs are given the cinematic attention - Brioni suits and designer clothing take precedence to the story telling theme! That's precisely where the story ends - Neither Apple's business environment nor the facts behind Jobs renaissance garner attention! Steve's vendetta against the Apple board that sacked him, his bitterness about moving away from the company he helped create and his pre-occupation with Odwalla fruit juices/Black polo shirt & blue jeans are the only facets of Steve's character that Deutschman manages to grasp. (...) Steve's obsession with German design aesthetics, his "tomfoolery" with his corporate hobbies- Next, Pixar and Apple are all touted by Deuschman as tenets of a precipitous corporate personality! Jobs is portayed as a whip slashing mogul who just rides his "ill-deserved" luck to the top- He is credited with ZERO intelligence and a disgusting atttitude! Apparently, Next and Pixar had no strategies and were "bleeding,hemorrhaging corporations"- a phrase Deutschman uses with irritating regularity!  Job's groundbreaking strategies to rev up the motorcade of new products at Apple and Next are promptly thrown out of the window! His ability to turn small-door companies like Pixar into money making machines is rudely ignored. (...)This man hardly knows what he is talking about 
 I bought this book to learn to improve my storytelling skills but all I got was a book about jesus and god where I can't relate to at all. Every sentence of this book is about God and priests. Now I can see how storytelling could be a good thing for priests to learn, but in that case the book should still be objective and maybe at the end have a special chapter how this can be used for priest, but instead this is a book only for priests and fanatics which you can maybe translate into other uses.  So sure, if you are not a priest you may still be able to use this if you put extra much effort to think how this can be used in other ways than just telling the bible, but I would rather recommend you to get a real book written by someone how takes his time to think about the answer of the stuff he writes about instead of just saying it's gods will 
  FYI, this guy is not a real Indian-he is a white man pretending.  That's been proven by DNA. And he was never a member of a tribe, it was "honorary" and was taken away.  The AIM movement came out and said they don't want him speaking for them, that he's a "wanabee" and that they don't like his racism. If you don't believe me, go to their website.  They have a whole section on him and others like him.  That kind of make me not want to read anymore of his books.  I full believe that what was done to the Indians was very wrong, but I'd like to hear about it from a genuine source-like an actual Indian historian, not some fake who apparently hates his own race.  This is not a "victims" perspective at all.  He's not the victim 
 This is the only textbook we used for our OS class at university. My interests lie in systems programming and some low-level interfacing using high level languages but this book really didn't help me much. I was looking forward to this subject but disappointed because the lecturer basically took this book as the bible and made no references to other sources. If this book was to create a religion and my lecturer was the pope then I wouldn't be surprised if there were so many factions like in Christianity...because of the confusing presentation of the subject. Half of the time I was consulting Google because of the nearly useless examples in the book. At one point I was arguing about a vaguely explained topic with my lecturer. I was using other texts as my references but unfortunately my lecturer was pushing his own interpretation of the topic 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 My kids really liked it until it broke the next day. There was nothing we could do to fix it as it had an electronic problem 
 We've owned this toaster for 2 years now.  Because it's lasted that long and due to it's appealing looks, we give it the 2 stars.  As for using it for toasting, it rates very poorly.  The toast darkness control is unreliable.  Leave it in one place and get light toast at one time and dark the next.  It has a silly mechanism that supposedly allows for better control when toasting bagels or muffins.  The control is useless.  The worst part of the machine, however, is that it is nearly impossible to retrieve the toast, bagel, whatever, without getting burned.  More than once we've been forced to turn the toaster upside down to get our breakfast (toast and millions of crumbs).  Buy it for it's looks, look elsewhere for making toast.  
 If you already have the yellow book "Questions and Answers to help you past the Real Estate Appraisal Exams", don't waste your money purchasing the new book that was put out in 2000. It's the same book - just copy written in October of 2000. I made the mistake of thinking that there would be new questions since 1994, or the questions would at least be asked in a different format, but they are not. Word for word they are the same. So save your money if you already have the yellow book and just study it a little bit harder 
 I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one. 
 For years with a combination of paranoia and political zealotry, conservatives have promoted the myth that the media was bias against them.  Most conservative believe this claim even through there is no real evidence to support it.  Brian Anderson's book, South Park Conservatives, is the latest book that tackles the subject of left wing bias that adds to the countless number of conservative books that have made the same claim.  In the book Anderson, main objective is to promote the rise of conservative news reporting, and to claim their reporting of the news is a lot more honest and factual, which simple research would show that those beliefs were never true.  One recent example to show that is not true is Ben Domenech who ran his own blog before he was hired by the Washington post as a blogger.  Domenech resigned, recently, when it was revealed he plagiarized from several articles he wrote for several publications including conservative ones.  Domenech confessed to that he plagiarized works of others.  This is one of the examples of dishonest journalism that conservatives have been involved in that Anderson does not talk about in his book.   Anderson's own methods of judging liberal bias is questionable and ridiculous.    Here are some examples of how he judges if you are liberal, and how he measures liberal news bias.   Anderson claims being a liberal means supporting abortion, racial preferences, a lack religious belief, having blame or hate America attitude, have no objections to Adultery and do your own thing 60's values.  Anderson never says how 60's values are bad, or what 60's values are supposed to be.  The simplistic and silly comparisons Anderson came up with in the second chapter of his book have little to do with real liberal beliefs, but how conservative prefer to see Liberals and Democrats.   This is to show a lack of respect and contempt of their political views with petty attacks and false claims.  In addition, Anderson mentions nothing about other Conservative biased views, of past and present, such as Rush Limbaugh racist comment to a black caller, during his early days on the air.  Shaun Hanity early radio days of Gay and Lesbian bashing, Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin columns being dropped because of their extreme biased and liberal bashing and finally Bill o'riley who threatened that San Francisco should be blown up by terrorist because they voted against Army recruiting.  Yet, these are the conservatives praised for being the one defending against Liberal bias with honest reporting.  Nevertheless, an [angry] rant that a city should be attacked by terrorist, expressing a hate for liberal views, racism and gay bashing has nothing to do with honest reporting or defending against the false claim of liberal bias.  In the book, Anderson praises the Conservative media for being the ones who got the late President Regan biography pulled from CBS because of objections from conservative on how the former president was portrayed.  Later in the book, he objected to [The Conservative] Sinclair broadcasting not showing an anti Senator Kerry film, Stolen honor, connected to his Vietnam service, a month before the 2004 November elections.  In the book, he claims that Democrats that controlled public pension funds threatened shareholder lawsuits if the film was shown.  However, that was never true.  The letter came from Glickenhaus & Co., a Wall Street investment firm holding 6,100 shares of Sinclair stock, their political affiliation was never mentioned in the letter.  And, even if Democrats were responsible it would not have mattered because Anderson had no objections to Conservative-Republicans, that included him, protesting against the Regan Bio.   So why should Democrats, he claim objected, not have the same right to do the same over the portrayal of Senator Kerry?  Anderson main objection over the Regan bio was its inaccuracy, which is the same reason for the objection of the bio on Senator Kerry, which he was upset that only 15 minutes of the two-hour bio attacking the senator was shown.  The predictability of South park conservatives was to praise the conservative media while ignoring it moments of being dishonest, while attacking Liberal-Democrat views with the same bias Anderson claims he is against.  It was also predictable in ignoring Conservative bias, which makes Anderson another conservative who is a hypocrite about fighting media bias, because they ignore the same bias in their own ranks.

 The West Wing is my favorite television show of all time.  Period.  Nothing else comes even close.  I could go on and on about the show, but others are doing an excellent job on that score, and that's not my point here.  My point is the awful, awful DVD.  No English-language subtitles (for the second year in a row).  Only two special features, both about the debate episode.  No insight from the actors about their take on seven years of ground-breaking television.  No tribute to John Spencer.  I feel as if the folks at Warner Brothers Television knew they had their market well in hand, so the quality of the product really didn't matter.  "No bother, we'll sell enough anyway."  I'm one of those that bought it anyway, but I feel as if I got ripped off.  
 Marlon Brando once said that his friends don't write books about him.  So what does that make Englund?  Marlon said about Carlo Fiore, a once questionable so-called friend, that he probably wrote his book about Marlon because that's all he had left.  The same seems to apply to Englund.  I mean, why describe the gory details of Marlon's last night on earth in such a disgusting manner that leaves such a bad taste in our mouths about the ultimate acting icon?  Seriously, would a real 'friend' have done such a thing?  Why not leave us with some glorious memory of Marlon as a true friend would.  I mean, without the help of Englund's book, Marlon left behind a legacy of fine art and entertainment that still amazes, inspires and motivates young actors and the world at large today.  Why taint that legacy with a discussion of backsides and dung as the last thing said about the Brando legend?  If Marlon could go his whole lifetime and remain an enigma (why we love him), and I believe he did it on purpose, what gives this so-called closest lifelong friend of his the right to expose him by sharing intimate details that he probably knows Marlon would never approve of and still call himself a friend?  He's a sell-out jerk to me, but that's just my opinion.  Would Alice Marchak (Marlon's assistant) or Jocelyn (Marlon's sister) ever write a book about Marlon?  I don't think so. And they knew him best and would probably have gotten paid major big bucks to write something, anything about Marlon. They didn't because people who truly love you don't do that.  Englund would have been more of a friend if he had just kept his big mouth shut and respected the greatest actor ever, but instead he proved just how much of a friend he may have been in life, but not at all in death.  That is the lowest of all the slimballs because Marlon probably died thinking this sell-out was his friend.  NOT!!!  Now that I think about it, while this guy is trying to make everybody think that once Marlon had made his peace with him he could go on and die now, Marlon, in all his glorious brilliance to the end, may have set this guy up, knowing his greed would lead him to go public with Marlon's backside and dung details and show what a jerk he is.  Now that sounds like a Marlon prank, being transparent and naked enough even in his darkest hour to expose the greed that lied in this so-called lifelong friend's heart.  Obviously Marlon knew Englund and that he wasn't a friend. Marlon knew Englund would prove his greed, along with his disloyalty, by making the stupid choice of painting for the world such a gory picture of Marlon's last night when Marlon was brilliant enough and deserved better from a "FRIEND".  The ultimate acting icon pulling the ultimate set-up. Way to go Marlon!  You were a genius to the end.  I see clearly, this bum for what he is.  Englund said that even on his death bed Marlon said "F death".  Well I say even on his death bed Marlon said "F You Georgie". 
 Completely unlike the classic original gangster movie starring Al Pacino. It has none of the characters from the original, the actor that attempts to play Carlito comes off more like a wannabe gangster dressing up, and the ending is utterly disappointing and insulting. Stay away from this one. It has none of the magic and charisma of the original 
 This book was assigned for a class in Adult Education, and was painfully inappropriate as a text. Merriam does not bother to explain many of the fundamental and seminal theories in Adult Education, and when she does, she spends twice the time explaining the critiques of these theories than she does the theories themselves. Many of the critiques are either unjustified or based on a misunderstanding or misapplication of the theory, as well    Aside from teh lack of comprehensive, in depth coverage of the field, the author's personal baises shine through in the content and toneof this book. Fields in which they have done research are emphasised in severla chapters and the "comprehensive" discussion of other topics often read like journal articles where the authors are only mentioning contrary thoeries to debunk them in support of their own hypothesis.     This book is barely adequate at introducing a new student of Adult Ed into the realm of theory. I would advise those that are not already followers of Merriam and Caffarella's school of thought to take this book with a grain of salt. And I would advise their followers to look elsewhere for a a balance to the biased perspective they present.   
 i didn't even see this movie and I know it sucks.  All that I had to see was Bon Jovi and I threw the video to the ground as hard as i could muster at the video store where i was promptly kicked out.  It was worth it though, it actually was offensive that such a thing could exist.  The vampire genre could be so awesome and yet very few films live up to its potential.  I guess it also lends itself to complete drivle such as "Vampires - Los Muertos" 
 Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I was totally amazed by the false information in this book. I don't think the author should write a book about a country when she lived there for few months. She missinterpreted so many things that happen regularly in our culture. She should know that women in Saudi Arabia choose to cover up. They are not forced to do so. The same thing goes to Catholic nuns, who choose to cover up for the sake of God. I think she should have talked to more educated Saudi women who could explain things better. She may have lived in a village where the majority were uneducated (that was in 1970's) and women were less fortunate. I'm currently working as an IT consultant in a huge company, my mother is a college professor and my father is really supportive and is proud of both of us. Nothing is stopping us from reaching our goals. I think people should look at a broader picture. I could have judged Americans by the acts of the KKK few decades ago. However, I lived in the US for two years with my husband, who is an engineer, and I had a chance to make good American friends. I cannot say all Americans are racists!! In concolusion, the book is a total waste of money. I do not recommend that anyone should buy it 
 Beneath my comments, writes Roseblatt:  ===================== In chapter 4, he is concerned with the 'limits of arbitrage' (the original title of this paper, published in the JOF in 1997). This paper is definitely worth reading to understand the problems with hedge funds and other arbitrageurs. However, linking the limits of arbitrageurs to 'inefficiency of the market' is erroneous. The very fact that arbitrageurs can not take advantage of what they think are mispriced assets, due to collateral constraints (Schleifer's hypothesis), shows that the market is efficient, since no free money is floating around.  =============================  No, with the 'limits of arbitrage', the mispricing cannot be corrected quickly. The logic lies like this: suppose A sees the arbitrage opportunity, but due to the "limit", he can only trade certain shares, and makes $10 FREE MONEY. He knows there is still another $10 "on the table", but he cannot take action anymore. At this point, if no one else sees this arbitrage opportunity, the market remains inefficient until another arbitrageir B jumps in and remove that "remaining $10 on the table". Of course A and B made "free money". Shleifer's treatment is perfectly Okay. Roseblatt's rebuttal is illogic and obviously wrong.  However, EMH itself is a hoax. It is not scientific at all. I believe in the early days, financial economics was dominated by people who had little quantitative or science training, therefore, they could only do something like EMH sort of soft libral arts type of research. To me, it is not EMH, it is how quickly the information gets reflected in stock prices; and how big is the limit of arbitrage. Nothing else. I suggest the new generation of high-level finance researchers should totally discard this spurious EMH topic. Period.  
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 One of the most important elements in a horror film is that the audience has to either, identify or care about the potential victim. In this case, I felt neither.  It's hard to be sympathetic towards people who are genuinely stupid. I'll explain. The girl in this film is being hunted by a deranged killer in a commercial pick-up truck. He steals her boyfriend away to take him to his gruesome and torturous demise. Once she realizes he is missing, she sticks around (all alone) in a deserted rest stop to get drunk on a bottle of whiskey that she discovers in a police officers desk. She calls for help and when a police officer arrives it turns out to be Joey Lawrence! Wough!! The killer runs over Joey and his death scene is acually quite comical. I can only hope the director was playing it for laughs because it is like something out of Monty Python. Joey is laying on a floor and he begs the girl to shoot him in the head to relieve him of his agonizing misery. She reluctantly agrees and sticks the pistol in his wide open flapper. She pulls the trigger and the next shot is Joey Lawrence laying on the ground with half his brains splattered on the floor telling her "You missed!, do it again" at that point I was waiting for John Cleese and Eric Idle to walk out and go into "The Lumberjack Song." This movie would be best viewed at Thanksgiving because it is one Freakin Big Turkey!!!!! 
 i dont speak english fluenty so i will write down a few things hoping that u understand me.First of all the writer tell us that he don't believe in miracles(so he is not a believer)and this seems to reflect to the whole book.BUT the most important thing with this book is that it is full of personal opinions and speculations.The important thing when you are dealing with the new testament is being documentary.German books(not all of them) that deal with new testament still are the most complete ones.  I have read so many books dealing with new testament and i am tired watching that every writer(usually with great studies and bla bla)has his own opinion.Writers could hold back their arrogance and focalize to facts(historical and archeological sources and information) 
 Indigo is another word for ADD or ADHD and, in the end, this book offers NO solutions or assistance of any kind.  It is an insulting and ignorant look at what so many families are struggling with and sends the underlying message, "You're doing it all wrong."  Don't buy this book and don't waste any time thinking you are a lazy, incapable parent because you can't solve ADD or ADHD.  Instead, look for real resources and doctors who can help you and your family. 
 I totally agree with Amit's review.  For a practitioner's perspective Bruce Tuckman's "Fixed Income Securities: Tools for Today's Markets" is a much better choice than Fabozzi 
 The book is about 50% actual negotiating tactics and 50% political commentary.  There were some interesting ideas insofar as negotiating strategies, but nothing really unique.  The author comes across as a combination of an friendly, lovable uncle and the Jack Lemmon character in Glengarry Glen Ross.  His political commentaries showed a breathtaking shallowness and lack of historical knowledge...such as his statement that the Western world's confrontation with the Islamic world began in 1979(?!).  In the appendices, Cohen includes several memorandums to top officials in various administrations which provide insight to a neo-con understanding of the world. That such an underdeveloped grasp of geopolitics occupies a large portion of the book throughout is disappointing, and seems to influence Mr. Cohen's thoughts on negotiating.  
 Lots of action, but totally unbelievable, just like watching wrestling. Amusing enough to watch but not to own 
 Lisa Gardner set up a great premise and wheezed the book to an improbable end.  There is enormous promise in the primary story:  what would keep a family on the run for more than a decade?  Yet I found the end contrived.  Given that this is a suspense novel, I don't want to say much, but I will say I have enjoyed Gardner's other books more 
 Clancy has gotten the best-selling writer thing down to a formula: a taut, suspenseful plot populated by militaristic all-American heroes and the evil-doers de jour. His merit lies in coming up with gripping, if improbable, settings for his stock characters. On the other hand, his actual writing is mediocre, unimaginative, and devoid of art.  Rainbow Six is the conservative Clancy's broadside against the environmental movement. The book's basic (and typically unbelievable) premise is that, in order to save the planet, fanatical environmentalists in charge of a major corporation devise a plot to kill off nearly all of mankind, while the brave men of the elite multinational force to which the title refers strive to thwart them. The unbelievable part: environmentalists in charge of a major corporation! Everybody knows that all the big corporations are in the capable hands of patriotic, polluting, profiteering Republicans 
 Yes this does have 20 packets of baby food in it, but they are extremely small...about the size of a sweet n low pouch 
 Gray matters is disappointing in many respects.  First, the cartooning is crude and not up to standards set by syndicated strips.  Second, there's not a single laugh in the whole book -- this is no Dilbert.  Third, the advice is common sense to the point of being patronizing -- it features such brilliant insights as "listen to people."  Wow, who'd ever think of doing that?  Finally, several character actions are highly unethical and could get you in hot water if you did the same, such as breaking into a co-worker's computer, or moonlighting without your boss's knowledge at a customer company strictly to get inside information.  You want to talk lawsuit?  Read "The Dilbert Principle" instead -- its insights are hilarious and telling 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 A disappointing rehash of early works on the 1781 Siege of Yorktown.  Half the book deals with the southern campaign of the American Revolution.  The portion of the book dealing with Yorktown strays greatly from the chronological happenings of the siege.  For example, the author starts detailing the story of the assaults on redoubts 9 and 10, which occurred on the night of October 14th.  Before completing the account of the assaults, he jumps to the sortie by the British on the night of October 16th and then after several paragraphs goes back to the assaul on the redoubts.  A better choice for those wanting to read about the siege is Henry P. Johnston's book on the Yorktown Campaign 
 Out of fairness, I should tell you that I didn't listen to the whole audiobook.  I got about 1/2 way though the first CD and just couldn't stand it anymore.  What I heard was boring and extremely slow moving.  It's read like a "see spot run" story for children, which makes the boring storyline even more boring and I found it to be a bit insulting.  I think an audio book of names and nummbers in the phone book would be more exciting.  Maybe it gets better as it goes along, but I am not willing to endure any more to find out.    
 while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die?  have i gone to horrible movie hell?"  you see i was trapped in a theater.  it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat.  the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape.  in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow.  but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo) 
 It wasn't as impactful as I thought it would be.  Some of the people that gave comments gave some great comments and others, well, other gave comments.  The selection of people was a good cross section but it didn't have meaning to it.  I was looking for more in depth commentary.  Maybe what I was looking for should have been said between each of the comments in the book.  It might have looked like hugh just collected a bunch of email and old letters and thrown them together 
 We have watched all of the movies in this collection. Some of the movies (about 1/3) are either inaudible (hard to understand what the actors are saying) and/or skip parts (words/scenes) because the film is so old. My husband and I watched at least 3 of the movies per week, and what strikes us most is that many of the films in this "horror" collection are nowhere near the "horror" movies we watched on Saturday Matinees at the movies in the 60s. Over half belong in the "mystery" or "comedy" category. And what's with all the gorillas? Every fifth movie it seems has a gorilla in it.  These horror movies are from the 20s to the 60s and are much more tame than todays horror flicks, granted. But, come on, why should we have to sit through a movie where the quality is awful and the movie is not a horror movie?   Again, there were too many gorillas! Not that there's anything wrong with gorillas, but we prefer ghosts to gorillas. 
 I bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers.  Let me be candid....what the hell were they reading?  This book is simply insipid, implausible and a waste of time.  Get this for a premise....rich, geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the "Connecticut Nutmegs"!  Nutmegs for a major league team??!!  Yeah, right.  It gets better....he has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the C-list movies he produces....ok hold on to your seats, here comes the good part....she is going to be his star player on this MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL team!!  Why, because in college she was an excellent athlete.  So some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball!!  Am I the only one who thinks this is plain stupid.  Oh, yeah there's a murder along the way.  Parker (author) must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise I can't think of a reason why it got published.              
 While reading this novel, I wanted to be "awarded" the white silk rope to hang myself.  Boring, slow, characters dancing in and out. Not a good read. 
 I finished up my last batch of these discs bought some time ago, without a problem. BUT the next batch purchased most recently will not record on my Philips CDR 765. There are too many different types of media discs and not labeled properly. Should be an industry standard that the consumer can readily see that they can use them. Not sure what to get now or if another brand will work properly 
 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o 
 I just want to say, this book is BAD.  The characters have no change and/or development that doesn't make them meaner, cruder people, and the whole book is FAR too shapeless and confusing.  The main character is a boy  that goes against his parents' wishes to go to church, who eventually  cusses and has few associates.  His remarks against girls were unpleasant  to me as a female reader, and his desciption of Preacher Man was of a guy  who sweated and had freaky eyes.  Talk about pointless.  This book is a  disgrace to literature 
 This is a great sweeper, but its tragic downfall is the short lifespan of the battery. We bought one a couple of years ago from Sears with a Sears replacement warranty. Since then we have replaced it FIVE times (we really got our money's worth from the warranty, at least!)It's getting to be a joke--one day (usually 2-3 months after we bring home the new one) the rotor just stops turning and that's all she wrote. Next time we will purchase a different sweeper, warranty or not 
 Hi, I received this item twice, both times they were packaged improperly, causing the boxes to have dents. They were bought for my daughter who "collects" them.  I specified extra packing on the second item, to no avail.   Since I now have to file a dispute through my Credit Card company, to get my refund, I will no longer shop with Amazon 
 This book has less information than your average Stevie Nicks fan site. It is a waste of money. Very little information, just a lot of rambling about Stevie's mystical yearnings, most of which are assumed by the writer. Almost no biographical information. The book itself, and the photos, are poor quality, very inexpensively done. They put the worst photo of Stevie they could find on the cover. Go figure. The whole book yammers on about Stevie's mystical vision, in a sophomoric manner. I'd be embarrassed to say I was the author. As it is I'm embarrassed that I purchased it 
 I thought Keegan was a "serious" historian.  This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a "serious" miltary analysis of the iraq war 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 Unfortunately i was not impressed by this book, i had heard so many great things and bought it based on reviews, and my love of nature - but i have picked this book up three different times and can not get into it, i just find it boring. I am not a nature hater, i have a bird feeder, a bird bath, a dog and a cat as pets, I love animals and can stare at the birds at the feeder for a long time, infact that is much more entertaining to me than this slow moving, boring book.  I will pass it on to a friend, and hopefully they can find the magic in the book that i was unable to appreciate. i just found it to be too dry 
 This is what happens when great authors go to seed. It seems like a cruel mockery of a Greene novel, parading the same old themes around, corrupted more than ever by an unjustified excess liberalism. There isn't a single living character here, and even though the prose is generally competent, I think it has to be buried in consideration of the man's memory 
 Glynis provides a clear to  the point descriptions to the number meanings, but I dont like her approach to Numerology. She seems to believe that its 100% accurate, and a sole reason to make or break a relationship. I find her brand of numerology kinda simplistic and would reccomend Numerology and the Divine Triangle as a more in depth accurate brand of numerology 
 People seem to like Ja, but outta all his songs i only like let's ride, othawise I dont like em. 
 Not  a profound book. Lots of story-telling to make a few good points. A fast and fun read. 
 As one who's studied the Mountain Meadows Massacre and other aspects of the Old West, I like a good yarn as much as anyone. This book, however, was a disappointment. Author Sally Denton kept her readership on a short leash and never let anything get in the way of trashing the Mormon church. While other authors kept away from the fraudulent lead tablet while its authenticity was in doubt, Denton showed her disdain by buying it hook, line and sinker.  This tragedy happened before the "Civil War" for goodness sake. Going after the Mormons now is kind of like going after the Israelis for attacking the Liberty back in 1968 -- even worse. No one's left alive who was living back then and there was plenty of animosity between the Mormons and the Yankees, and the Mormons and the emigrants. Californians, who could have kept their mouths shut, constantly threatened the Mormons. In 1862-63, Abraham Lincoln showed how easily he could have civilians murdered and their homes burned with hardly any backlash.  Mountain Meadows was not unprovoked, but it was inexcusable. The right people were never brought to justice and Brigham Young should have seen that they were. But I don't think Denton's animosity now is justified. With all the Southerners murdered by the Union, Mountain Meadows was totally insignificant in comparison.   
 I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that.  The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.   
 This book illustrates the difference between important and merely influential. It virtually invented the vague/portentious prose style that signifies boredom and alienation, and appeared as late as 1996 on the liner notes of Rage Against the Machine's "Evil Empire".  But it isn't very good. The dimestore existentialism aged, badly. Didion's spare writing now seems phony and juvenile. The same characters experiencing the same emotions have been rehashed so many times, often in superior forms, that what was innovative in the seventies doesn't really cut it anymore. Not that it was very original in its time, coming as it did after thirty years of Sartre and ten of Antonioni. Not to mention Horace McCoy's terrific 1935 novel "They Shoot Horses Don't They", popularized in a Hollywood film (coincidentally?) only a year before "Play It"'s publication.  A minor footnote to a still-evolving trend 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 I bought this album because I loved the first single "Promiscuous" so much.  The rest of the album is unfortunately quite blah.  There don't seem to be any other standout tracks other than "Promiscuous".  I like that she went in a different direction from her first two albums, but it just doesn't click and most of the tracks are mediocre at best.  I'd recommend just downloading one or two songs on I-Tunes and avoid wasting money on the entire album 
 Reads like a law textbook. Author often uses three sentences where one would do. Much ink is wasted telling the reader "we won't go into that here, but Chapter "X" deals exclusively with that." Concepts are understandable for those with an accounting background, but definitely would not recommend to someone without a solid grasp of accounting fundamentals. Author should have hired a writer to help him smooth out his writing style. Not recommended 
 This is a sad attempt at modern science fiction.  I was appalled by the lack of continuity and the plotting errors.  Remainder Bin here I come 
 I have read many cosmology books despite I am not a trained scientist or the like .. I found this book extreme boring and very frustrating to read and understand , It jumped from A to B and back to A with diagram which are hard to understand . The author is trying hard to convince the reader on his believe but lacks the tool to do so in a "friendly manner" .  I laboured through this book and in the end I found myself learned nothing .In fact I am hesitated to even pass this book to my friend to read  
 I watched Battlefield Earth because it just went into rotation on a cable movie channel and I had to see if the rumors were true.  I made it to the end, waiting and hoping all the while for some redemption that would make it worth the trip.  Sadly that never came, and as the credits rolled I chose to fall in line with everyone else who says this movie is an unqualified disaster.  In fairness to Travolta (though he is hardly blameless), L. Ron Hubbard's story is the main culprit, horribly conceived and best considered another failure of many by a misguided loon.  That said, those who follow crazy people don't deserve much more respect.  If Travolta wished to venerate his fearless leader, the least he could have done was attempt to turn Hubbard's semi-fictional paranoia into something at least marginally entertaining.  Artistic license would have gone a long way toward saving this mess.  Instead, the story became a mockery of itself, leaving this production a sad effort from otherwise very talented actors 
 Leaving aside the fact that the author lied through his teeth (e.g. he never actually studied Hwa Rang Do - he offered the Lee brothers some ink and they gave him a faked history) this stuff is about as inefficient as any stick fighting book I've ever seen. Try Marinas' Panandata, Mark Wiley, the Presas brothers, Leo Giron or Ray Galang for stick stuff. You'll be much better off 
 This book is very good until just before the end. There are too many things left unanswered at the end. For example - (1)What was the exact relation between Williams and one of the cousins? (2)When was the microphone placed in the office and by whom? (3)What was the role of the personal secretary in the conspiracy?   ...And many more! 
 This is an interesting,informative and useful book.  I used it for school and it will be one book that I keep.  Great case studies 
 I do like Gurhke. Having said that this book was one of her worsts for me. The writing style was great but I hate and let me say again hate cheaters. If I pick up a romance book I want it to be about the H/H and not those people commiting adultry. Whats so romantic about that. And John was going to "woo" his wife to get back in her good graces when did that ever happen. I just can't say anything that I did like about the book. But if you like Heros that cheat then this may be the book for you 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 Initially unimpressed by the first chapter of the book, in which Freely provides a cursory summation of Byzantium's early history, I was amazed to find on page 13, the first of Chapter 2, that he mistakenly identified Mesembria (modern day Nesebar)as the Greek colony closest to the Bosphorus. It was in fact, and still is, Apollonia Pontika (modern day Sozopol), which was one of the earliest Greek foundations (late 7th century B.C.). The rest of the book is an assemblage of information, much of which will not be particulary useful to a visitor. The book's saving grace is an excellent bibliography for the reader to explore. For tourists, the "DK Eyewitness Travel Guide - Istanbul" is a far better companion; easier to carry, containing excellent color photographs and diagrams,and full of historical information 
 In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.  from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.  everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.  it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.  
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 While I usually enjoy books of this particular genre, Betty J. Eadie's "The Ripple Effect" was disturbing.  She describes the death of her baby daughter from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in heartbreaking terms.  The scene in the book touched me deeply - until I happened to describe it to an expert on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, who said, "What she is describing is physically impossible."  Who EDITS some of these books anyway?  Who PUBLISHES these books without at least doing enough preliminary checking of the facts to see how plausible the events described within really are 
 I enjoy Jackie Chan's films but this was an exception.  It would have been fine to have cast this movie with just Jackie Chan and Fann Wong.  These two actors were great as a team.  Adding Owen Wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot.  When he wasn't tedious, Wilson was boring.  Why was he even cast in this film?  This was a movie I won't be in a hurry to see again 
 "The Island of Lost Maps" is the story of a petty crook named Gilbert Bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the '90s.  Posing as a researcher, Bland would enter rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single-edged razor.  Then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers.  Before being busted at the Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, he had stolen more than a half million dollars' worth of maps.  "Island" is the first book for author Miles Harvey.  In the book, he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page book.  He is only partly successful.  I found the material on Bland's crime fascinating.  However, Bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull.  Unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text.  I found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime.  There is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking. But as a true crime book, it over extends itself.  It would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused 
 I would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. The roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out, and you find yourself rolling it over & over again to get a decent amount of gloss. The gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) And it does taste & smell delicious. But it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. I would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. It would make a great product 
 A joke that swept through The University of Texas a long time ago:  A freshman physics teacher at Texas A&M asked his class to name the greatest invention of all times.  One student said fire.  Another said gunpowder.  Another said the internal combustion engine.  Then a Texas A&M football player on the front row said, "The thermos bottle."  When asked by the teacher why he would pick that as the greatest invention, the student said, "You put something hot in it and it stays hot.  You put something cold in it and it stays cold."  The teacher asked why that made it great, and the student replied, "How do it know which to do?"  That thermos bottle is in this book in the form of a magic (indistinguishable from magic) sphere.  I liked the first book, in spite of its "magical" science.  This novel seemed like a shaggy dog story leading to the thermos bottle.  Much ado about little 
 "Just a Note to Say ...: The Perfect Words for Every Occasion"  is a wonderful concept, however many situations were omitted and the  "notes"  are sparse for the occasions presented.   More glaringly  however, was the misspelling of "congratulations" on page 82.    Spelling incorrectly in the introduction to the section  ("congradulations"), it was fortunately corrected within the  examples given.   In an age where spelling checks are typically routine, a  book published in 1996 sadly falls short of basic editorial practice.      Clarkson Potter Publishing certainly drops the ball 
 While I agree with the author that hormone balance is essential to good health and well being, I have to take exception to the "estrogen dominance" theory. The author is clearly a disciple of Dr. John Lee and his bogus theory of estrogen dominance. I was a victim of this rubbish until my problem was diagnosed as estrogen deficiency. As any woman going through menopause will tell you, there is no such animal as "estrogen dominance" and the perpetuation of this nonsense is the cause of much misery. A much better book on female hormone replacement is "Natural Hormone Balance" by Uzzi Reiss 
 Hey, c'mon.  Whoever thought this book would be good for children is just saying that because it was illustrated by Sendak.  I got it in a group of books from a sale and I have 2 kids ages 3 and 5.  I am all for teaching about injustices and the plight of the homeless but it takes an adult with a masters degree to "appreciate"  the message and illustrations here.  Don't buy it for anyone under the age of 30 
 My mother (she's a great grandmother) bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  Unfortunately, at her age, she forgets to keep receipts.  This item did not even work for two days.  When I returned after Christmas, I tried to return it but could only exchange because the packaging had been thrown away. The second Video Jr. Now continually skips if you just bump it.  I can never find any new discs at Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, or anywhere else.  I put in a complaint to Hasbro/Playskool but I have never received any response back as to how to return it.  I mean, it cost $40.00 and it's not worth it.  I would not recommend anyone paying for something that doesn't last long.  
 Anyone hoping to gain an objective insight into the complex tragedy of the GLF should avoid this book at all costs.  Despite the author's reputation as a noted scholar in the field, he makes sweeping, generalized claims that  are simply not documented.  In discussing the negative aspects of the GLF,  for example, all efforts are made to present Mao as not  responsible--somehow separated from the policy-making process and therefore  not responsible for the terrible consequences.  The millions of deaths that  resulted are acknowledged, but the author quickly points out that Mao did  inspire millions of workers in China to work for the common good, as if  this somehow compensated for the maniacal toll on the country.  I don't  know why Mr. Macfarquhar is such an apologist for Mao, but it clearly  interferes with the balance of his analysis and would outrage any sensible  student of Chinese history 
 Having listened to Outkast since Southernplayalisticadilacmusik came out in the early 90's, I have always been excited when they drop a new album. They have always pushed the envelope and pushed hip-hop in new directions, opening new doors. But, this album simply didn't work.  There are highlights, but overall, this is a very uneven album. Most Outkast albums standup to repeated listening (Aquemini hasn't left my CD-changer since the day it came out) but most of this album gets tiresome after a few listens. Only "Church" stands up to repeated plays. The rest of the album should be taken in small doses. "Ghetto Music", "Tomb of the Boom", and "Last Call" are fun songs that I like to hear occasionally when I'm in the mood for some loud, big-beat club-style hip-hop. While "the Love Below" is certainly interesting, Andre's experimentation falls flat for the first time in his career. There are no real standout tracks on this second CD though most are listenable, but leave you thinking "Hmmmm, that was interesting and I respect you for trying something new, but..." You just aren't tempted to push that play button again right away. Compared to the hip-hop that generally gets radio airplay today, this album is better, but compared to Outkast's other work, it is a huge letdown. Southernplayalisticadillacmusik was a tempting showcase of talent that foreshadowed the good things to come, but it was pretty standard fare for southern rap at the time, although done better than most with a few hints of experimentation. (3 1/2 stars). Outakast really broke through with ATLiens with stripped down beats and ambient highs and thoughtful lyrics (5 stars). Aquemini (5 stars since that's the highest mark, but it deserves more) marked the highwater point of Outkast's career thus far. It was (and still is) an absolutely amazing album that can be held up as a standard against which others can be measured. (Only Goodie Mob's "Soul Food" is on a similar level in my opinion.) Stankonia was a bit of a drop off after Aquemini, but still an extremely solid effort with some standout tracks like "Gasoline Dreams" and "Humble Mumble." (4 Stars). But, with this latest release, Outkast seems to have lost some of the edge that made their earlier albums so great. I respect Outkast for constantly trying new things (that is what made ATLiens and Aquemini instant classics) and can understand that sometimes expiramentation will not go as planned. Given that, I look forward to thier next album and hope they can recapture the magic that made their second and third albums so amazing 
 I'm sure CHB is upset because his gravy train has been disrailed, but the truth is this curse was always something the media loved to bring up instead of talking about racist owners and bad baseball decisions.  Except for Dan's relatives saying how you should buy this DVD, this story is due to hit the bargain bin anyday now. The Dollar Store will have it too.  I'm sorry Dan. Now you are really going to have to work to write your column 
 ...and to be honest I hated it. She has that dramatic face in every movie, it always looks as if she's going to burst into tears or something - so she's mostly just fit, it seems to me anyway, for these tragic "no hope for mankind"-movies. Plenty is a movie so Britain-grey that you should never watch it on a day you feel tired or something, you'll only get deeply depressed. And do not misunderstand me, I am no fan of shallow comedies, I'm moved by actors like Hopkins in Shadowlands and Penn in Dead Man Walking - but the woman Streep plays in this movie, well, how many women could identify themselves with her? What is Plenty trying to tell us?  Two stars for Stings' effort as Mick in the movie. Not a big role, but his character has "sex" with Streep - and is basically used by her. And finally Mick is the first to call her character "insane" if I remember right. Big Deal? No, but I am a big fan of Sting - therefor let me add : Are you a Sting-fan, add this to your Sting-dvd-collection.  But watching the movie is pain!  
 Should be titled 'Art of Selling Products, Making Hundreds By Manipulating Prospects'. Excellent for brokers or insurance agents looking for a quick fix in getting appointments or products sales, but the buzz will wear off.  A big disappointment for fee-based planners or advisors looking to expand  their client base. It deals more with manipulating prospects over the phone  than with practical face-to-face financial services sale 
 Sorry...it's not what I expected. I kept thinking, "where is this going???" It just wasn't funny. It reminded me of something written 100 years ago. But that's not to say someone familiar with Portuguese linguistics (maybe a German academist or an up-in-coming Dr. Dr. Longname, etc. etc. hrumph, cough), could not read between the lines and find this humorous...it was just a little dry and boring to me. After the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors, it got tiring. I read every single book in the Ladies Detective series and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the next Precious Ramotswe story. This, however, was a disappointment. I'm only sorry I bought all 3 in the series, sight unseen, based on the other books I'd read by Alexander McCall Smith 
 Why did they stop the regular videos with the supermodels. Does everyone have to get into the reality show rut? 
 Horrible. The gears ingage before the tape is even loaded. You have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it's own. When the tapes are rewinding it is very loud and slams the tape when it is done. You can just hear the damage being done. This model destroyed several of my daughters tapes. We really needed a rewinder to preserve our vcr and chose this model because it has an option to clean the tapes, preserving them also - this would be great providing it functioned properly. Thinking maybe I got a defunct one I had Amazon send out another, it too functioned in the exact same manner. Nope mine wasn't bad, their all bad, this model is disfunctional. I've advised Amazon not to carry units that they have become aware do not work properly. I wish Amazon direct had good models to choose from, this one is not 
 Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I was very excited about receiving this book, but then was disappointed to discover it was Christian-oriented.  From the description I was led to believe it was metaphysical in nature, so I'm returning the book.  I was hoping it would be a great addition to my collection of metaphysical healing references. This would probably be a great book for someone of the Christian faith, but it will not work for me 
 I am (was?) a great admirer of Doris Kearns Goodwin's work. "No Ordinary Time" was a masterpiece of historical writing. But this early biography of Johnson just doesn't stand the test of time. It's MUCH too theoretical and lacks narrative drive. Johnson was an immensely interesting figure. It says everything that this book makes him dull 
 I'm glad I read this book for the subject matter, though there were so many problems with it I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. Cohen bases the book on the memories of old people, and some of their resistance efforts sound like pretty tall tales. I couldn't help but make the comparison with an 89-year-old gentleman I know who claims he sat on a purse snatcher until the police came. Some of the feats they credit themselves with accomplishing are simply unbelievable. There are also discrepancies. For example, Vitka is once called upon to bury a body in a forest in great haste, and I assume we're supposed to think she did it with her bare hands since she had no tools with her. Then much later in the story Vitka sees a dead body for the first time. Huh? Vitka, however, is the real heroine of the story, brave and selfless. Abba is an intriguing person, but my impression was that he gave the orders and took care of himself while his women did all the work. His fanaticism in later years was disturbing, though after what he lived through it is hard to judge him fairly. It's uplifting to know some Jews did fight back and that many lives were saved because of their courage, and that's the best part of the story 
 This book contains the usual worn out far left liberal drivel that college profesors have been trying to shove down the throats of uninformed students since the 60's.  In particular, the author's attempt to blame crime on poverty, etc. etc. leaves me nauseous.  Has he ever considered that our culture's failure to teach its young about moral absolutes might be a contributing factor?  He is entitled to his opinions, however misinformed they may be, but the book should come jacketed with a warning label 
 If MTV was smart, and they used to be, along with funny, relevant, and entertaining (they even played music videos all the time!) It was on all day in my house, and you could always count on the VJs passing along some wacky facts, or artists dropping by who could actually speak coherently. Anyway, MTV could make their massive video catalog available to the public. You could browse online and choose the videos you wanted, pay $2-$3 each and MTV would either create a custom DVD for you and send it out, or you could download them and make your own DVDs. I would gladly pay to have several DVDs that contained only the videos I wanted. And there are about 100 I want, just off the top of my head.   As it is, I am happy to watch my old and fading copies made back then and occasionally catch an old great on VH1 Classic, rather than have someone else pick out 10 videos, 4 of which I may want, the rest I don't. This one did nothing for me. Luckily it was a gift. I never would've bought it for myself 
 The dust jacket of this book boasts that it is "the first comprehensive photographic record of the bombings". However, its idea of comprehensiveness - while finding room for a film poster of the 1952 Robert Taylor movie "Above and Beyond" - does not include *a single one* of the tens of thousands of corpses littering the ground of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   That's right. As far as the 500+ photographs in this "objective, informative volume" [quoting the dust jacket again] are concerned, our two atomic bombs - while producing a lot of rubble and five mild burn victims - did not cause a single fatality.   The chief author of this book is identified as "a retired U.S. Air Force officer". Make of this what you like 
 A friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because I like Cooks Illustrated.  This magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants.  There are so few recipies in it I wouldn't call it a 'cooking' magazine.  What few recipies they do have don't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all.  If you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine, then this magazine might be for you.  If, however, you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it, try Cooks Illustrated instead. 
 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 This product is not worth the money or trouble.  I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up.  It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up.  Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating 
 We've had this phone for about a year. There are 2 major flaws with this phone.  1.  Range -  Maximum Range from base to handset is about 15 feet.  More than that and you get static or dropped call.  2.  Unable to Connect To Base.  We receive this message alot.  Even when standing next to the base.  We've had these 2 issues off and on over the last year.  It has gotten to the point where we can only answer an imcoming call by using the speaker phone located on the base unit.  Needless to say, we are dumping this piece of garbage and getting a new (non-uniden) phone 
 Don't waste your money on this one.  It was recommended by "Rich Dad" advisors, but doesn't tell you how to get going.  And unless you live in or want to travel to one of the 29 "lien states" there's nothing in for you.  The other states are not mentioned 
 Where does this fit into American Law:  You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate m 
 I just took a week-long trip to New Mexico and gave up using this book after the first day.  I found my free AAA New Mexico Tourbook far more complete and informative 
 The book isn't good at all. I'm sorry. I loved I am Legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies (Hell House included) I was really excited to read this. I have heard many complaints about the book from calling it "soft porn" to "sick soft porn" and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale. Sacrilege in a book called...Hell House is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up. Attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary. I doubt these were Mathis' "sexual fantasies" in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying. It is an effective way to convey horror to a reader. Similar to enacting horrible violence on children, or worse, babies in cinema (try watching the Hills Have Eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face). Mathis should not be condemned for content.  Here is what he did right. He took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science. Much like I am Legend used science to define its vampires, Hell House uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and believable within the framework of the story.  The bad parts may be more numerous. His characterization is horrid. There are four characters really and their personalities do not define them. You will remember Barrett by his limp, Fishcer by his fear, Florence by her religious beliefs, and Edith...well because there is no one else. They are paper thin and have no real motivations. The pacing seems poor too. A lot of moments are left on revelations in the point of view characters mind which that character has not fully processed because the chapter ends before they can relay it and all of its profound meaning to you, the reader. As a matter of fact the revelations themselves, when all is said and done, are really pretty dull. There is also a habit characters have, when going into great lengths of exposition that goes on for pages, to cup their hands around a coffee cup. It seems too much like a commercial for me! Anyway, the book hardly slows down for characterization or details and we get very few vivid descriptions in the book. Sometimes I wanted to know what things looked like, I wanted imagery not just exposition for pages. What was it about the atmosphere that, say Fischer found so scary? We needed the scenes to be better developed. By the end I was so tired of lines like:  "God do you know what this means?" "What?" "I can't tell you now but it's freakin' awesome!"  That exchange is not in the book but you will find many similar moments throughout. Just tell us already! The fear should come through our attachment to the characters not the mystery of the house because the mystery of the house is kind of weak. This book is not worth it, unfortunately. I hate to say it because I Am Legend is really good (though it did suffer from some of the same things I pointed out above, though on a smaller level). It's the classic "show don't tell" advice 
 I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie.  My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it.  My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting.  It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well.  The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward.  Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there.  Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast.  We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California).  I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself "why?  Why am I wasting my time like this? 
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 My husband and I are transitioning to raw foods.  We have read numerous books and were prompted to buy The Raw Gourmet because of the cover and the incredible photos inside.  Truly, the pictures are stunning.  Unfortunately, the recipes lack that certain something.  We made a few, but there were no instructions on exactly how to get the results she got in her pics.  In some recipes, the photo didn't even show the same ingredients she lists in the recipe!  I returned the book to the health food store after one week.  There are better raw food books out there.  See my review on Rainbow Green.. 
 i bought this book/dvd in the hope it would actually take me through various pieces for the classicl guitar. instead it spends overlong on things like nails, scales  and arpeggios....having the lessons set in mocked up gym was so cheesy as to be embarrassing. all we got was the maestro zipping through some fine pieces...what i wanted was step by step instruction on how to play them!!! dont buy unless you have the intellectual capacity of a boiled potat 
 I love bosa nova and brazilian music having discovered it on many a business trip to Rio.  This disk is like brazilian muzak.  No soul to it in my opinion 
 umm how can a so called child of god put out a explict album and play it off as if hes some big christian with that song jesus walks  im sure if jesus was here to see this he would be dissapointed because it seems all that mr west is trin to do is use jesus as a marketing tool to the music its not good at all id advise you to listen to something else anything id rather listen to apples in sterio 
 The book does not go indepth into a lot of physics problems. It will solve one question on one topic and then give the student a bunch of other questions at the end of the chapter that are different and harder than the solved example problems. Everyone who has taken college physics knows that there are a lot of variations to different questions, and there are conditions and exceptions that must be taken into account before a problem is solved. If you have a crappy physics professor, like I had, this book will make physics a nightmare for you 
 Worst idea, ever. Someone please remove his larynx. One star gives him too much credit 
 I really had to push myself into finishing the book instead of throwing the book against the wall in frustration.    Why?  Because the book offered gems like "Manage your cash. Startups in the bubble years burned through money, but companies today have to be run much more tightly."  I got the sense that the authors were just trying to fill the pages when same quotes were used 2 or 3 times across different chapters like a high school student trying to pad a book report.  Intriguing title but ultimately the authors just served up rehashed conventional wisdom 
 I like the smell of this fragrance very much but have trouble with the sprayer mister.  Maybe i just have a defective one but I need to unscrew the top and dab it on 
 This book is a good idea. But there is room for litterature that can tell the same in a more lively way with far fewer words. ...or can tell four time as much with the same number of pages. - The language of most of the authors is such that you wonder WHY they have chocen to say what they attempt to tell in such flowery ways. After a paragraph it's hard to remember "What did he try to tell me now." It's easier to think: "Yes. I can see that you have learnt a hole lot of words, and adjevtives in particular." - I have found litterature about the same topic, put in a different language that manage to do this far better. In fact I've found public reports that with regards to the ability to convey a thought is far more readable 
 I agree wholeheartedly with the premise of "The Gift of Shyness" -shyness is a positive not a negative condition and shy people everywhere have something to offer the world -- sensitivy and intelligence.  That's the good of the book.  The problem is a lack of depth and too much repetition.  I couldn't finish the book due to the writing style.  It sounds like it was written for middle school kids 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 I bought this cd when it first came out as a huge HRC fan. Vagrant records also has a quality track record judging from their band roster and their ability to somehow summon up the best of a band.  I thought HRC would benefit from much higher production quality as well as the influence of oustanding acts such the Alkaline Trio and Saves the Day surrounding them.. However, owning for the cd for nearly two years with many listens has made realize that the band used to create captiving, listenable hardcore is gone.  Nothing about this cd particularly interesting or grabbed me even on the first listen.  The disc loses its appeal early as nameless, medtempo pop crowds the speakers.  The vocals are more clear, however; the trade off is less compelling melodies and a lack of creativity.  Tracks like "the Pharmacist" identify a theme of short, competent, but boring songs.  I haven't heard anything more form HRC released this album and I don't think i would shell out 15 bucks again for something I would hear on the radio 
 Ming has a good idea: Take one basic "master recipe" and apply it to three or more different dishes. Fantastic! Applying general concepts like this is the basis of learning to be a real cook. I'm sure that the concept would be a great boon to many home chefs.   Unfortunately Ming himself is far too irritating to watch for long. His tendancy to be a smug, overbearing, know-it-all and impatient to boot render his show unwatchable by anyone but a Business School frat boy.   If this guy has a book you should buy it and skip the heinous alpha-male kitchen posturing (with a ceramic chef knife) 
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 It is a book about a dog. A cat liked a dog because he doesn't do dog things like bark at night,howl,beg and run away!There is a big suprise!I read some of the book so far and I liked it, so will you 
 I was watching Cinemax one night, bored out of my mind and unable to sleep, when this movie came on.  The acting made me laugh.  The premise made me laugh.  Everything about it made me laugh.  Hey, at least it was fun to make fun of anyway.  Just kinda mad that I wasted a good 80 minutes on this piece of crap 
 I ordered Panasonic 1GB Secure Digital (SD) Card ( RPSDH01GU1A )Which is a 66x speed (10BM/s)I received RP-SDQ01G which is 33X speed (5MB/s). Ritzcamera will cheat you.   You can find the part they sent me for $20 less on Amazon with free shipping 
 TV is the proper forum for Dr. Phil's platitudes.  The self-induced strife of the show's guests are entertaining, and makes the viewer want to slap a little sense into them.  Dr. Phil steps in a does just that, vicariously applying the slaps, and we feel thankful to him.     Beneath Dr. Phil's oozing earnestness and rectitude there is nothing profound, original, or particulary instructive.  All the material in this book could be compressed into a few solid pages.  The rest is fluff, most of the form; "When you follow my advice, you will be happy/succeed/fix your marraige/lose weight".  He continues in this fashion, rarely specifically stating anything that might qualify as advice.  Robbins, Dyer, Mandido, Carnegie, et. al. have more to say and say it better.  
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 I am a Cary Grant fan, but I was extremely let down with this one. The storyline itself is funny, but not the antics. To sum it up, I found it slow moving and dull 
 After 6 months of use, the handle holder on the lid came off due to fatigue at welding joints.  Since the other pieces also uses spot welding at the handle, I'm fearful for my safety and contacted Sitram Customer Support.  This is their response  "While we have the ability to authorize replacement for the defective products that have handles coming off, we are unable to satisfy a request to credit other product that has not shown signs of being defective"  In otherwords, they're not surprised the product is defective and I'm not the only one complaining.  If I'm stupid enough to buy a whole set, then I'll have to return each item as it falls apart.  Too bad if the defective will maim me in the process.  Stay away from this defective and inferior product if you value your health and safety.   BTW, I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they agreed to accept the return.  Love Amazon. 
 This book is unfortunately as tedious as the last book in this series.  The plot and cast of characters are a bit more real than last go round - the only reason for the two stars in my opinion.  There are way too many tedious details, repeated and gone over way too many times.  Did I mention that it was tedious??  Again the final moments are quickly rushed through.  And please - we would like to know what happens when the last "bad" vampire is gone!  We spend way too much time with our hero and heroine and then the scene just peters out and makes us wonder what happened next?  Although quite frankly I really don't care that much about them - I just invested my time and would like some closure.  I keep hoping that Ms. Drake will improve but I'm not holding my breath waiting until the next release 
 Sound track other than the primary cut, LaBamba .Did not seem the same as the movie.Would not recommened the sound track.Was purchased as a gift 
 I love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when I buy them.  I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared. In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched: One hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle.  It would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn't properly sealed/Melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven.  The handle came about half-way separated from it before I stopped using it.   This is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization, quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag.   I would advise Victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price.   Some of us are ready and willing to pay a higher price for a quality product. 
 I have a good grounding in photography and was hoping for more detailed instruction on product photography. I learned practically nothing. There is a lot of very elementary filler material on general photography, digital cameras and editing software and Internet. The photos are not that great either. May be somewhat useful for someone who has no knowledge at all of these topic 
 Bought this movie because it rated 4 on average from other amazon customers and because I generally enjoy Will Smith's movies. While there are some funny moments I found the plot unconvincing and the characters (very) two dimensional. Obviously this is meant to be a romantic comedy and I wasn't expecting any depth but this was supremely shallow. Hitch the date doctor supports inept men in finding their dream partner, all the while he himself has not recovered from a traumatic college romance, so guess what, he has commitment issues. Enter attractive journalist, who funnily enough also has commitment issues behaves in a totally neurotic fashion is incapable of adult conversation and because she has issues exposes Hitch as the date doctor in newsprint, using the time honoured phrase, people deserve the truth, come on.........it's not politics. Despite her behaving like a jilted teenager Hitch discovers his deep love for her, and you can't help thinking that you yourself would be running a mile in his place.  I sat there wondering whether it would get better and waiting for it to end, if you want romantic comedy you could do better with something like guess who, meet the fockers, prime, or even the "old classics" you've got mail or return to me. But give this one a miss 
   Like everything in the world, this coffee maker is lawyer approved. In other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm. Unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee.   Every day I have to warm my coffee up in the microwave. 
 I bought the game couple of weeks ago. I was hesitating on buying it initially, but finally I did because of all the good hype about the game. I wish I didn't buy it.  To be fair, I have to admit that the game has astonishing landscape, cities and the level of details in the game. I don't think I have ever seen suhc creativity and perfectness in earlier games. I am sure that are lot of people that will find such features enaough for them to adore the game.  For me, landscape is not enough since the largest downside is the story, if there is any story, "from my perspective". I have abandoned playing after closing the 4th or 5th Oblivion gate. I don't see any excitment in playing the game any further. I explored most of the cities though, quite quickly. The conversation looks silly that every time the camre will zoom in to the person you are chating with. It was nice the first couple of times but then ....  I am waiting for my sweet gothic3 to go out. Honestly I would prefer playing Gothic1 on playing oblivion. Just to tell you about the action/excitment I am talking about, I would like to say that when I got gothic2 I played for almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water and play play and lots of play.  
 After 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please. 
 I have read some of Meg Cabot's other work, and while a little entertaining, I keep hoping that the author will surprise me and come out with a good read.  I know chik lit is big right now, and so are mystery series.   So I assume that she was out to mesh the two together.  But she failed horribly.  The heroine's dialogue with other characters and with herself is so childish and unbelievable.  The circumstances surrounding the character and throughout the whole book are very generic and flat.  I really wanted to like this book, but it was just soooo boring and ridiculous.  There was not one redeeming thing in this.  If you are wanting a GOOD mystery/romance/chik read then I highly recommend reading Kasey Michael's Maggie series, or Charlaine Harris's several series or Carolyn Haines's Bones series.  And I recommend the author Jane Green for just a good fun Chik Lit read.   All which are much more entertaining, worth the time, and better written.  
 I'm sure this book has something to offer--- but I had trouble with it from the first page. I like for the books I read to make sense in the details-- if they don't, I can't take the book seriously.  Right off the bat, we are told that she leaves Birmingham, Ala. for the Alabama coast, and she leaves at sunset.  Her father has to give her encouragement to send her on her way.    Why does she leave so late-- no reason is given to account for her driving after dark.  An hour later she drives into a hurricane.  Why didn't she or someone in her family check the weather report.  A hurricane doesn't just appear suddenly-- we know from the recent hurricanes that they are seen days, or weeks, in advance.  So she is driving down Interstate 65 in a hurricane, and decides to get a motel room.  She stops at a fleabag motel with part of the slgn lights out. Where, on I-65, would anyone find a motel like that?  I have been on I-65 dozens of times and from one end to the other, it's all chains motel, and nice ones.  No homegrown motels. The real estate along an expressway is too expensive for dumps. It would have been more believabile if she had stopped at a Holiday Inn. Then, she calls her friend Cass, and tells her she will be leaving at dawn and will arrive at Florabama before noon.  Another 5 or 6 hour drive?  Get a map.  If she was headed to the Ala. shore it would be a much shorter drive than that.  Details like this can make or break a book for me.  I couldn't take it seriously, and I lost interest. 
 I thought this was a film about Caouette's mother and her struggles. I thought it was about how she was subjected to electric shocks and maltreatment. I thought I would see a documentary about her life. And what did I see? An extraordinarily self-centered and self-obsessed young man forcing his ego on me. It's all about him, him, him. It seemed more like an exercise in self-display than a film about a serious topic. Stay away from this film 
 Save your money. I love the movie very much, and to watch it and to listen it is an experience like none other. However, if you look for the music from this movie, do not look here. This is just the movie, except without video. I have great respect for Bonfa and Jobim's work on this music, but they do not get glorified truly since the tracks change so quickly and the movie sounds play such a large role in the soundtrack cd. Listen to Trio da Paz and their Black Orpheus album and see how it compares, and even though it is not the original Jobim or Bonfa, it pays more homage to them than this original soundtrack. Verve took the wrong route with this one. Yes the music is landmark in evolving Samba/Bossa Nova, but this cd does not depict truly how wonderful the music is 
 I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have I see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why... I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.   The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work. I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase. The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch. To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay 
 This book is good, but it is too unrealistic, and main character, the football jock Brandan cried too much.  It started off very good and interesting, because you gotta see clint & brandan different point of view and how people think differently without knowing what others think. Then afterward the plot is getting too unrealistic and like chances for that happen is zero, after like clint & brandan meet nathan & ethan, they are almost like identical twins and very similar (or same) backgroud and like everyone around them is all accepting and so.  It is not a bad book, but actually i expect more from it 
                   At a time when many historions and authors are bringing out important re-evaluations of the causes of World War I, there are still large numbers of the same that continue to bolster the accepted,"Official Versions of Who Caused the Great War".                   Aside from some of the defects mentioned by other reviewers this author presents the German military as operating in a vacuum. That, in fact, the military alliance between England and France, with France also having a military alliance with Russia, all of which was aimed at Germany specifically, had no consequences or dangers to either Germany or Austro-Hungary. That the then massive bank loans of France to Russia had no military application when, according to French documentation, the loans were tendered with the understanding that they would be used to insure the ability of Russias military  to mobilize rapidly against Germany.              Furthermore, the political and cultural attitudes in all of the European countries had no bearing on the military thinking of all of the militaries involved.                There are many other better histories available.                 
 We purchased this bed with the intention of using it for vacations, sleepovers etc.  However, we soon came to realize that setting this bed up is no easy feat. It comes in four seperate inflatable pieces. You need to first assemble the footboard to the headboard which is done by fitting plastic pieces into each other and turning them. The only problem is they keep falling out. The battery operated ( 4 D cell batteries) pump that is included is painstakingly slow. Even with an electric pump which we used, there are many different air chambers that need to be filled and it is quite time consuming. This bed can not be set up in minutes as they claim and as far as taking it apart, to fit it back in the storage bag you need to completley deflate it. I would not recommend this bed to somebody looking for a travel bed. We ended up returning it 
 I notice that none of the reviews actually mentions having cooked any of the dishes.  I agree - the book is gorgeous - but the recipes are not.  I tried three of them - all failed - and I am a good amateur cook.  I donated the book to the thrift shop 
 Doplh Lundgren (Silent Trigger, Peacekeeper) stars in, yet another action thriller. This time Lundy tackles the role of a man who is hired to protect a beautiful model who is being stalked and threatened by a evil mad man. Lundgren and the baddie go head to head but there's one problem with Lundgren...years ago he had an accident and from there he is lacktose in tolerant which he cant stand the color white. The badguy uses this to his advantage which creates a corny showdown where Lundgren is blinding by white. John Woo's worst movie and putting Lundgren in it was a mistake also. The model is hot but this movie is not. I'm sensing a pattern in the movies Lundgren always picks..he's sorta doing the same thing, Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme are doing. Lundgren has only died in one movie that I remember and that was Universal Soldier..Seagal died in Executive Decision and Van Damme in a few. Well,, you get my point I hop 
 Imagine how unfunny and unenjoyable the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie would have been without Depp's sustained impression of Keith Richards.  If that comparison doesn't work for you, imagine a name for a rock band that sounds funny and cool the first time you hear it but gets tedious and childish the more you hear it.  Got it?  That's what it's like to read Gideon Defoe's The Pirates!: In an Adventure with Scientists.  I think the main problem is that the kind of stylized anachronism Defoe wants to do only works if you are really good at it.  Defoe does not seem to understand that random humor is actually not random at all; it operates according to certain associative rules, and Defoe's book rarely contextualizes the silliness in a manner that works.  It sounds extremely funny for 16th/17th century pirates to be sailing around in the 19th century with 20th and 21st century props, but Defoe's execution misfires.  He simply does not take advantage of the opportunities implied by such anachronism.  Another problem is that Defoe's novel actually has a plot.  Granted, it's not a very interesting plot, but I don't understand why Defoe went to the trouble.  In Pirates of the Caribbean, it doesn't matter what Depp's Captain Sparrow is doing at any point in the film; after all, the plot is highly boring.  All that matters is that Depp keeps being funny despite the rest of the movie.  Defoe too often bends to the plot rather than his goofy characters.  In the beginning of the novel, the characters' asinine dialogue is quite enjoyable, but Defoe too often abandons the goofy piratical banter for sight gags.  Sight gags in a novel?  Maybe a few here and there - like the bouncy castle - but Defoe, c'mon?  Sight gags work much better in TV, film, and animation.  I heard the author reviewed on NPR and I thought that this book sounded hilarious.  The truth is, the interviewer only brought up the very few funny parts whereas the bulk of this (thankfully) short novel bored me.  This is not satire or lampooning; rather, it's a forced and artless kind of humor that is funny when you've drunk too much grog but not when you are marooned in sobriety 
 What a disappointment!  It sure looks like there's a good mystery in this book somewhere but digging through all the detail and ploding style is just too much.  A great read if you're looking to become an insurance claims adjuster 
 I waited five years for this piece of junk? THe sotry was nonsensical/non existent, and the animation horrid. Also, what was up with the character designs in this film?   I keep forgetting Ken was in this; he doesn't DO anything except react and make comments I'm sure are pithy in Japan.   There was so little fighting in an anime based off a fighting game. There's just NO excuse. I actually started hitting FWRD on my DVD player to see if anything actually happened!   Tekken the Movie was better than this, and read my review of THAT to see what I mean. Only Amazon's rating system prevents me from giving this NEGATIVE stars. 
 The positive reviewers are mousy especially Akon. Akon was never heard of until last year when it was his debut. What corporate buisness today is giving out the free record deals (as everyone intelligent says) and pick strangers from out of the street, dress them up, don't have the inspiration of writing their songs by themselves, and is a get-cash-quick scheme? MTV. I have more than the rights to say that this album that everyone you see that will love this, has a possible chance that their IQ is lower than average. We can't stop this madness. It was too late when MTV Networks (Independent MTV) sold to Viacom.  Regarding to Akon's first album, I have heard the song 'Lonely', only that Bobby Vinton should sue him for speeding up the pitch of Vinton's classic track 'Mr. Lonely'. Vinton doesn't deserve the ignorancy correlation that nobody that was born after Vinton's time haven't known 'Mr. Lonely'. He should sue, and I hope and pray to God this will get Akon's career to the incinerator, and to black ashes.  If your personality is the antonym of the word 'mind-lacking', then you should not buy this album like me. But, the people today on planet Earth are estimated 68% ignorant! It's up to our duty to reduce the percantage of ignorancy, and not to fall blindly into MTV. All in favour? AYE! All opposed? (dead silence).  As to my intelligence, I like music that isn't mainstream today. Listen to all the genrés that don't influence money 
 If this is a re-issue of their 1994 debut album "Life", then can someone tell me why "Carnival" wasn't included?  I love the Cardigans, but for some strange reason their biggest hit in Europe was not included in this CD.  For that reason alone, I defintely do not recommned this album and I urge people instead to purchase "Life".  I give it 1 star because it is utterly perplexing why "Carnival" wasn't included.  
 I guess I am the only reviewer who found this book tedious and banal.  It's more a series of thumbnail biographies of pga tour players, linked together through weekly accounts of pga tour stops, than anything else.  Feinstein's writing seems to move along at a brisk enough pace, but after several chapters, I found one event starting to blend into the next, one Q school qualifier after another, one harrowing tournament finish after another, and so on, and so on.  Feinstein's writing verges on being formulaic- it's all written in a sort of breathless, anxiety filled pace, as the nail biting details of who's missing the cut, who's choking under pressure, whose marriage is on the rocks, who's in danger of returning to Q school all gets mixed together in a swill of golf gossip and insider minutia.  What I found missing in this harried chronicle is any sign of the transcendental joy that marks golf at it's best.  It's almost as if Feinstein writes to show us how miserable and unbearably tense the world of professional golf is.  While some of the details he provides are interesting, overall I found the book repetitive and lacking in the sort of poetry that the best sports writing sometimes achieves 
 First of all, this is NOT the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars. The worst movie ever made was "Autumn in New York", but that is a different review.   No, this not a great movie, but it is very interesting. And for once, thank God, it doesn't end with everything tied up in a pretty Hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone. It has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie. And the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie, bleak.  More interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack, this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing. For Molly Ringwald, she didn't do anything of note again until "The Stand" six years later, and for Andrew McCarthy, well it could be argued that he still hasn't starred in anything of note again (although he probably made some money from "Weekend at Bernies" I & II).  Anyway, probably better to rent than buy, I am only buying it to complete my 80's collection.    
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 As far as crime dramas go, this is firmly mediocre.  The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction.  Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink?  And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice.  (Do they even make it anymore?  I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist).   And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames.  You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed "Smiley" Jones if you never mention "Smiley" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname.  That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned) 
 Wake up and understand who controls the media and who they vote for.  Why would these Dem voting owners and employees possibly push a Republican Agenda?  Can you possibly answer that?   What about Dan Rather trying to subvert an upcoming election with false reporting prior to an election and yet he was supported by his media outlet until the whithering fire from other outlets forced him to admit the story was false 
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 The advice he gives men and women is ludicrious.There again  working off sterotypes.No one in this day and age should be  told it's ok to have random sex.Of course he aims this at the male because it his warped mind only men go on a ramage after  a bad relationship.Women do too but it's left out of the book because as we all know he believes women are love starved  junkies only craving romantic attention and romance.He also believes,wrongly,that women are the most hurt,oh yes,that  self worth and waves coming again at the woman.He views women as somehow half a person without a relationship while a man can build up himself financially and socially,if not sexually after a break up.Women are the downtrodden in his view,the victims. Save the poor little women from themselves is what I hear coming from him.When it comes to men,he is right there ready for an ego boost saying,you can do it.He comes across as an over protective father with the women.He has some need to see women as needy,pathetic love junkies 
 I found most of the recipes not to our taste.  If I do try the 2 or 3 that might be good, I will definitely use my slowcooker, since that is the cooking method that seems to make the most sense for these recipes 
 The Taunton Press has published some excellent books - I especially like "Built-Ins". But this books seems to have been thrown together with little thought or integrity. Featured are numerous pictures that can been seen in their other books; this recycling of images is an affront to the reader - I never forget a photograph, and feel ripped-off when I recognize it from a different book. The Taunton Press should re-think its strategy; re-hashing previous publications and slapping on a new title is lazy, unoriginal, and insulting to its readership 
 I find it very telling Judge Cristol included so few photographs of the damage to the Liberty. They clearly show most of it, with the exception of the torpedo hit, was inflicted by rocket fire from the planes. The use of rockets in the attack is officially denied by Israel. Why? Because most of the superstructure and much of the hull took scores of hits from almost every conceivable angle. Many of them penetrating several bulkheads. The ship looked like an angry grizzly bear got to chewing on a steel bucket. Such extensive damage clearly refutes Israeli claims the air attack involved only 4 aircraft and a maximum of 6 strafing runs over 12-14 minutes. It does support survivor's statements that dozens of strafing runs were made over 25 or more minutes. These facts alone should cause any reasonable person to very seriously doubt the "accident" explanation for the attack. Consider also this. The aircraft flying at a typical cruising speed of 500mph would have burned about 10gal/min of fuel. In 25 minutes they would have each used 1,500-2,000lbs. The pilots wouldn't have consumed so much fuel over the target unless they had planned for it in advance.        
 I found this book really wordy and confusing.  The images are not numbered and do not have full refrenced captions, which makes finding infomation on a particualar image very difficult.  Also, the chapters are in chronological order, yet several images and some information is not in the chapter of the correct time period.  This would be fine if those images from a time period other than what the chapter covers were being compared to images from the time period, but they are not ever that i noticed.   
 After borrowing my brothers, I decided to buy my own jerky gun. I bought the exact model he had but my first one would not advance the meat. Amazon replaced it with another one that still did not work, the cap kept popping off when I pressed meat into the tube. I returned that one too and gave up after that. If you can afford to pay $40, then go get yourself a real jerky gun.  Pros: Cheap, cleans easily. Comes with a variety of spice packets in the box.  Cons: Cheap, flaky mechanism, capacity is only 1/2 pound, must refill often (two fills per dehydrator tray)  Advise, if you use the cure that comes in the package, use only 3/4 of the quantity, the prepackaged amounts tend to make the meat too salt 
 Sorry, Rod, you're still not sexy. And if I had the choice, you wouldn't get any stars from me.  Is he trying to kill music as we know it??  I have listened to a lot of music, and a lot of bad music, but this is by far the worst album that I have ever heard--although I have not heard Rod Stewart Kills Classics Album 1 and 2. It's hard to imagine how he got true musicians like Stevie Wonder and Dolly Parton who have not sold out to participate in the massacre of innocent songs.  Please don't buy this album. It will suck out your soul and you will have to pay nearly $20. 'Easy' listening is a conspiracy to kill all aural audacity and intelligence we have as humans. Instead of listening to recycled festering turds by desperate washed up rock stars that think a back-up band is a synthesizer, pick up something interesting that you haven't heard.  Top-ten suggestions for the anti-this-album:  1. Animal Collective, Feels 2. Aretha Franklin, Gospel Recordings 3. Junior Kimbrough, Most Things Haven't Worked Out 4. Don Byron, Ivey-Divey 5. Nico, Chelsea Girl 6. Lucinda Williams, Car Wheels On a Gravel Road 7. John Cale, 1919 8. John Coltrane, Love Supreme 9. Van Morrison, Astral Weeks  and if you absolutely have to listen to the songs on Rod the Bod's classics albums, an EXCELLENT vocal/instrumental album (which is incredibly soothing but still brilliant) is...  10. John Coltrane & Johnny Hartmann, John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman 
 We too have the same issues with this that everyone else has mentioned.  We already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off, nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem.  Now a month after using the new one, its espresso pump is loud and noisy, sounding like its broken. Also for some reason or another it won't send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso.  It ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out. But then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine.  Its been going for the last couple of days, but its such a iffy thing. On the plus side it does look nice! And it does make a good tasting espresso when it does work! My husband does agree with the directions are hard to follow, but he says that about everything 
 Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God "out of the box," such as Tiffany Snow's "Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect." Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's "7 Laws" though, and some of his other works 
 Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled "reapeat".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor 
 This book poses some good arguments, but is tedious as a whole.  Breese can only treat these individuals in a cursory fashion, where most of them have volumes written about individual facets of their lives and  philosophies.  To attempt a discussion about Darwin, Freud, Marx,  Kierkegaard, Wellhausen, Dewey and Keynes (not to mention Einstein, whose  ideas, Breese argues, gave birth to relativism) in a volume of this length  is to create a good introduction, which I think this book accomplishes, but  no more.  Breese's style is at times witty and sharp, but the historical  redundancy of his chapters and the brevity of the discussion on each  individual leave something to be desired 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 If you were hoping for a skin flick, this is not it.  A couple of minutes of long shots of the young girls swimming topless and one real nice look at Julie McCullouh (...), in bed, is not enough too qualify.  The acting is awful.  Angie looks great for her age.  Still not enough 
 This movie is such a waste of your life. The plot is horrible, the characters are horrible, this MOVIE IS HORRIBLE! It makes no sense whatsoever and it's a sucky fairytale. I really can't understand who thought it was funny! Maybe if the plot would be way different, it might be okay, but the writers failed. Once again, I HATED IT! 
 JIll gave me her recipies for Prime rib,Yorkshire puddin, mushrooms, brussles spurouts, Pasta melonaze and others years ago and they are a staple in my home.  I gotta get her book before it is too late 
 like the other reviewer, i don't think i got the correct filters. i didn't open mine, but these don't look like the typical filters with the familiar monitor on top. i've heard rumors that the filters with the monitor are no longer being produced, but i hope not... i chose to return this item and purchase a dented box item which i hope are the correct filters. if PUR stopped making the monitored pitchers, i'm gonna be very upset...  IN ADDITION, the description on the box i received said that these filters are for water coolers and bottles - it said NOTHING about compatibility with pitchers, unlike the description.  UPDATE 4/16/2007: i contacted PUR regarding the filter compatility. the company says that all newer pitchers accept the CRF-950Z. however, since june 2006, the filters "no longer have the u-shaped life indicator on the top." and that SUCKS. maybe it didn't work well, but i suspect financial incentives for that elimination. the email came from [...] - we should all complain 
 This book is a little too ambitious in trying to cover a lot of ground: history of Chinese martial arts and taijiquan, what is qigong, what is taijiquan, photographs of the Yang long form, a few applications, and more. Unfortunately it is rambling with a lot of digressions of the author's own opinions on how taijiquan is "spiritual" - a little bit too long winded to be of practical benefit. Several reviewers mentioned the book draws on some of the author's other books so perhaps that explains this effect. Good basic content, but better editing would have made the book more organized and easier to read and study. There are some good practical tips on actual practice spruced throughout but they can be hard to spot. Overall, a more concise book focused on these tips would be much more beneficial. There are also too many self-serving references to the author's other books, which I found a little annoying. It seems he is more interested in selling a lot of different books than in writing one really good one. However, the photographs are of very high quality and the pages and binding seemed fine to me.   The bottom line: If you are BRAND NEW to the art and want to read a lot of context and commentary surrounding taijiquan, this book may be worthwhile for you. If you have been studying for a while and are looking mainly for practical tips on principles, this may not be the best book for you. There are other excellent books you should check out such as Fu Zhongwen's Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan 
 If you are looking for a book to learn a few parlor tricks about palm reading, there are other books out there that are better.  This book is literally a miniature book, being only about 4 nches long and does not  offer any substantive info on palm reading..  I don't recommend it 
 I usually enjoy her books but this one was truly disappointing. Such a silly plot. I finished it but kept saying to myself..."Why not just toss this one?" 
 I would not buy it!  Hard to use. My machine runs slower since the install.  
 ...but that's to be expected since this is, after all, written for the sort of person who is somehow STILL behind the Bush Administration's foreign policy, even after more than four years of it.  Well, this much can be said: At least the author showed some consideration for his true audience by keeping things extremely short and simple.  Simplistic, in fact.  That audience is very easy to recognize--they're the ones, while reading this book-priced magazine article, whose lips are moving 
 I was intrigued by "Satan's Little Helper" due to several things namely its Halloween theme, which I'm a big sucker for, and the heralded return of Jeff Lieberman to the horror scene.  Lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70's and 80's, the last one being 1987's "Remote Control".  You would think that Lieberman, with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return.  Well, it almost feels like Lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp, as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80's due to how cheesy, trashy, cheap and godawful it is.  Many, myself included, look upon the 80's slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be.  The "plot" revolves around a 10-year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game "Satan's Little Helper".  It's now Halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume, which he wears proudly.  One afternoon, he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as Halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house.  He becomes enamored with the tall & mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper.  The two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community, as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy (whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5-year old than a 10-year old) inexplicably thinks it's all still a game of make believe.  If you think the plot sounds bad that's nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed.  Nearly everything about it is god-awful from the camcorder film quality, to the laughable gore effects (including the least-ever convincing intestines I've ever seen) and especially, the acting. The 10-year old boy, who appears in nearly every scene, makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory.  The acting on just about everyone's part is bad, and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason, the flaky sister and the eccentric, kooky mother.  There is not a single character we can give a darn about and we don't care the least bit when someone gets killed.  Granted, dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen, but these ones truly take the cake.    I'm a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews.  I'm thinking some people are going to put this in the "so good it's bad" category but I'm not having it.  Some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be "funny", such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman, an elderly lady, and a stroller carrying a kid, are downright appalling.  The villain himself is a bad joke, as he doesn't utter a single word throughout the film, instead delivering thumbs-up signs to the kid and wagging his finger.  Cheesy?  Heck, this film is cheesier than a Black Diamond factory.  "Satan's little helper" comes across as the work of a first-time wannabe horror amateur with no budget, not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker.  To sum up how I feel about this film, I will repeat a line that I see all over Amazon that I usually feel redundant but somehow I find to be entirely fitting for this movie.  DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS GARBAGE!!   
 I thought it was time I expanded my literary experience to include a higher-education type author. Big mistake. I always try to see a book through to the end no matter what but this one really tested that conviction. I was ready to pitch it into the fire after the first chapter as Mr. Kafka himself suggested we do with all of his 'work'. And why didn't I like it? Because it's nothing more than disturbed stream-of-consciousness phychobabble...dark, depressing, manic, mundane, absurd, surreal. Very Lewis Carrolesque but without the imagination and color. You feel as if you're trapped in this guys never-ending disjointed dream with the vague awareness that you will eventually wake up. You do, after you turn the last page and realize that you've just wasted far too much valuable time dedicated to finishing a work that hasn't enriched your knowledge, sparked your imagination or widened your scope of understanding. I don't care how cheap you can buy it...don't 
 It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages.  The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do.  After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more.  The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister.  I recommend that one over the Netzer book 
 I'm fascinated by the rave reviews for this text. I used it for a community college stats course and once I was in the classroom with it, I became aware that I had some problems. It is true that it's written in a friendly style and has plenty of exercises, but I found it to be poor preparation for my students who will be going on to higher levels of statistics in behavioral science courses.  I found myself explaining, more times than I wish to recall, how formulas look different in other statistics books, and I was disconcerted at the lack of use of symbols that one usually sees in beginning statistics courses. Simple terms most commonly used in statistics were not introduced at all, and most statistical tests were not mentioned. Many students found it to be cumbersome and a bit overwhelming.   It's my own fault, really. I did not spend enough time perusing texts. And my familiarity with statistics prevented me, when looking it over, from realizing how much was really missing. I realized that my students would enter bachelor's programs lacking some very basic information that is always used in statistics for the behavioral sciences. Most of my students plan to earn graduate degrees; I had to spend quite a bit of time preparing notes for them as well as lectures explaining formulas, symbols, and terminology that "some of" their higher courses might use. And with nary a mention of ANOVA or any other higher level tests, I felt I really had done my students a disservice.  I began to wonder - have I been out of school so long that things have changed this much and I'm not aware of it? But - as I am teaching at a state college, stats texts started trickling in from other publishers. I saw that it was not me. This massive text, costing my students $120, is lacking quite a bit that they should be exposed to - to better prepare them for future statistics studies in the behavioral sciences. This was certainly a bitter lesson for me! I had to waste far too much time putting together information that was missing just so my students would have the course they should have.  I recommend Sally Caldwell's text, "Statistics Unplugged" for beginning students - at least in behavioral sciences programs. It's a third the cost, a third the SIZE, and much more reader-friendly. And it contains the information that I had to supply to my students just so they would get what they paid for.   I do not recommend this book. I'll certainly be much more careful in future when choosing textbooks 
 I did not like this book because:  It was too short.  It was only 60 pages.  60 pages of paper stapled in the center.  The information could be helpful to some If they had never read anything anywhere else ever about carpeting. I didn't feel like this "book" was worth the money.  I think there might be more informative resources at a more economical value for the carpet buying consumer 
 What a disappointment!  There are 4 CDS and no printed guide whatsoever to either follow along or to locate a passage at a later time. Bogu 
 These batteries didn't last at all. They worked OK in my remote control for my radio, but on everything else, the quality was either below-average or just horrid. My digital camera didn't even turn on with these. Only recommended with low powered devices; actually I'd recommend a Rayovac or an Energizer rather than these. I know they're only heavy duty batteries, but the quality is still below-average 
 Before I start, let me nail my colours to the mast: I'm pro-science, I'm pro-evolution, I really like the idea of rational enquiry and I'm a sceptic bordering on the cynical. I'm *not* some lentil-munching, kaftan-wearing, feng-shui-hugging hippie with airbrushed unicorns and a yin-yang sign on the side of my Kombi. Honestly.  Now we've got that cleared up, let me say it straight: This book takes on some big arguments, but, other than humorously swatting some flies, loses hands down. All it succeeds in doing is illustrating that there are fakers, losers, charlatans and wankers to be found in the Social Sciences departments of any given University. Anyone who's been to university and didn't know that deserves a clip around the ear and to be sent to the back of the class. Now either Sokal didn't know that ( - ~clip~ -), or he's spent half his book shooting fish in a barrel. That might seem like good sport, but before long it becomes obvious it's a cheap thrill.  Having said that, I sincerely doubt that the titillation of seeing dumb French Feminists taken apart is what made this book such a splash: I think it's because of Sokal's purported intent: to undermine the notion of cognitive relativism, especially as it associated with modern philosophy of science, in particular the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. This is the battle: Sokal aligns with those who say scientists are the exclusive purveyors of a shining light called truth; the Barbarians at the gate are these simpering postmodernists who want to tear the temple down.  While the poseurs cited in this book are certainly (for the most part) phoneys or idiots, I think Thomas Kuhn was neither, and while Paul Feyerabend overplayed the court jester hand, he had some important things to say too.  So, to the first point: Proving that one writer (or a hundred, or a thousand) who purports to adhere to relativism is a charlatan doesn't establish anything about *the idea* of relativism. All you have established is that you have a found yourself a charlatan. Give yourself a star.   But while you're pinning it on, remember that postmodernists do not have a monopoly on illogical, bamboozling, balderdash:  Example: Sir Roger Penrose (Emeritus Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at Oxford University, no less) and his dreadful, lumpen-headed, and deliberately bamboozling anti-AI tract "The Emperor's New Mind". The very point of the (no doubt correct but nonetheless entirely irrelevant) science deluged on the reader in that book is to obscure the fact that the real emperor was Roger Penrose and his arguments on AI really blow the kumara.   Example: Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker's Linguistic Nativism, which has held sway for a good thirty years in many linguistics departments, and is anything but post-modern: nativism holds that humans have an innate understanding of grammar hard wired into their biology. From my paltry readings in linguistics and the philosophy of language, my impression is that Pinker's and Chomsky's arguments are seriously flawed. (See: Sampson: "The Language Instinct Debate" for a thorough linguistic critique of nativism; see Rorty: "Contingency Irony, and Solidarity" for a philosophical perspective on the contingency of language). Make note of this example, as it becomes relevant later on.  Secondly, Sokal and Bricmont (quite deliberately) refuse to engage on certain topics, in particular on cultural or aesthetic relativism, which they say (without providing a reason) "raise very different issues". Take that star away, for this statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about relativism. Actually, ethical, aesthetic and cognitive relativisms raise different manifestations of *exactly* the same issue: Cognitive relativism, in that it relates to "epistemic" truth (as opposed to "moral" truth or "aesthetic" truth - both of which seem intuitively more questionable ideas) is simply a cut closer to the quick: indeed, the aesthetic and moral brands of relativism rely for their plausibility on cognitive relativism anyway (i.e. if the truths we understand about the physical universe are contingent on our language, then it follows that ideals of right and wrong and beauty must be similarly contingent on our language).  Thirdly, Sokal provides the following account of cognitive relativism:   "While scientists ... try to obtain an objective view ... of the world, relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is, in principle, an illusion"  Now that, to put it mildly, is a *very* punchy version of relativism, and not one that any credible relativist philosopher I know of (and certainly not Thomas Kuhn, who spent a whole book explaining how and why the process scientific discovery works) subscribes to.  That is, in the trade, known as a straw-man argument: You set it up to knock it over. Here goes:   P1: Relativists say science is a waste of time P2: Science helps us reliably predict and react coherently to phenomena occurring in the world  P3: Things which help to predict and react to such phenomena have genuine utility  C1: Therefore, science has genuine utility C2: Ergo, science is not a waste of time  Case closed. Is relativism dead? No: the problem is, most relativists I know would completely agree with all of the above argument except for premise 1. The cat is most definitely still out of the bag. (In a nutshell, all reasonably stated relativism says is that you can't know that your theory actually maps onto the actual configuration of the outside world; it may, it may not: logically there will always be some other possible explanation for the same set of data, however implausible or difficult to imagine, and in part that difficulty in imagination may be a function of the historical contingency of our belief in, and description of the world in terms of, the current "paradigm". Relativism simply says the best you can do is to know that, for now, your theory works, not that it is *true*. Though Sokal and Bricmont may disagree, I don't think this is controversial amongst philosophers nor, really, scientists.)  Lastly, in criticising an admittedly utterly ludicrous passage bestowed on the world by that splendidly silly feminist philosopher Sylvia Kristeva, Sokal makes the following footnote:  "...Kristeva seems to be appealing ... to the 'Sapir-Whorf thesis' in linguistics that is ...that our language radically conditions our view of the world. This thesis nowadays is sharply criticised by some linguists: see, for example Pinker ..."  Hold the phone. The implication is that the Sapir-Whorf thesis (as to the contingency of language) has been discredited, but by none other than Steven Pinker in his "The Language Instinct" which, as per the above, is at the very least a controversial piece of writing. This is an extremely important point, since it's utterly central to the credibility of the anti-relativist cause, and if one takes Geoffrey Sampson's book (cited above) at face value the nativist claims themselves are built on very suspect reasoning and scientific research. It seems to me (and to writers like Richard Rorty) that language must radically condition our view of the world, because that's the only basis on which we can even describe it.  At the end of the day, properly stated cognitive relativism is no a threat to modern scientific discourse, except that it relegates the scientist from "truth knower" or "person through whom you may have exclusive access to the truth" (sounds a bit like a grand high pooh-bah or - dare I say it - high priest, doesn't it?) to "person whose theory works the best for now" and who may be in competition for that status with other people in the community whether or not they're scientists.   If science *does* work better than feng shui or healing crystals (and I, for one, think it does) then this shouldn't be a particularly troubling way of looking at the world for a scientist who is at ease with his views and his value to the community. So it makes the knee-jerk reactions against relativism, from the likes of Sokal and elsewhere Richard Dawkins, all the more mystifying.  Olly Buxton 
 Disclaimer:  I have only been able to sample Professor Butz's work.  I looked at those portions of particular interest to me.  I read what he had to say about Jewish demographics, that is, the number of Jews in Europe before and after the Second World War.  I also looked at what he had to say about the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, at which the Germans, according to the standard historians, decided on the Holocaust. I was also interested to see how he evaluated the Nuremberg trials of the top Nazi leaders.    On population figures, Professor Butz will not accept any data from Jewish or "Communist" (i.,e. Soviet) sources, since, he says, such sources are tainted.  Jews and Communist lie, according to Professor Butz, so why listen to them.  On the Wannsee Conference, he quotes the Nazi sources that speak of Nazi plans to deport all of Europe's Jews and to enslave them.  But since these Nazis did not spell out an intention to kill all Jews in so many words, Professor Butz finds that, therefore,  this source is reliable evidence for his proposition that no such killings took place.  In Professor Butz's book, moreover,  whoever says that he has witnessed the Holocaust is a liar.    On the Nuremberg trials, he finds that any incriminating statements by Nazis to have been extorted by cruel and sadistic Allied guards.  Professor Butz's work gives evidence of great industriousness.  He has many footnotes and supplies many figures and pictures.  Such apparatus has been taken as a sign of deep scholarship by his friends and supporters.  But his analysis of all these data is simple:  whatever supports his thesis is accepted, whatever contradicts it is called a lie.  But unfortunately for Professor Butz,  it is quite impossible to accept his thesis without also accepting his notion of the Jews.  He sees Jews of all stripes -- from the most Zionist to folks like Noam Chomsky -- as united in a vast conspiracy to dupe the non-Jewish world.  Moreover, in order to accept Professor Butz's work, we must also accept that this Jewish conspiracy, this "Hoax" as he calls it, was also uncritically accepted by all the professional historians who have worked in this area.  Everyone is a dupe, everyone, that is, except he himself and his handful of friends.    Is that plausible ?  I don't think so.  
 You'll appreciate the information but hate the spiral binding! After a few weeks of use, the book was almost falling apart. I had to remove the binding, 3-hole punch the pages, and put the book in a small binder. Even after going through that effort, the book is still falling apart.  The perforations are so far to the left and the pages are so thin that it is very easy to rip pages as you turn them.  This book was not made with "quick use" in mind.  It's disappointing that an indispensable reference tool was made so poorly.  It's not worth the price they want for it because it's basically disposable.  If you use it consistently, you'll need a new one within two months 
 The Black Eyed Peas are the WORST group is rap HISTORY! Its hard to believe that anyone could make music worse than the Black Eyed Peas. This group is an embarasment to Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, and any other type of music ever created. How and why people continue to support these lame, extremely non-talented rejects of the rap world is completely unbelievable. I thought thier last CD was trash, but this has incredibly surpassed the low mark set by Elephunk, which should have been called, "Hey let'sell out and attempt to create the worst music ever known to man". The only good news is that theyll soon be forgotten about as they have just murdered thier musical careers, and will have to resort to doing jingles for commmercials in order to survive. These three unoriginal, talentless, boring, annoying, sellout, fake wanna-bes should stop making ANY kind of music and get completely out of the music business. Tonight I willl pray very hard that these bafoons of the music industry NEVER make another song EVER!!!! To say that they SUCK would be a compliment, they would have to practice constantly for the next 1,000 years THEN make a deal with the devil just to scrape up enough talent to suck! Theyre just that HORRIBLE!! 
 Sorry, this one gets added to my pile of books with titles such as "How they faked the 1969 moon landing" or "Curing cancer with Laetrile."  Written in 2004, the book purports to lay the blame for disasters, locusts, and plagues of any and every decade (both in the 1990s and 2000) on one or both of the Clintons. Obviously of a partisan nature, it will only be enjoyable to folks of the extreme right. Those wanting a more probing view can choose from more reputable and well-written titles which explore the same topic 
 Yes, the album title is quite appropriate because everything that made this band amazing on previous releases (the shining example being Determination) is far beyond gone.  God Forbid traded all of their originality for popularity and a new streamlined sound.  Gone are the amazing and catchy two-part guitar harmonies and the incredible breakdowns.  Gone are the amazing lyrics that used to accompany thier music.  Gone are God Forbid as far as I'm concerned.  I gave this album two stars for effort.  The band is still and incredibly talented band, and I can respect the risks involved in introducing clean vocals into music that used to have almost none.  The vocals are quite impressive, and the instrumentalists are still rather talented.  This album is far too streamlined and hackneyed for this fan.  If you want to hear a really stellar album, check out Determination 
 One of the single worst things to be published in recent history by White Wolf.  While the changes set down in Dark Ages: Mage completely ignored the time lines in the other mage series, it was atleast contained within the mage line. Demon the fallen on the other hand went further, it ignored the fact that demons have been used in every game, and those demons were not only better than the 'fallen' version, they are completely incompatable.  The changes put in this book sent the cosmology of other games into a tailspin, and not for the better. This was a badly done, and worse, unneccesary book 
 We were excited to order this book after reading the other reviews.  We have two adopted children - the oldest is now 4 and the youngest is 1 1/2.  We were VERY disappointed.  In its 33 pages, the book provided some nice art and a couple of nice sentiments in its 150 words - but nothing more.  While less may be more, there wasn't much value in this book for us.  We would recommend finding another book that would be more useful.  We're certainly still looking.. 
 If you are going to buy one of his books, get "When to Sell". This one was long, wordy, and tough to read the whole thing - looking for content. Lots of fluff. Could have used a good editor 
 I love jazz, really. But candidly speaking, Bud Powell's frog croaking vocalizations ruin just about every damn piece of music he's ever been involved with! I just want to strangle him whenever he starts that crap in one of his tunes. Why did he feel the need to do that? Didn't he realize he was destroying his music as he recorded it? I'm sorry to offend folks, but an idiot Powell was, a complete idiot. He blew it 
 I've had the pleasure of reading several dozen of the Star Wars Expanded Universe books.  This was the first one I actually had trouble finishing.  It is dark and throughly depressing.  If this is where the EU is going, I'm not following.  I'll stick to the books before this series in the chronology.  If you care about the Star Wars main characters, avoid this book and the series entirely. On the other hand, if you are a great fan of Boba Fett, you'll probably enjoy his return.  The expansion of his character was the only worthwhile part of the book 
 I made the mistake of buying this cd for one song basically. I would have saved some money had I just burn the one song that I like. The songs just really do not seem to flow very well together. There is too much down time between songs and too much talking. "Get Busy" is definetly the best song on the cd. I will admit I listen to it over and over and do not get tired of it. However, his newest cd "The Trinity" is much better. 
 I used to watch it when it have VHS long time ago. I love that movie. I thought of getting DVD to watch it again. BUT the negative thing is there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONED or SUBTITLE for Deaf, Hearing Impaired or Hard of Hearing people to watch it. It isnt worth it to buy it. 
 You only have to look at the poor cover design to know you're in for trouble here. I ordered this book just out of curiosity and am terribly disappointed.  The author has a formula for decorating that misses entirely. Good design isn't about formulas. And if it were, she breaks her own rules regarding focal points, balance, traffic lanes, weight on the bottom and much more.  The room layouts have no doors or windows which so affect the placement of furniture. What was she thinking?  She places two works of art completely to one side of the wall when two walls join going perpendicular to each other. So if one views one wall at a time as one would often do, the arrangement is totally off balance.  Huh?  Her teachings on the heights of furniture and matching it up with the height of the wall is a nice try that definitely won't fit many situations. There are too many variables that will conflict.   Her teaching that the art should be equally as wide as the width of the sofa or chair creates an oppressive feeling. The drawings that illustrate this prove my point: the art invariably overpowers the furniture below it which flies in the face of her teaching that the visual weight should be on the bottom, with lighter weighted items on top.  She would have you build a wall grouping from the outside in, rather than the inside out.  What?  She clearly doesn't understand scale and proportion and can't even find where she mentions it, so I guess she doesn't know about the Golden Mean Theory or the Rule of the Golden Thumb.  She tells you never to place matching loveseats across from one another when that is a very effective way to arrange them. And she doesn't want you to ever split apart two matching chairs, for instance, when doing so can open up an arrangement idea that is very stunning and just as cohesive as keeping them together.  I'm sorry but if you want your home to have the "Levitt's" or "department store look" with your neat little furniture "set" and no individuality, then you might like her inconsistent rules and formulaic decorating technique.  But if you want your home to look creative, distinctive, original, personal and just plain "feels good when done", a rigid formula is not for you 
 Hello, although this book is probably a classic book in fluid mechanics, I would have to say it is a bit advance.  I am currently a first year graduate student at Berkeley and I find that this book is not a very good reference to my fluid dynamics class.  To any mechanical engineering professor out there, choose a book that is a bit more elementary!! 
 While this may have been a good collection of essays at the time of its publication, it is now painfully outdated, retaining only historical interest 
 I heard this with a friend of mine the other night. My initial reaction was utter disbelief that something like this was possible. I thought I was having a nightmare of the kind you get after eating bad Dominoes pizza right before bed. I'm sorry, but when the classic lounge-lizard style and tacky big-band arrangements are applied to tunes like Smoke on the Water, Paradise City, and Enter Sandman, the result can only be described as a twisted surrealistic malevolence. On this cd, Pat Boone succeeded in weaving a twisted web of musical destruction with every note! Among the adjectives that came to our minds when listening included bizarre, vile, criminal, musical manslaugther, and aural malfeasance. On Crazy Train, you get backup singers who belt these "Crazy Train, Crazy Train, Choo-choo-choo" lyrics! Absolutely mind-boggling! I thought the entire universe was going to implode! Just what was going through Pat Boone's mind when he did this? Was he bored in retirement and needed something to occupy his time? Why didn't he just take up golf or shuffleboard or something? Why'd he have to inflicit this inflammatory drek on us for? It's too bad that we have no laws to put people in jail for such artistic malevolance! Listen to this cd a few times for some belly laughs, then stick it in the annals of your collection as it becomes one of the all-time whacky novelties in recording history.      
 Having read previous works on notions of blackness in America from historical figures W.E.B. DuBois, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglas, sociologist William Julius Wilson, and activist Angela Y. Davis, I started from a perspective that Dickerson's work would be at the level of these noted authors.  After getting through the introduction, however, I realized my mistake.  The work is not a scholarly compilation of syllogistic conclusions.  Rather, it is a work that Ms. Dickerson can confidently claim as her own.  Assumptions are based upon false premises that lead readers to conclusive arguments derived from erroneous logic. The thickness in verbage that includes slangy tone is rather demeaning as one sloughs over Ms. Dickerson's opinions that come off first as xenocentric but later are diffused.  
 This obsolete text has been forced on actuarial students for decades.  Time to get rid of it.  The book is grossly deficient in practical applications.  Yeah, it's called theory, but actuaries are supposed to apply the theories, not memorize them like so many abstract algebra concepts.  Buy the Schaum's Outline.  If you can find it, get the book from Butcher & Nesbitt that has been out of print. Completely superior. [...] Time for a change.  
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
 I ordered the Flying Bird Cat Toy.  The color combination they sent me was unbelievably hideous: Purple base and pale pink and pistachio green bird!  Their delayed response to my dissatisfaction was I would have to pay shipping back to them for credit.  Thus I would have two shipping charges to return this item.  Why would they produce an item that is so ugly, especially when their ad shows a lovely color combination?  Do not order from these sellers without clarifying exactly what you will receive 
 From time to time I read a book and dislike the heroine so much that I don't even care what happens to her.  In this book, I didn't particularly dislike Susanna but I just flat didn't "get" her.  A man is stalking her so instead of telling Jack, her husband who just happens to be a Texas Ranger, she packs up and moves from Texas to Boston.  Then, even though she proclaims her deep love for her husband she just can't bring herself to return home to him and instead puts down strong roots in Boston at her grandmother's house and even purchases an isolated cabin several hours north of Boston.    Her husband learns of the danger she is in and goes to Boston to be with her and once again she sneaks off from him...this time running to the cabin.  THEN, the woods around the cabin are crawling with bad guys, one of whom is a murderer and is also after her so instead of staying in the cabin where another Texas Ranger is there to keep her safe she decides to go cross-country skiing and surprise, surprise runs into the bad guy who, duh, tries to kill her.  Now there's a surprise!    Okay, call me stupid, but if my husband were a CPA and I had an accounting problem, I probably would ask for his help.  If my husband were a doctor and I had some sort of mystery ailment, I think I would ask for his opinion.  And if my husband were a cop and I had some really bad guys after me, I believe I would see if my husband could help keep me safe!    Like I said, I just didn't GET Susanna. I think Ms. Neggers intended to portray Susanna as being so strong that she didn't need her husband.  Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to understand that being strong sometimes means realizing when you need to turn to someone else for help.  If Jack had been a brain surgeon and Susanna had learned she had a brain tumor, I wonder if she would have insisted on showing how strong she was by operating on herself.  Guess this is a book I won't be keeping. 
 "The Accidental" by first-time Scottish novelist Ali Smith has to be one of the most irritating books I've read in a very long time.  It's so modern, it's really hard to tell what happened or why you should care about it.  This book won the Whitbread Novel Award.  According to another website, the Whitbread Award lost its sponsor and ceased to exist the same year.  Would it be fair to label this book as the one that killed the Whitbread Award?   The jacket also labels this book as a finalist for the Man Booker Prize whose website says that they award "the very best in contemporary fiction."  For me a requirement of the very best fiction is to be able to affect the reader in a positive way.  My only positive is that I finally got to the end of a dreadful book; & no, it did not get better.  Eve Smart is a novelist.  I usually try to avoid books where writers write about writers.  It's like a movie about movie stars or a song about songwriting -- it seems quintessentially self-indulgent.  Who knows what happens to Eve at the end of the book?  Why is she in some lady's house near the Grand Canyon?  Is it just to present another character as irritatingly self-absorbed as the main character?  Why is Eve unconcerned about her children?  Why does she see her dead mother floating above the Grand Canyon when this wasn't a book about her parents?  Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have her be eaten by a mountain lion?   Michael is Eve's husband.  He's a university professor that sleeps with his students.  His wife Eve knows and doesn't care.  Are they progressive people because they sleep around?  Is this supposed to make us care about them?  What is the effect of their loose behavior on their two children?  Do we care or applaud when Michael gets fired?    Astrid is the youngest child.  She is going through typical adolescent behaviors.  Yes, she is one of the most real of the characters, but she doesn't change throughout the book.  She gets mad at her mother for not being home and refuses to speak to Eve when she calls on the phone.  Astrid was right to be mad at Eve, but so what?  Magnus, the son, was the most interesting character to me simply because he loses his virginity in a church.  It's a bit of a mixed message from author Ali Smith.  What does it say about the church?  Is the message that "The Accidental" is man because there is no God proved because the church is empty?  Who knows?  Amber shows up as the family summers in Suffolk or Norfolk as Eve tries to write.  She buddies up with Astrid smashing her expensive camera.  She has sex with Magnus.  She insults Eve and gives her a knee massage.  She kisses Eve on the lips, right before Eve leaves for the Grand Canyon.  She ignores Michael.  Who is Amber?  Why is she in the book?  Magnus tells Astrid he knows who Amber is after she's disappeared, but Smith fails to let the readers know.  Is this a puzzle?  An illusion?  A nightmare?  Then when the family returns home, their house has been completely stripped.  Who did that?  What's the point?    I did not care for Smith's repetitious use of pages of short sentences.  It doesn't further the story.  It basically just says, "Look at me.  I can write in short sentences."  However, it was enough to have her awarded the Whitbread Novel Award.  I didn't mind the poetry.  I liked it because I could get through the book faster.  To what point it was there, I cannot say.  Perhaps you will be more modern than I and not particularly care if a story makes sense or whether there is anybody about which to care.  For me, this is an award-winning dud.  Taxi!                
 Not at all a good version of Dr Seuss's beloved classics... while I've seen the "point the camera at the book" type of production done well, this isn't it. The story is read in a long, dragging tone obviously meant to drag out a very short story. The producers also decided they were talented enough to re-write parts of the book, and fail miserably. While your kids may still enjoy this, for anyone who truely loves the pacing and colorful wording of a Dr Seuss story, you're much better off getting a copy of the book and reading it to your kids, than watching this pitiful productio 
 To be perfectly frank, I cannot help wondering whether the fifty people who rated this book five stars and called it the best they'd ever read, read the same book as I did.  I had to force myself to even finish it, and I've always liked Sinclair and the resolution of his arc in 'War Without End'. The story offers neither surprises nor tension, the romantic subplot seems forced, even distracting, as far as Sinclair's character development is concerned. What's more, for me Drennan's take on the events on Minbar doesn't even satisfactory fill the blank between the end of S1 and Sinclair's reappearance in S3; rather it makes it harder to connect the Sinclair at the end of the book with the man in 'War Without End'.      The style is flat and uninspired, the story-telling lacks B5's trademark subtlety, twists and emotional impact: every thought and emotion is spelled out in excruciating detail; the repetitions are endless: e.g., Sinclair's "the arrow that springs from the bow" metaphor is horribly overused in a way that doesn't even make sense.  MJS describes his wife as 'relentlessly logical' in his introduction, he also mentions 'late-night conversations, too many to number'. One wonders if the book might not have been better if its author had not been in such close association with B5's creator and had focused a little more on story-telling instead of attempting to logically tie up each and every loose thread.   If not for the fact that this is Drennan's first novel, it would have been one star.  
 You can't beat the price for this very colorful atlas with lots of pictures and graphs that kids will like, but it has a major flaw in that almost every map is split by the tight binding.  Information is lost by being buried in the gutterless pages, which makes the maps almost usless.  Hopefully, future Scholastic (and other publishers') atlases will be designed with a map on one page and the graphs, pictures and info on the other.  We had high hopes for acquiring such a reasonably priced atlas for our library patrons to use, and were very disappointed.  It's a shame to waste such nice resources on poor layout 
 I wanted to like this one.  I really did.  My son loves hand clap games and board books so it seemed like a natural fit.  He just seemed to hate the repetition in this one.  The sounds/words/rhythm are the same page in and page out and by page 5, he was acting like he does when I try to read a book to him a second time to avoid getting up to get another.  (He's seen it before and he knows it. 
 This is fun and a good idea, but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor.  It fell apart the first time we had it up, and while you can put it back together, unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds, it isn't worth it.  The keyboard itself is fine. The microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it, but the keyboard does.  The microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away.  I would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead, or if you buy this product, don't expect to use the keyboard stand for long, but it can work without it 
 Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Concise Ed., edited by Paul Burns, ISBN 0-8146-2903-2, Copyright 2003  Consider another book.  Despite "Butler's" being in the title, it seems to bear no relation to the Butler's Lives of the Saints published in the 1950s and 1800s.   Defects: 1. There is no index or alphabetical list of saints.  If you want to look up a saint by name, you have to scan the list of 366 saints in the table of contents, which is six pages long.  An index would have provided quick access.  2. Saints are not listed under their actual commemoration day. Why?  Because the saints did not "die on conveniently spaced dates" (page xi).  Nothing in the description of the saint alerts you to the date being wrong.  To determine the correct day, you have to closely read a paragraph at the beginning of the month.   3. The book does not bear an imprimatur from a bishop or "nihil obstat" showing that it's free from error.  To illustrate why this is a problem, one-third of the entry for St. Maria Goretti is not about her; it's a critique of her sainthood and of the Church.  Example: in "feminist circles ... Maria has been seen more as a martyr to patriarchal society" (p. 310) 
 Laminated maps such as this one of DC (where I live) are insufficient.  Get the big-sized paper map in a book store or you will wish you had.  The one here lacks details north of Adams Morgan's central district, for example 
 This CD is okay the first few times you listen to it, but it will grate on you by the 5th time. Some of the songs sound hillibilly and twangy, sing about topics that are not of special interest to kids, don't rhyme or are catchy, and don't teach anything 
 Another unnecessary tome of the "publish or perish" variety. It merely documents that the author has identified and consulted written accounts of the phenomenon from the last 150 years and patched together a narrative that is very much of the cut-and-paste variety. No original research is evidenced; and where the author had the opportunity to correct gross errors of fact in sources quoted, it's just too much bother. To wit: on p. 237, "La Goulue...still there in the 1930s... In the background..stands an old man...Valentin-le-Désossé, her old dancing partner." Well, La Goulue was dead by early 1929 (30 Jan. to be exact), and her partner Valentin had slipped back into the perfectly bourgeois existence that he emerged from - to die in 1907. On p. 246, Mrs. Wilson gives us two paragraphs on a "certain" Dr. Walter Serner (1889-1942). She appears to know nothing about him as a writer (of brilliantly unique short stories), but insists that he eventually disappears in the Soviet Union, "perhaps in search of the bohemian's always elusive utopia". This romanticizing nonsense is especially galling, considering that Serner suffered the usual fate the Nazis had in store for Jews: he and his wife were arrested in Prague in 1942 and murdered a few months later, probably in Auschwitz.  The author's website tells us that she has written an autobiography at age 45, and is a feminist, lesbian and social activist. I'd say stick to it 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 An hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable, but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay, there isn't much else. Granted, there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments, but it's often dull 
 For me, as an old Superman reader, i found the movie story very hard to "believe". The picture shooting and the special effect of it is master piece, wish Richard Donner has this same techonolgy in 1978. Why the story is so weak? First, it is not logical for Superman to leave earth suddenly without telling anybody specially Lois (And specially if their relation went to making love this time). Second, the reason of this disappearing, and what a reason, he knew from sciencetes that his planet, Krypton, MIGHT no be explode and there are some survivors, well, Superman doesn't need Earth People to tell him about his Planet, he could use his telescopic vision to check that and not to go there and check, under the red sun radiations. And if we presume that he went for this reason, why it took him 4 years to come back? ,....... no answer. Third, Clark Kent was absance too, for the same period like Superman, is it normal for Lois not to doubt in this matter, we all know she is the all time person who always think that Clark Kent is Superman, but now she even doesn't care of saying hello to him? ??? Fourth, why he need Space Ship to come back to earth? We all know that under the Yellow Sun, he gain all his power back. More and more, i can't believe when he can carrie a whole island of Kryptonite all this distance from earth to space, while he usually can't breath if he was under the radiation of the Green Kryptonite.  Well, this story suits children who are new to Superman. I think they should contact people like Alan Moore and Cary Bates next time if they want to make Superman Movie.    
 This book is terrible!  It gives different definitions for the same term several times in the first few chapters.  Why doesn't it just give one coherent, comprehensive definition for each word?!! The concepts are broken up and presented helter-skelter, so reading this book is like working a tedious jigsaw puzzle. Then it includes lots of problems at the end of each chapter, but there is no answer key, and the Solutions Manual is only available to teachers.  Do they think that my professor is too lazy or too stupid to make up his own tests? (Hint to oblivious writers/editors: a textbook is useless if students cannot practice working problems and check the answers on their own.  This is not third grade, and my professor is not a babysitter!)  I bought the workbook (which contains practice tests) separately, but I still don't have the answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. I will speak to the department heads at my college and beg them to switch publishers next semester 
 Really Really boring, don't think anyone should waste their time reading this garbage.  Horrible 
 I am reluctant to put much effort into writing a review about a entry level text. The information contained within is generic and simplistic. If you can distinguish between a hammer and a nail this book is not for you. I'm going to give mine to my 10 year old neighbor 
   I admit it: I saw this on a library cart and assumed from the cover that this was some political humorist on the order of P. J. O' Rourke or Jon Stewart who had simply not come to my attention.    How wrong I was.    Greg Palast bills himself as some kind of investigative reporter. He is not. He is a partisan who puts together a tidbit here, a tidbit there and fills in the blanks with left-wing cant taken from the talking point memos of a thousand fringe groups and special interests. What doesn't fit in with his agenda is simply ignored. Where a "fact" is vitally necessary, it is often invented.    Palast doesn't document his "secret" finds. Much like Seymour Hersh, another truth-challenged "investigative reporter", Palast expect you to accept on his own authority that when he tells you of this or that secret document that has come into his possession, you are to believe simply because he says it is so (ipse dixit, as the Latin goes).    The basic themes are what you would expect to find in any "progressive" screed: the United States is evil, Bush is evil and dumb, big corproations are evil and greedy, there are secret cabals that rule the United States and want to dominate the world and would, were it not for a few "freedom fighters" who blow up innocent women and children and so forth. We've all heard it ten thousand times and its no more rational coming from Palast than it is from someone else.    Two examples will suffice to show the blatant dishonesty of Greg Palast.    First is Palast's defense of Dan Rather's use of forged documents. Palast, without evidence, not only rejects the argument, but attacks the people CBS brought in to examine the entire fiasco. No evidence - just blast.    Next is Palast's attempt to misrepresent the work of M. King Hubbert, a geologist, on oil reserves. Even though he reproduces Hubbert's original chart, Palast simply distorts Hubbert's conclusions.    Overall, Palast simply plays to the crowd: those who share his beliefs. No proof is needed to support his contentions. As long as he casts the United States as evil and so on, all will be well and his books will sell well since the people who read them are not interested in truth, but in having their already existing beliefs reinforced.  Jerr 
 I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get "Born in Ice.&quot 
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 I bought the camera in May of 2006, as a graduation gift for my son.  He loved the style and compactness.  He experienced focus/zoom problems after 1 use.  Unfortunately he didn't start to use the gift for 2 months or I might have been able to return to Amazon for a refund.  Contacting Fufifilm has been overly cumbersome. Their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive (LONG WAITS).  They have had the toy camera (AS THIS IS BEING WRITTEN)for over a week and when I called yesterday for status, they told me that the camera "hasn't been diagnosed yet".  I expect it will be, once their 90 day warranty expires, which will limit Fujifilm's liability to the 1 repair.  I have a mean case of buyer's remorse.  I might as well have taken the ~$235.00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street.  If you own one and it doesn't require repairs, you might like it.  If it ever requires repairs, you might feel as I that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera.  Save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty, a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty.  You may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired.  I bought it in May of 2006....I feel like I lost it in July of 2006.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THE Z1 LESS THEN 1 STAR, I WOULD HAVE.  THAT'S WHAT IT DESERVES!   !&%$$##444EN FUJIFIL 
 This book was missing words and had typos 15 years ago. Since then there have been 3 major revisions to the dictionary. The last update alone had over 3200 words removed or added. By including words that have been removed such as DA and not including words that have now come to be accepted such as FE this book leads you far behind. Hook words like these make a huge difference when looking for good plays. This book is too outdated to be of any use to anyone looking to improve their game. Take the advice of the champion player who wrote the first review listed 5 years ago and get your info somewhere else. 
 I want to preface this review by saying the first three seasons of The Sopranos were probably the most brilliant pop culture moments of the past decade, maybe ever. Everything from the acting to the writing to the direction were just beyond belief, and I don't say that lightly, being something of a snob. Even the most minor of characters had more depth, more edge, than just about any other characterthe history of television fiction. In fact, I cringe even calling The Sopranos "television."  HOWEVER!!!! what the H is this Season 4 crap? I just bought Season 4 on DVD and within about two episodes I was frantically clawing at the box, trying to figure out what writers changed, what director changed, what, in general, made this season seem like a completely inferior imitation of the Sopranos. To my amazement, most of the behind the scenes staff remained unchanged! WHO is this sensitive, touchy feely wimp masquerading as Tony Soprano? And why is Carmella staggering around like a zombie, with ZERO of her usual charm and intelligence and humor?  I could go on but it's not worth the effort.  I read a review on here that said The Sopranos was supposed to end after season 3, and lots of money got thrown at everybody to continue the series. Yeah--it shows. There is no chemistry, None, with any of these people. I plan on selling this boxed set ASAP. I couldn't even finish it 
 And NO I do not agree that the lead female singer was brilliant. She has the same naisely "Disney Mermaid" qualities as everyone else of this generation. Not that I'm expecting Merman, but I grow so weary of witless lyrics and music, and singers who think "Linda Ronstant sings Gershwin" is a golden oldie 
 I have recently read 5 books about the Trappists/Cistercians and this is the worst book of them all.  I have spent 10 days on retreats at a Trappist abbey and more to come, and I DO NOT recommend this book for several  reasons.  First, the author has approached his subject as a journalist and  has a negative tone.  Secondly, he has included too much autobiographical  information about his own life and spiritual struggles.  Thirdly, he has a  rather arrogant attitude about his desire to invade the privacy of some of  the monks who choose not to be interviewed by him.  Lastly, his tone is  that of one being perched "on-high" and gazing down upon the lives of the  Trappist monks.  For a much better introduction to Trappist/Cistercian  monasticism: The Silent Life, By Thomas Merton; The Cistercian Way, By  Andre Louf; Trappist: Living in the Land of Desire, By Michael Downey; and  The Orchards of Perseverance, By David Perata.  I believe that these other  titles are much more accurate in portraying the spirituality and practice  of Trappist monks 
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 Lee Child is one of the best action-suspense novelists out there.  He is a writer of immense talent.  He normally writes in a very terse, no-nonsense style that really motivates the reader to turn the pages.  His hero Jack Reacher has become an inconic character, kind of an American James Bond.  DIE TRYING, however, is one of Child's lesser efforts.  The plot of this book is, quite simply, ludicrous.  All of Child's stories are admittedly implausable, but this one really strains credibility.  Much of what happens in this novel is statistically impossible, and I found myself rolling my eyes at much of it.  I've seen dumb action movies with better constructed plots than DIE TRYING.  Characterization is also quite weak here.  There are too many characters and Child keeps on shifting the reader's perspective from one secondary character to another.  All the villains in DIE TRYING are silly right-wing militia types.  Many of them are too buffoonish to be truly threatening.  Many of the action scenes lack emotional punch because you don't really care about any of the players.    Child also has an unfortunate tendency to describe every scene in minute detail, so that a straightforward action scene is drawn out to an interminable length.  In this book, this writing style really bogs down the narrative and made it difficult for me to finish this novel.  I skimmed this novel toward the end, which is too bad, because Child is a very smart writer overall.  My advice is to skip this poorly structured effort and devote your time to Child's better books like KILLING FLOOR and ECHO BURNING.  
 I had a devastating review here some time ago that was apparently deleted by someone. (Apparently, I wasn't alone. When I put in my review there was one with 4 stars. I fully expect this review to be removed eventually.)  In short, I enjoyed this book until I started noticing errors and a strange, sometimes nasty, bias. There are also several silly chapters on people who are simply not in the same league as the rest, a few that are extremely slanted and a few that are almost nothing but lies and misinformation.  It became apparent that the author tends to take sides. In more than one case he accepted the delussional rantings of the subject as fact, dismissing the volume of contradictory evidence. Worse, the author is, at times, very nasty in his dismissal of that contradictory evidence.  This is a sloppy, poorly written book. The number of egregious errors in several chapters make me doubt the validity of some of the assertions made in the rest of chapters. If you want to be educated, you are much better off finding books specific to the subject 
 I will be honest I like Dolph Lundgren.........a look at his filmography you see B.movie classics such as "The Punisher",Universal Soldier" and "Blackjack" Dolph has been going trough a slump.........Storm Catcher and the startlingly routine Jill The Ripper and the awful Minion(AKA Fallen Knight) but with Agent Red Dolph Lundgren hits rock bottom. Agent Red first of all steals it's music from Predator 2......and it's plot from Counter Measures,Oh I'm not finished yet. It steals footage from Storm Catcher!!!!!!!!! The scene where Jon Penner steals the  air craft while posing as Dolph Lundgren..........Now Penner is 5'11 Dolph Lundgren is 6'5 for goodness sake! yet they try to pass it off as Dolph Lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission.....This scene made me wanna throw up but I hung in there.....It turns out more footage is stolen.......I swear I saw footage from Iron Eagle  and Iron Eagle II.......I saw footage from Crimson Tide and I saw footage from Counter Measures........What the heck was Dolph thinking when he signed for this junk? I have no idea. When I was a teen (When Showdown In Little Tokyo came out) I thought Dolph Lundgren couldn't sink lower then Showdown In Little Tokyo,Then when I saw The Minion I was almost sure Dolph couldn't do worse........Well I pray he can't do any worse because Agent Red is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life..........This is coming from a guy who likes Don The Dragon Wilson. Bottomline:On Agent Red's cover it says "Once exposed you cannot survive"  Take this as a warning 
 ...and I can remember some of the scenes to this day (i'm 49 now). I was 16;my friend,17 at the time. I used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days,and after that movie, I didn't-for a long time. At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it. Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas."Horror-and-brutality technology" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 This is Martin Luther's Apocrypha not the original Apocrypha.  Learning bible history is important. It is ironic that book based religions like Protestantism forcibly deny that Jesus Christ and the Apostles used these books. Jesus Christ was a Jew. At the time of Christ, Jews had (1) God, (2) sacred scriptures, (3) temple, (4) bloodline and (5) high priests, as the formula for the covenant. The new covenant of the blood of Jesus Christ discontinued the need for a bloodline and everyone is now invited to the feast. The destruction of the Jewish temple and slaughter of all the high priests by Romans in 70 AD brought an operational end to the old covenant. See Hebrews 8:13. Fleeing Jews became a book based religion in order to semi-function without a high priest bloodline or temple. There was also a need for Jews to refute the validity of Christianity. Some 300-200 years BC the Jews had sacred scripture translated into Greek because Jews lost their original Hebrew language to Aramaic (the language that Jesus spoke). This Greek translation of sacred scriptures is known as `The Septuagint', or the LXX. Jesus and the Apostles used the Septuagint. What other sacred scripture could they have used? They could only have been using the LXX at this time. Taking the Septuagint with them in 70 AD Jews found themselves faced with problems such as the prophecy of Christ in their own books (which is supposed to be in there obviously). Christians then (and now) use these books as the case for Jesus Christ. In 70 AD some Jewish rabbis formed "The Council of Jamnia".  This Jewish Council came up with some ideas to both save their religion and to refute Christianity. So began the elimination of books from The Septuagint to form a Jewish canon and thus a canon of sacred scripture for their new book based religion (1. The books had to conform to the Pentateuch - the first 5 books of the OT, 2. The books had to be written in Hebrew, 3. The books had to be written in Palestine and 4. The books had to be written before 400 B.C!) Since Christians (the fulfilment of Judaism) had no need to reform sacred scripture or to even form a canon, they simply kept using the exact same books that Jesus Christ and the Apostles had used in the LXX. With the formation of the Christian Catholic Church the LXX canon was still maintained even though Jews in 70 AD changed it. Why should Christians change the Canon? If it was good enough for Jesus then it was good enough for them! A post-crucifixion Jewish council simply had no implication for them. If anything it was further proof that the Old Testament Canon did not need to be changed to support the testament for the Christ. Skip forward 1500 years and the protestant reformation started by Martin Luther decided to use a post-crucifixion Jewish canon. Why? There are many reasons. Firstly, Luther believed that since Jews changed, or created, a canon, that Christians should use this new Old Testament canon. The omission of books helped Luther to support his own heresies that these books refute. Luther confirmed his own OT canon. At the Council of Trent the Pope reaffirmed that the books post-crucifixion Jews and Luther removed where indeed part of the Canon that Jesus Christ used. The Catholic Church has never changed this canon. Never means never. That is why these books should not be called Apocrypha either. The Apocrypha are the books that never made it into the Canon and are a totally different set of books to the one's called Apocrypha here. Every catholic bible (New American Bible, Jerusalem Bible, New Jerusalem Bible, Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition) calls these books Old Testament, and rightly so, because they are and always have been. The only two groups to remove these books are the Jews at the Council of Jamnia and Protestant reformers. There is really no debate since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, affirming that Jesus and the Apostles used these books in the Septuagint. They appear in the Dead Sea Scrolls. To sidetrack this very important canon Protestants say that Jesus did not quote from them, but Jesus did not quote from many books in the Old Testament and he also quoted from many things in life outside of sacred scripture. They say that some translators (especially Saint Jerome) objected to these books being Canon (calling them deuterocanonical as opposed to protocanonical) but translators don't decide the canon. However if we are to find in the Gospels some reference to Jesus using these books then it can be found in Luk 18:31 "Then Jesus took unto him the twelve and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man." And especially Luk 24:27 "And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things that were concerning him." The scriptures are those found in the Septuagint, the LXX, not post-Christianity Jewish reform, not in the protestant reformation either. Let's be clear that the Roman Catholic Church has maintained the correct Canon of the Old Testament where Jews and Protestants have not done so. That is a major indication of why Christ wanted to start one church that would last until the end of time. Only the RCC (Roman Catholic Church) can correct the blunders of protestant reform and the deception of Judaism on this vital matter... and it does. Just flick though the table of contents of any of the bibles I have mentioned on this page and you will find that this so called `apocrypha' is in fact Old Testament... not to mention that Ethiopian Jews didn't bother with the recommendations of the Council of Jamnia and kept these books Canon. They still do 
 One day my gorgeous Russell Hobbs toaster went crazy. I started to research another nice looking toaster that would also satisfy my needs for a high-tech gadget. I thought the Breville 4-Slice Toaster met my needs. I didn't want the 2-slice because I thought that there were times that I'd like to toast long slices of bread. I read the stunning reviews for the 2-Slice and the mediocre reviews for the 4-slice, and thought "How different can they be?" Let me tell you, I bought the first Breville 4-Slice, put it on the '4' setting and ended up with charcoal. Actually, I ended up with a whole loaf of charcoal. I kept trying different slices, other kinds of bread, and even different outlets, but in the end, I figured I had a bunk toaster. However, when I exchanged the toaster for another one I had the same trouble. The toaster burned my bread everytime I used it above the '2' setting. Whats the point of having 10 settings? Finally, I exchanged the 4-slice for the 2-slice toaster. Perfection! Whoever did quality control for the 4-slice model--not so good. Buy the 2-slice and you'll be OK 
       Finally, "Making Love" is released on DVD. For those of you questioning my rating, let me explain. The ratings are supposed to be for the product (the DVD) not the film itself. I give the DVD a 2-star rating simply because it contains no extras. No commentary track, no "making of" featurette, no deleted scenes, no bloopers, no nothing (unless you count the trailer......and I don't count the trailer). The film I give a 3 1/2 to 4 star rating or a 5 star rating simply because Kate Jackson is in it.         Considered controversial and ground breaking for its time, today (as another reviewer mentioned) in the days of "Will and Grace" and "Queer as Folk" it seems rather mild by comparison. Still, that doesn't mean it isn't a good film. Yes, it is riddled with cliches and yes, it goes out of it's way to be as unoffensive as possible, yet "Making Love" tackles it's  subject in a fairly honest, forthright manner (especially when you consider it was filmed in 1982).          Although it's nice to see Jackson on Ontkean together again (since their days on the television series "The Rookies"), I never really bought Ontkean's performance. Even when I watch it today I feel he's too stiff and reserved, never really willing to open up and fully explore his character's conflicts and emotions. Jackson does some of her best work here (okay, so you know I'm a fan and somewhat biased but....hey, whatever). She has some genuinely touching moments, such as when she confesses her crush on her teacher to the camera ("Crepe paper is a [..] to tear"), when she talks on the phone with her father, or her final meeting with Zach. As he walks down the driveway and out of her life, the expression on her face breaks your heart. It's moments like these that make me very curious to see what Jackson could have done with the role of Joanna, the ex-wife of Dustin Hoffman's character in "Kramer Vs. Kramer". (She was originally offered the role but the producers of Charlie's Angels would not give her the time off). Harry Hamlin deserves kudos for taking a basically unlikable character and portraying him as such while showing the audience why he has built up this wall around himself. One reviewer noted that Zach unexplainably falls for Bart. I think it's perfectly understandable why Zach falls for him. Zach is in the middle of an identity crisis. Bart is the ONE gay man he actually knows on a personal level. It's only natural that he'd be drawn to him to learn more about himself, no matter how cocky or flippant Bart is.        So yes, the film has it's flaws (as most do) but I think it holds up pretty well after all these years. I just wish the DVD had some extras darn it!!  
 Towels are supposed to be absorbent, these swoosh the water across your body...Not good towels, pretty, yes- just for "show" though 
 Aweful.  Noisy, did not warm not to mention get hot.  Seller should scrap this product 
 This book is total self-propogating hogwash.  Garbage. Save your money, and your life, avoid this book like a big mac 
 I bought this book hoping that I could learn how to bead. But what I found is that book is far from complete and confusing in its instructions. A  major disappointment 
 This version does not have voice prompts to tell you directions or some of the other features you might expect. Microsoft now provides voice messages in version 2006 and it is cheaper than this version ($59-79 depending upon timing). It is worth the price if you have a laptop. Pocket Streets is disappointing. By the way, it is illegal to have your laptop open in the front seat in some states so don't get a ticket (they allow a normal GPS but not a laptop serving as a GPS...go figure).  By the way, Microsoft does not give a discount to upgrade from version 2005 to 2006 so your only choice is to purchase a new product at full price 
 Like a drag queen,this movie is melodramatic,wears too much make-up&is over-the-top.Watching this movie before going to work at 4 in the morning,I found this a hoot.(If this movie were in theaters,people would be in tears---from laughing so hard!!)  One of the gems is when Dolly's controlling boyfriend drawls,"A man is supposed to go after the younger ones,not the woooman!" Put on a fake Texas accent&it works.  There's the Sappy Sequence in which Dolly meets with her mother,looks at photographs of herself,then gets a heart-to-heart with her pastor.Awwwwww...Did Thomas Kinkade ever get directing credits?  Of course,one must suspend disbelief when the Handsome Young Guitarist falls for Dolly.For someone somewhere,they're an archetypal couple.I haven't found that someone.The movie has a hilarious love triange,enough melodrama for 10 Lifetime films--and songs to tie in with the plot,no less!It's country-fried soap opera!Come 'an get it 
 This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version. Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking.  These really make the movie crawl.  One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism.  Seriously, these little talks, take up 3/4 of the movie. The visuals are awesome, no question about that.  Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story.  Altogether, not much actually, HAPPENS during the movie. If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it 
 The Ying Yang Twins have really been a plague on hip-hop; they opened the doors for the D4L's, Dem Franchize Boyz, and Jibbs' of the world. Sure, there were wack emcees long before the Ying Yang Twins ever came onto the scene, but the entire 'snap' genre basically derived from the Ying Yang Twins; D4L and DFB can argue all they want, but neither created this sub-genre of hip-hop. The Ying Yang Twins did, and that reason alone is enough to condemn them to bargain bin sales.  Now, granted, I'm not part of their targeted audience; I'm a head who's grown up with the likes of the Wu-Tang Clan, Big L, Mic Geronimo, and Jeru the Damaja. However, at the same time, I'm not a certified hater of most mainstream hip-hop; there's a couple dozen commercial acts I can appreciate. Unfortunatey for Kaine, D-Roc, and most of all, myself when listening to this album, the Ying Yang Twins aren't part of that group. But, even the biggerst of Twin haters has to admit this music was made for the clubs, and no where but the clubs; and it was directed strictly at the women who love to shake their *sses. Granted, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, except for the fact that this album is a glorified doorstop outside of clubs.  At times, the Ying Yang Twins do show - believe it or not - growth. Live Again and Long Time(both back to back tracks) show they have their hearts in the right place; they just can't get the rest of their mind, body, nor soul there. Those tracks are two shining moments on the album, if only for the guest appearances from Adam Levine(who sounds at home yet again on a hip-hop release, oddly enough) and the soulful crooner, Anthony Hamilton. They also show that, at the very least, they can think of innovative ways to say the same damn thing, as on "Wait(The Whisper Song)" - the approach they took can be respected, but the lyrics are borderline retarded, even for YYT standards; come on, "beat the ***** up" being whispered nonsensically ten to twelve times in a row? This takes misogony to another level.  "Badd" manages to succeed on Ying Yang standards thanks to a guest appearance from Mike Jones(who nearly sounds average when paired with the Ying Yang Twins; quite a step-up!), and "Shake" is also your typical YYT song, with a guest appearance from Pitbull. To be perfectly honest, this is about your typical Ying Yang Twins album; which isn't a good thing. It's probably the best of their five released albums, but as the rating would imply, that's not neccessarily a good bunch. The few moments of sincerity, and original ideas save this from one star territory, but I still wouldn't recommend this to anyone other than a female wanting to shake what her mama gave her 
 Unfortunately, it seems to be an increasingly popular trend today to try and destroy the reputations of deceased screen legends who can no longer defend themselves. This is certainly not the first of its kind, and it's obviously not the last either (too bad!). This book has many brief chapters, each one filled with the worst scandals (abortions, adulterous affairs, criminal activities, etc.) of a specific female screen legend, such as Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, Lana Turner, Judy Garland, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly. Elizabeth Taylor, Hedy Lamarr, and several others.   The sections on Lana Turner, Greta Garbo, and Hedy Lamaar were especially infuriating, filled with rumors that even the National Enquirer would hesitate to print. For example, according to this book, Mickey Rooney and Lana Turner had an affair in the late 1930's which resulted in Lana having an abortion. Lana Turner already denied this rumor, and the very idea of a beautiful goddess like Lana Turner going for baby-faced Mickey Rooney is, quite frankly, disgusting and totally unbelievable. It also hints strongly that she had an affair with Clark Gable, although in her memoir she wrote that they had no chemistry off-screen. While some may find this kind of book entertaining, I think it's in poor taste. The book also describes Hedy Lamarr's orgies and bi-sexual relationships, and basically tries to pass her off as an arrogant nymphomaniac (the author does the same thing with Garbo).  This book quickly summarizes the screen careers and lives of these great actresses yet goes into great detail about their sexual activity (and preferences). Don't be too naive when reading about the many imperfections of these famous actresses. After all, there is some truth to many of the scandals mentioned, but there are also plenty of rumors that no one could posibly prove to be true. And after all, the author is merely rehashing what you've already read in previous books written by better authors. I suggest that instead of reading this trash you buy a well-researched biography. 
 This game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes.  Also, if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again.  It's a huge waste of money.  For 30.00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the DVD or have more than one DVD included in the game.   This is a BIG disapointment 
 I was excited when I purchased this ear thermometer because I had an ear thermometer years ago that I loved. I was unfortunately very disappointed with this one's performance. The temperature seemed innaccurate when we were testing it right after purchase. Then about two weeks ago my daughter came down with a fever. I could feel that she was burning up, but the ear thermometer read 97.5 when I checked it (twice). I got out the oral thermometer and discovered her fever was actually 102.1!!!       Needless to say this thermometer went back to the store. I won't buy another ear thermometer until I can afford to get a better brand, like the one I had years ago (ThermoScan). :o 
 The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however. 
 To be honest with you I thought the movie was really bad. the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky (Rodney Eastman) was in the movie. (for about 5 mins) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars 
 As a professional photographer, I found this book extremely disappointing. I purchased it because of the 'good' rating reviews I read under its title and the one good photograph which is on the cover. His lighting is terrible and his 'point of focus' using a macro lens, along with the compositions, make absolutely no sense. The only thing I would use this book for is to lecture on 'how not to do macro photography' 
 I was disappointed at the lack of practical suggestions and techniques. This book seems to want to inspire without giving specific practical tools and techniques on how to do it. This is not the book for me. I'll keep  looking 
 I, too, loved The Corrections, and being a resident of Boston, was eager to read this.  It read like a college freshman's attempt at a novel, and all of the Bostonian name-dropping felt like he had looked at a map and just chose to drop names of places.  The storyline is boring and I didn't like any of the characters. I want to read Twenty-Seventh City, but now I'm having second thoughts 
 This is just a way for Urban Dictionary to milk what their site stands for.  If you want to keep up with slang, an offline dictionary is not the way to go.  New slang is created and added every day on urbandictionary.com; most of it varies in importance, origin, use and documentation.  All together, this is not an appropriate dictionary.  Don't waste your money 
 Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book.  I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either 
 Marcuse has long been a favorite of intellectuals and for good reason - his ideas brought about the rise of the Left on college campuses and made acceptable the practice of allowing only acceptable views a hearing.  Dissenting opinions are to be silenced. His idea of societal/cultural Marxism seems slightly nutty and a tad romantic - one of those theories worked out by tenured professors over a second glass of brandy at the local pub. But Marcuse is anything but flippant - he is dead serious.  He is also a contradiction.  At once didactic (he's German)and eccentric, he also (like Freud) played the part of the gifted bourgeoise trapped amid a swill of nonentities. He has never refrained from advocating a dictatorship of the elite who would guide/help/force the stupid masses. For some reason, he thought undisciplined, nomadic students would lead that vanguard. And in a sense they did - by entering politics, academia or the media.  His disciples are classic "NPR" types - highly educated, white, well-heeled and immersed in political ideology.   One cannot underestimate his influence.  His theories led to several current movements (quote unquote): Deconstructionism, the Marxist interpretation of language, Political art, identity politics, group (gender/ethnic) over individual rights, the new Primitivism (radical environmentalism/animal rights) and last but not least, violence as an acceptable political response.    Despite the shrill denunciation of Western culture he chose to remain behind enemy lines, never venturing to Marxist lands for study where critical works of this kind would not be permitted. This is the paradox: Critical writers would not be allowed in a Marcusian society since "wrong" ideas are not permitted. Like Chomsky or Vidal or even the clownish Michael Moore, he walked among the very peoples he denounced.  The thesis of the book - typically Marxist - is the plight of the worker brought up to date by Marcuse.  We learn of the horrors of capitalism and the hope for a brighter future. But would his society of mind-numbing politicalization make individuals richer in spirit and more fulfilled?   One aspect of Marcuse I've always admired is his brutal honesty. Unlike other theorists he openly advocates violence when it is necessary to achieve a political goal.  He embraced the students who rioted in the 60's but unlike other letists he was never fooled by the common worker - they would never willingy accept his societal vision. He says (repeatedly) "They must be taught".  This work is very 1950sh, especially the parts with the outdated Freudian allusions.  It reads like a religious tract that quotes  ancient writings as the best answer for current problems. One must remember that this was written when Marxism was still taken seriously in some quarters.  Its effects remain with us today.   
 With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a "blind date" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.  What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.  Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' "Looking at America" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.  Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just "played it safe".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!  Grade: ** out of **** 
 Rather than write another review here, I will instead include the letter I was compelled to write to REA when I purchased this book:  I am writing to express my deep disappointment in your Physics Subject test GRE study guide. I found its review section inconsistent and incomplete, and the sample tests utterly failed to match the tone or content of the real exam itself.  As for the review section, it was disappointing enough itself. Your Temperature section spends its entirety discussing the different units used to measure the property. THIS IS NOT GRE MATERIAL. If a senior year physics student cannot change between Celsius and Kelvin in his sleep, I assure you, he has no aspirations of continuing study in the field. Frankly, he does not even have any business doing so. The rest of the Thermodynamics section suffers the same failing. The three laws of thermodynamics are the starting point for any college level thermodynamics coarse, yet they close your discussion of the topic. This book fails to purvey any of the complexities of this broad, interesting, and very difficult field. There is no mention at all of statistical physics, which is an entire branch of physics which is on the test. While this thermodynamics section was the worst part, there are many problems in the rest of the book. Optics ray traces are ambiguously and inconsistently labeled. The book does a poor job of differentiating equations that are part of a derivation from those which will be encountered on the test. There is no mention of inductance in the electromagnetism section, though I encountered this topic several times in actual tests (both practice and real). Impedance is also not mentioned in the circuits section. The quantum mechanics section is cut short with no mention of any of the kind of material that would be encountered in a second course, such as spin, angular momentum, and electron transition rules. Again, these are on the test.  Further, your sample tests did not match up well with my experience of the actual content of the test. The GRE is not designed to be a test of student's algebra. Numerical values are very rarely given for the relevant properties in a question. As such, students are tested based on knowledge of equations and unit analysis kinds of rules-of-thumb. However, your sample tests included numerical substitutions in most problems, and thus tested algebra abilities heavily. Students are not allowed calculators at the test, so time spent on calculation is wasted. In fact, I found that ability to test formulaic answer choices by unit analysis was one of the best approaches to novel or difficult problems. Had I relied heavily on your book, I would not have learned this.  I'm sure I could catalogue more important subjects that were missed, and find more confusing notation. Frankly, though, I do not have the time to waste with this book. Please realize that I understand that compiling the entire subject of physics in a single volume is a very difficult task. However, in order for a book to be worthwhile for GRE preparation, it must be much more complete and better organized. I consider this book a waste of my $28.95 and the valuable time I could have been studying more useful resources.  I write not to ridicule or be combative. There are not many physics GRE study guides available, and a good one would be tremendously helpful to those preparing for this difficult and stressful test. The inclusion of practice tests with explained answers is a great idea. This book does have potential, but it is not a good resource as of right now. It most certainly not "The Best Test Preparation for the GRE." I suggest a full review and rewrite of this book. I trust that, with some work, the REA can put out a study guide that is truly helpful to physics students. Please consider my encouragement to do so.  Thank you for your time 
 This books has lots of detailed information. However, I felt that it lacks code examples, explaining the textual descriptions 
 I've read this book twice now, and while I've gotten useful tips out of it, it really does read like a book report of the Inner Game of Tennis, frequently using phrases like 'Gallwey refers to...' and 'Gallwey says'.  So I read the Inner Game of Tennis and found that I could have garnered much the same insights from this book without the added and sometimes confusing editorializing by Mr. Green.  (And some of Green's additions just complicate things by giving your 'self 1' additional ammunition that it may not have thought of yet.)   All in all a useful book, but to do it over again, I'd skip it and go straight to the Inner Game of Tennis 
 I teach pilates/yoga (3 or so years) so I am always looking for a more challenging workout video. First of all, the title says level 2 but the DVD says level 3.  The workout is very dry, dull, and UNCHALLENGING!!!!!!!  It should be a beginners workout and can be done by clildren it is so unbelieveable easy.  I am sorry that I wasted my money to purchase this.  ALL the Stott DVDs are to the same dull format (2 people working out while one woman with a monatone voice rambles on and on about the exercise).  Please DO NOT purchase this if you want a workout.    
 If you are a fan of these great early Partridge Family albums, then you owe it to yourself to buy the 1993 Razor & Tie versions instead. Why? Razor & Tie did not tamper with the sound quality, as a result, Razor & Tie discs sound just like the records you remember. I made the mistake of buying the re-masters thinking they would sound even greater; NOT!  I've heard both versions using top of the line monitor speakers, and these Buddha discs have too much bass added for their own good. They also sound flat, because too much noise reduction was used, thus taking away the sparkle which sounded so good on the Razor & Tie versions. You can still find these Partridge Family albums on Razor & Tie right here on Amazon.   The Partridge Family albums on Razor & Tie were the debut album, Up To Date, Sound Magazine, Shopping Bag and The Christmas album.  
 I ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it.  It was terrible!  Tanya Holland is a beautiful Black woman, but I feel has gone too far out of the way to create "innovative and different" recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food.  The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook.  I collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others.  If you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent, your money would be better spent on "Essence Brings you Great Cooking" by Jonell Nash, "The Ebony Cookbook" by Freida DeKnight or "The Black Family Reunion Cookbook" by the The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in healthier soul food try, "The New Ebony Cookbook" by Charlotte Lyons or "The Family Dinner Quilt Cookbook" by The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in diverse, cultural flavors, I would recommend Vertamae Grosvenor's cookbooks or "Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons" by Jessica B. Harris.  I have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks.  They cover the gamut.  That is why I can give an honest opinion on Tanya Holland's book.  I just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average African American can relate to.  One that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking.  
 The first movie was an amazing film it had it all tension, horror etc. The second film was a slight let down. This film was a complete waste of time! It was rushed and parts of the story just simply did not make sense. For example the missing police man mentioned at the start of the film? The police woman who was killed by one of the Saw's machines? The whole thing just did not mesh together. It was obviously rushed and shows it. A real shame as this could have been a good film 
 This book is so whiny and self-indulgent that I am amazed that Wolf is actually a mother of two kids. It paints an unnecessarily bleak picture of pregnancy and motherhood, which are nowhere near as bad as she makes it out to be. The doctors and nurses and La Leche League and everyone else she complains about in this book are not out to get you, everyone is just trying to do their job the best way they can. 
 I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.  Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing 
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 i received this cookbook as a gift recently and was eager to test it out....i wasn't impressed really. there are very few directions as to the timing of each step in the recipes, and the recipes themselves aren't very fresh or mouthwatering...most are very "classic" items that seem quite dated, as well as heavy and unhealthful...some directions to recipes are overlooked completely, very confusing for a novice.. (which i am not....)  i use JOY OF COOKING all the time and will continue to do so, also MADELEINE KAMMAN'S MAKING OF A COOK (an absolute bible!) i do not recommend the NEW YORK TIMES COOKBOOK for any level of home cook. 
 While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.  I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.  Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear 
 This movie is offensive and probably would be beyond hurtful to children actually caught up in our foster/adoption system.  However, the biggest issue this film has is that it is totally boring.  Although the script was written with an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink mentality it fails to capture the interest of child or adult 
 FROM AMAZON.CA ---------  The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer (VGE)....or at least it claims to be. My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region-free DVD player and a memory card compression utility (squeeze more saves onto your memory card). I have not used either of these features personally, but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards; some reusable, some permanently damaged. This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it. However, the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I'll get to those in a second.  The ARMax, like the newer Gamesharks, loads its software from a CD. This is a major annoyance for me. Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card (which does I don't know what) and CD, go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load, choose your codes, then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load. You can't simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down. In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down. The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it. If you wanted it to load before the game, you turned on its switch. Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way (and it's not, btw), it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first. I mean, why can't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don't have to load the software EVERY D@MN TIME.  Ok, rant over. On to the codes. The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark. Functionally, they are very similar of course, but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use. It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions (not for user-entered ones though, if I remember right), and a more robust Expert Mode. On big advantage, in theory, that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2's broadband connection. The upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller. The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download; its all or nothing. And since these updates are stored on your memory card (not the ARMax one), it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99% of which you will NEVER play! No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card. It's to store all the useless codes! Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work, do nothing, or lock up the game. I have come across all, though to ARMax's credit, mostly the former. The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library, when you may want just one, loses the ARMax another star. A note about manually entering codes: The sub-headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game's code list.  Finally, as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols (Amazon.ca), the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL. This happened for me as well. I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions (at the time) of ARMax. I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected. Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine, I assume any bought today would not have this problem. However, at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally. Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site. This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars.  In my opinion, if you're in the market for a VGE, both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons. I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have. Looks at the specs, assume nothing, and don't be afraid to e-mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about.  I apologize for the length of this review, but I find there are very few in-depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print. Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs, I don't know. 
 So we just got this gift for Christmas for our 8 year old. Took me almost 10 minutes to get it to "lick." The review that mentioned rubbing hard helped. I shouldn't have to come to the reviews to figure that out. Once I got it to lick once I'm 5 minutes into trying to get it to do it again. Just WAY to much work. Not looking forward to Christmas morning and my 8 year old's almost assured disappointment 
 Peter Segal's "Anger Management" is a film with nothing going for it.  It is best described as boring, annoying, and devoid of laughs.  Mild-mannered Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding.  He immediately develops a problematic relationship with Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), the self-help expert leading the sessions.  As the two men spend more and more time together, Buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling.     "Anger Management" just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like.  It is essentially a one-joke film that wears out its welcome very quickly.  Sandler and Nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker.  Furthermore, the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings.  Truth be told, "Anger Management" is one of those projects that was green-lighted because of the talent involved and not because of its quality.  
 I love Holt McCallany, so anything he has done will naturally catch my attention. He is the lead in this movie, which is pleasant enough to watch, despite not being particularly extraordinary. The story is simple and a bit predictable, but the acting is decent and if you are a Holt McCallany fan like I am, you will love him in this one, especially the way he looks: absolutely sexy! 
 My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest 
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 I managed not to be able to finish this book.  I read through to the short story House of Cthulhu, were I shrugged my shoulders and set the book down.  The only merit in this book, is the introduction which is the only thing that has any Lovecraft feeling.  This is more like a Dungeons and Dragons collection of moral fables.  Every story was predictable and one that has been written better many times by many different authors.  If you have kids and they have an inkling towards fantasy then I highly recommened this book for bedtime story reading, as the morals will give them something to chew over, in a nice fantasy package.  All in All this is a dull uninspired fantasy mess, that gets you no where fast... and leaves you wondering if the people that made comments on the book jacket have ever actually read any H.P. Lovecraft 
 My father used Dobson's methodology as a license to strike.  If you wish to die alone in a nursing home, I suggest you listen to those who worship hate and violence.  There is not a day that I don't dream of lashing my old man with a studded belt to punish him in return, and am contemplating not having children to let the cycle of violence end with me.  God bless America, we really need it... 
 One of the above reviewers mentions the "bouncy" and "jaunty" tone of Gardiner's rendition.  This CD is so bouncy it sounds like a Baroque precursor of disco!  "Wachet auf" lacks the grand march quality in its opening and closes with a thin chorale. No full bass harmonies in the chorales. No stirring the heart toward rapture here!  "Jesu..." is similarly thin and too fast.  I regret buying this disk and doubt I will every listen to it again.  Bach chorales and cantatas should tingle the spine and shake the cathedral windows.  Gardiner's "Bach light" doesn't fill my family room 
 I was pleased to get the DVD as I have been trying to get it for teaching Greek Mythology, but I thought the actual packaging of the DVD rather poor especially for transferring to and from my class. The disc is not properly protected in my opinion 
 "Creative Retirement," by Rob Kelley.  Review.  This book gets off to a decent start by making the common argument that retirement without a "life" is not the way to go.  So, the goal of the book would seem to be to give relatively young retirees a resource of retirement leisure time activities that will lead them to a "life" in retirement.   The argument is made that retirement presents an endless cycle of 24-hour days that can lead to a disaster.  "The activities with which we fill those days will ultimately determine the quality of our lives," says the author, who also, without any attribution, tells us that the current average age of retirement in North America is 57.    The first advice we get from the book is to build structure in our retirement days.   But the advice is simplistic, at best: Go out once a day, make a daily things-to-do-list, plan ahead, exercise, and indulge your favorite hobbies are some, with "reduce your food intake" thrown in for some reason for good measure.   At this point, doubt about this book's contribution to the world of retirement advice is increasing, and, for me, things never get much better.  Of interest is an early point where the author makes the argument that there are no right or wrong choices in retirement and that happiness is defined individually.    But in the very next paragraph, he then tells us that we have only one life and if we don't get to all kinds of crazy things, we miss out big time.  Hmmmmm.  All this is followed by some chapters of general advice and information, including a questionnaire we're told is a "personal analysis of your current situation in anticipation of retirement."   We're about one-sixth of the way through the book.  The rest consists of eight chapters each of which describe 10 possible retirement projects for each of the eight personality types, e.g., organizer, socializer, nature lover or athlete.   In the "Projects for the Organizer" chapter, we get such projects as "Teach a Hobby Course," "Have a Garage Sale," and "Plan an Extended Vacation."    Projects in other chapters include "Find a Soul Mate," "Wrap Gifts for Charity," "Become a Golfer," and "Join a Dance Group."  While I'm sure that this format can work for some, again, it seems too simplistic and high-level to me.   Missing for me are stories of actual retirees in the project definitions.  But a positive is that there are 80 projects covered, most of which make sense, high-level, and most come with references to organizations, companies and/or websites for further research.         The book's back cover tells us that the book will "broaden your views on which activities are appropriate for retired people."    While that may be true, my feeling is that it won't broaden most folk's view by much, as most of the projects suggested are already very, very well known by just about anyone who already has any kind of a "life."     
 Upon receiving the book, the first thing I noticed was the cover as advertised on the internet is different from the actual book.  OK, I can live with that.  However, as I read the book, I found that It just doesn't live up to its subtitle; "A Complete Look At The Use, Care & Repair The 1911 Pistol".  In my opinion, it speaks more to Gunsmiths, and people already in the know, so to speak, than it does to someone interested in learning about the 1911-A1 pistol.   Unlike many other gun publication that educate the reader through words and pictures, on a step by step basis, this book jumps right into techical jargon that was very difficult to follow and for someone new to the 1911, I found this very frustrating.  Perhaps, for the reader interested in modifing their own 1911-A1 pistol, this book will be of some interest.  This is not to say the book doesn't provide some useful information.  Perhaps volume 1 might be more helpful.  
 I believe this book  makes a valid point for the pularity of companies today.  There are just enough tidbits to make the read worthwhile.  However,  I found the book frustrating.  The author suffers from disclipine.  He makes poor use of analogies and the book, while chock full of examples, could many times be examples of the contra opionion: diversification.  The author would benifit from application of scientific rigor that would add depth and credibility to his copious but superficial use of examples. Perhaps exploring a corporate strategy of diversification would of given him the credibility I needed to swallow all his claims.  Without it he comes off as someone who makes up his mind what position he wants and then grasps anything possible to support his ideal. For those interested in the subject I relay the maxim, "Concentrate when in control otherwise diversify.&quot 
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 Nothing on the end of Voyager's Delta Quadrant wanderings?  Nothing on Enterprise's backstory additions and newly-created anachronisms?  Both this book and the related Star Trek Chronology need serious revamping.  I appreciate the Okuda's insider Trekker style, but this reeks of willful blindness 
 Grim Tuesday was just a remake of Mister Monday. The whole plot is the same- Arthur must find his way into the House and navigate his way to Tuesday's key. The story moved very slowly and did not hold my interest well because I was not particularly interested in any of the characters. Arthur has no special abilities that would make me like his character. He is just a boring, normal boy who follows orders from the Atlas. Suzy Blue is an annoying character with very little appeal, and all of the members of the House are like robots with no real impact on the novel. I couldn't finish the book because of the monotony and I don't recommend it to anyone who likes a fast-paced book 
 I order the 2004 artist market an good this 1994 artist market. they will not refund my money 
 I didn't read the passage that the other reviewer did, who stated:  "Did you know that if you start a business from your home, everything you currently own and use for the corporation (tables, computers, chairs, etc.) can be considered a donation to the corporation, resulting in a write off on your individual tax return? You can even write off your rent if you operate from there!"  But assuming his citation of the book is accurate the book is flat wrong.  A contribution by a shareholder to a corporation in a 26 USC 351 transaction is NOT A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION and IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE by the contributing shareholder.  Moreover, one cannot contribute assets to a corporation in exchange for stock, and then cause the corporation to make a 26 USC 179 election with respect to the contributed assets.  Merely operating a business inside corporate solution is not a silver bullet for tax savings.  Nor, as some will claim, is forming a NV corporation 
 Well, I was also disappointed that certain songs were missing on the soundtrack. I do not however think it's fair to say this is a CD only for Blacks because it's all rap! That's ridiculous. But, I'll overlook that naive comment & say, even for those of you who do like hip hop, there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing. I loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one (Let 'em Fight?). That's the song I wanted the soundtrack for & I was so disappointed. As for those of you interested in that Lynyrd Skynyrd song playing during the car chase, it's called, "Saturday Night Special." The soundtrack wasn't bad, just a disappointment. To see all of the songs that were played in the movie, visit: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398165/soundtrack 
 I bought this book(cheaply thank goodness) thinking it would be an interesting memoir about selling on ebay. WRONG--it is nothing but photographs of the author's boring junk with small captions so we can all read the cutesy descriptions he wrote for ebay. About 60% of the items were purchased by his friends or people trying to help with this "project".  Save your money--this is just pictures of dirty old clothes and canned food--not one interesting item--with very little commentary, most of which is self-conciously "hip" and cutesy.   I'm really sorry I wasted my money, but you don't have to 
 The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many "high level" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge 
 It is quite complete. The main issues are all there. And it isn't too difficult to follow. But the structure does wobble a bit. It also fails to galvanize the reader. It is a bit of a sleeper since it just presents one technique after the other. No sparkle, inflection nor much motivation. Right now I'm halfway through (chapter 6) and I will finish it, cause the subject matter is all there. But I wish I had another book to choose from 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 The plot sort of tumbles out of the story rather than unfolds. Ms. Zukas is the sterotype of what people perceive librarians to be, she also seems to have some obsessive-compulsive traits. Ms. Zukas should have been the third victim, since the only compelling character in the story was Ruth 
 Are we parents so desparate for Hollywood to acknowledge the subject of Aspbergers or Autism, that we'll accept any trash they put out???  This movie is filled with nasty language and predictable, tired stereotypes that do nothing to show the interesting differences each affected person has.  What a shame.    I wish there was an option to award 0 stars for this.  One was too generous.  
 I picked up this memoir based on a blurb that mentioned the author's connection to the Stratford, Connecticut Shakespeare festival. Having had a single opportunity to attend this (Christopher Walken's Hamlet!) event, I was hoping for some insight and history of the event. Instead, I found out far too much about Smith's problems; of his difficulties coping with a family that was overwhelmed by having a severely disabled child in the home (Smith's sister), and very little about Stratford's festival. Well, shame on me for buying into a blurb, but I still found the book very disappointing. Focusing basically on his youth, and his later contributions to the community by running Shakespeare reading groups at senior centers in NYC, HAMLET'S DRESSER, needs far more Shakespeare. When Shakespeare does appear, the book comes to life. The joy senior citizens get from the reading groups, Smith's fascination with Shakespeare that led to a life immersed in his works, and especially in the sections where Smith discusses the actors he had an opportunity to work with is where this book truly becomes interesting. Katherine Hepburn, June Havoc, and Bert Lahr all make memorable appearances. The chapter where Smith discusses going on tour with Lahr gives the reader a wonderful glimpse into what it is like to work with a talented yet irascible actor on the road with all of its joys and pitfalls. Sadly, there are not enough of these journeys in this book. I feel some empathy for Smith's trials and tribulations, yet they didn't make for interesting reading. The troubled tales of his youth seem better suited to a therapist's office as opposed to a memoir. They truly pale in comparison to his tales of the theater, which when shared with the reader make for some fine storytelling. If the focus had stayed with Shakespeare and the theater I feel this could have been a wonderful book, as it stands it is a flawed a bit boring overall 
 This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all 
 I have recently read this book, and I have to say that I'm less than impressed with it. When I started it, I was pleased and relieved that it was so easy to read and entertaining, but after a couple of chapters of Eagleton's witticisms and biting humor, I found myself waiting for the "theory" to kick in...and it took him until the last three chapters. The book seems to be primarily a rant directed against capitalism (i.e.-the United States, though he does make a tiny disclaimer about this in the postscript), and while it's not surprising coming from an alleged Marxist, it does eventually begin to wear on the reader--at least on this reader. He has good points, but After Theory really feels more like a soapbox for a fist-shaking rant than a discussion of the decades that have comes after literary theory's "golden age" of 1965-1980. I was really hoping for more out of this book 
 I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed 
 Many years ago I enjoyed reading Ivins' columns but unforunately her brand of independent liberalism has turned into just another mainstream media voice parroting the Democrats. Her personal hatred of George Bush has become distracting and embarrasing. Strangely enough she reminds me of Rush Limbaugh. When he began doing political commentary on the radio Limbaugh was an independent with a conservative streak and was comfortable attacking Republicans. Similarly Ivins was originally an independent with a liberal streak who was comfortable attacking Democrats. Now Limbaugh is as firmly ensconced in the Republican camp as Ivins is in the Democratic camp.  What a shame 
 The subject of the book is interesting but the writing style is vague and very circumstantial. What can be said in one sentence is explained in one or several paragraphs and what can be explained in one paragraph is said in a chapter or more. You don't want to put some books down once you piced them up. This book is the opposite; you cannot wait to put it down. It is very boring to read.  
 We ordered this bed for our miniature dachshund.  She was very interested in it but, every time she crawled in, it would tip over when she got to the back to turn around.  The sides were just too rounded and she couldn't get out without help 
 Like many others, the arm on my 4 year olds excavator broke as well  Who can we contact for help?  There is NO information on the box 
 After seeing some of the other Amazon reviews of this movie, and the fact that Jason Swartzman was in it (after having seen him for the first time in "Rushmore" - a wonderful film), I had to purchase a copy of this DVD for myself to view.  It's got a wonderful cast of fine actors, but I found this movie really dumb.  One critic on the DVD box claimed this was "Laugh Out Loud Funny."  Really?  What movie was he watching?  I strained a chuckle here and there, but that was about it for me.  The Lily Tomlin & Dustin Hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script.  I know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie, but I didn't find much to snicker about.  
 I purchased this and regret it.  The translation is from the early 20th century and this volume is from one of those discount publishers that use writing that has fallen out of copyright.  They don't even disclose who the translator is -- but he or she did a poor job.  Much better is to purchase Hollingdale's translation (or probably any modern translation) of the Untimely Mediations.  Use and Abuse of History is the second essay in that volume.  The work itself, of course, is incredible.  This review is about the translation 
 'Advances in Agronomy, Volume 73', left me bewildered. Nowhere in the text did I find reference to the well-researched fact that those who practice agronomy, and who have been convicted of it, are usually recidivists who can never be rehabilitated. So therefore, how has the topic been advanced? Society should be protected from agronomists and their vile deeds. I might sound harsh, but I say that all agronomists should be locked up for life and rendered hormonally inert through the administration of impulse-destroying chemicals. 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
 I bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch - for swimming and running.  Unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming, is unbelievably bulky, and has this strange time setting system which only works in the USA and Europe (I live in Australia). In the end I gave it to a relative in the USA 
 I just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere.  Unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player.  Earliest date I can find one is 10/23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs.  I'm at a loss now that the battery is dead.  This is the dumbest idea ever.  Why didn't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player?  I agree that you should order a back-up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 I must say I am disappointed.  I was looking for a book for the amateur gilder, and I got a book for the gilding hobbyist.  This book teaches you to gild objects around the home (i.e. picture frames, tassels, and yes--even a toilet seat), but does not go any further than that.  For the purposes of gilding as a hobby, this book is complete.  For the purposes of practical gilding (like sculpture, architecture, and wood work), this book is lacking, and there is nothing in the book's description or title to suggest as much.  So, be warned 
 Tour de France: Companion 2005 implies that you will be getting a guide to the race for 2005.  If that is your expectation, you will be disappointed.  Of the 184 pages, almost 5 relate to this year's race in what is hardly more than cursory detail...  There are no profiles of the stages.  There are no individual stage maps.  There are no descriptions of the routes and the challenges they pose.  The authors, it is clear, have not taken the trouble to follow and scout this year's route.  They did not follow last years either would be my guess, nor will they next.    The cover of the book promises to provide a 2005 crib sheet.  If the reader expects to pass a test based on the promise of the crib sheet, he will get a failing grade.  Look elsewhere if you are interested in information regarding the current Tour de France 
 I ordered this book and eventually amazon cancelled the order because it was not available.  The then ask me to review it?  Where is it?  Rev bruce 
 Has America gone completely mad? A previous reviewer states: "Rod has outdone himself on this one." Huh? Did she really mean that as a compliment? I've come to the conclusion that nobody under sixty years of age in this screwed-up contemporary society, in which mediocrity reigns, has any idea what a great pop vocalist sounds like. The songs included on this travesty of a cd are standards, classics of jazz-pop. Listening to Stewart mangle them with his phlegm-saturated gargling must have Mildred Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra, etc., turning over in their graves. Stick with the few remaining major leaguers like Tony Bennett and Vic Damone---even in their eighties they sound lightyears better than this sandpaper-voiced human vegetable. Or check out the newer generation of pop-jazz crooners like Michael Buble, Harry Connick, and Peter Cincotti. They are infinitely better singers than this guy. My God! I can't believe that some people truly think this guy has talent! What's next---- Joe Cocker sings Caruso?  
 Breathnach's Simple Abundance and gratitude journal changed my life. I am in a temporary apartment awaiting closing on a home in a new state when I cam across Moving On. I couldn't wait to delve in. It seems quite stream of consciousness and more self help for Sarah - if readers find it useful that may be a bonus rather than the objective. You will find pearls of wisdom. But you have to dig through Sarah's written clutter to find them, all while she hopes to motivate us to rid ourselves of home clutter.I am on pg 157 of 269 and what is helpful could be distilled down to a magazine article. However, if you wish to commiserate with disappointment and unhappiness, you will find Sarah good company, despite her success and recent marriage. 
 This book sounded great from the review and abstract, but it was a complete let down. I did not even finish it, therefore, you would be justified in nixing my review of it, but I did read most of it and it blew. It's not that I didn't agree with what it was saying, I just did not find anything new or refreshing in its content 
 I really disagree with the other reviews so I had to write.  The main value of this book is the sample questions.  Come to find out - the writers did not even bother to change the ORDER of the sample MPRE questions available for free on the MPRE website.  What an insult.  Furthermore, I thought the lecturer was a total zone out bore who did nothing more than read the too-abbreviated outline.  Don't waste your money on this book.  Just go to the free test on the MPRE website, and use the Emmanuel flashcards - which are way more comprehensive 
 "When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'.  
 I don't normally do reviews on items because I am aa easily pleased person. But, I had to do this so that other people don't make the same mistake I did. This book is awful. The disk has tons of forms ALL of which are either bogus writing which is hard to undersatnd OR are TOTALLU useless. Plus, they are done SO POORLY that a high school student could create a better document.  The book is nothing but forms and fruity language. It really gives a BAD name to the coaching profession. I think it is a noble life path and I happent o be on it. After reading this I am afraid to think that some coaches use this as a guideline for their work. If my coach spoke this way to me I would be offended and feel like I was being used for money.  I HOPE THAT NOBDY WHO SERIOUSLY CONSIDERS BECOMING A COACH USES THIS AS ANY SORT OF A GUIDE! 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 Bill O'Reilly ought to stick to what he does best, i.e. making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon 
 Who wouldn't want to star in a movie they write and direct. Who wouldn't want two attractive women to fight over them in the story line. If you have the money and can make the movie, why not? But PLEASE keep your adventure into egotism to yourself. 1.) The star can not act. 2.) The director allows this film to go overboard and loses control. 3. The writing is so filled with such swagger and egocentric dialogue it is as if the writer is screaming "LOOK AT ME I AM FUNNY AND CLEVER!!!" I am sorry to say you are not. And what makes this worse, the writer, director and star  are all one person. This movie could have been saved if the star/writer/director put a talented attractive (I am sorry but you have availed yourself to critics) actress to play off the two supporting actresses (who can act and are quite attractive)....Of course you would still have the dialogue but it would have been easier to watch.  I hope it was worth the money to stroke the ego of Ms. Lesnick (actor/writer/director), but please you would have been better off donating the money to charity. I imagine she is an actress/writer who can not figure out why she can not get work, so she decided to hire herself. Who now can say "LOOK AT ME I AM A STAR OF A MOVIE." The trouble is if she saw the dailies each day while filming she should have fired herself 
 For those of you whose children grew up with "Conjunction Junction" and other Grammar Rock songs, it is probably  time for you to buy this DVD set for your grandkids! This collection has all of the songs that you remember (and probably some that you don't!) I recommend playing it on your computer for easier navigation to the videos that you want to see. I do not recommend downloading the software that comes with it. It was quite difficult to navigate. Simply use the media viewer that you already have installed on your computer. I really give this product 5 Stars; the 2 star rating was an accident that I can't remedy. 
 A great drummer, an excellent guitar player, and a terrific bassist combined with the hottest producer around would lead me to expect something something really great. Unfortunately the material lacks originality and the vocalist is as limited as I feared he would be when they selected him.  Butch Walker seems to have squeezed all the fire out this record and Lukas lacks range and sounds thin and weak at times.  This is just another hard rock record that has lots of the right attitude but lacks anything special 
 His view of God is fluffy and New Agey.His relationship books I thought were bad enough but this book comes across as though he has some secret information about spiritual matters,,not!! He repeats himself about getting connected with God,and to me it sounds more like "God source" as many New Agers say,rather than God.More like God source within you,eh,this is too much! I agree with the other reviewer who said it's about self  promotion.Seems like that to me too.It's kind of a funny book, ok for a good laugh I suppose but not for seriously looking  for religion or God 
 This book was delivered many weeks after ordering.  Although the original order showed a shipping date between X and Y, I thought it was just a CYA in case of a shipping delay.  I did not know that Amazon did not have this item available for immediate shipment. Amazon's price seemed a balm for the delay however. 
 The topic is an interesting one and I give the author credit for trying to pick out key themes across a very broad and complicated landscape.  However, I found the book frustrating and annoying in a number of ways.  Most importantly, the book never manges to find and develop a theme; it seems to meander from topic to topic. In addition, the author is far too enamored of simple computer models and spends too much timing belaboring how they work, their iterations and marveling at how, with the right inputs, they can show outputs similar to what is observed in real life.  In addition, much of what appears to be the point of the book hinges on the assumption that the extinction of a species is a failure similar to a company ceasing to be a separate stand-alone entity.  However, firms disappear for many reasons other than bankruptcy - for example, I don't think the stockholders and employees of Pixar thought it a failure when it was acquired by Disney.   Less significantly, while Macbeth is a great play and Evelyn Waugh a great novelist his attempt to weave his many literary loves into his theory is awkward and clumsy.  He also touches on interesting topics (the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, the pros and cons of monopolies, evolution, the introduction of New Coke, the correct strategy for playing The Price is Right) but only provides superficial commentary that is very unsatisfying.  Finally, he has a habit of stating the obvious as if he has made a great discovery (two car company representatives expressed great confidence in how their product lines would perform but the third said the outcome would depend on how costumers liked the product - could it be possible that companies aren't certain about the outcomes of their actions?  Could it be that companies must make decisions and those decisions could turn out to be bad decisions?  Should Paul Ormerod give his acceptance speech in Swedish, or would English be acceptable? 
 I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 The interviewer is very annoying.  At times he interrupted Jerry's answers, finished Jerry's sentences and blabbed on about his own ideas 
 I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee.  I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again... 
 The denying of the Armenian Genocide is the ultimate final chapter of the history of that and any Genocides. What is happening in Iran today to "redefine", "rewrite", the Jewish Holocaust is the same act that the Turkish Government and its hired workers like Guenter Lewy, Heath Lowry and Justin MacCarthy are doing for a very long time now. While on the other hand, that same government persecutes any Turkish author or scholar who dares even TO UTTER the word "Ermeni Soykirimi" in Turkey.  If Lewy and literature gangsters like him are allowed to defame the memory of millions of the 1915 Armenian Genocide dead and the massacre medleys that came before it between 1984 and 1909, despite the overwhelming amount of evidence to show its truth and reality; why then one should not honor people like Fredrick Toeben, Robert Faurisson, Georges Thiel, David Duke, David Irving, who defame the sacred memory of millions of Jews and other minorities who perished in the death camps of Aushwitz, Treblinka and Sobibor? Then what in the hell is the difference when people die en-masse in those mentioned camps, and in the Turkish Geovernment planted camps of Deyr-Zor, Meskene, Raqqa, Haseke, Margadeh and other places between 1915-1918? Has Lewy and his denying gang seen any Armenian woman who was gang raped to death? Any Armenian priest being burned alive? Any Armenian child who was torn from her mother and her skull crushed in front of her? Those who were mass suffocated, hanged, shot, stabbed, and drowned? Have they been there..?  If one says that the Armenian Genocide is not.. Then one can dispute any Genocide... SHAME ON THEM ALL.  Even Turkish scholars like Akcam, Pamuk, Gocek, Shafak and many others, share that same feeling... 
 I wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool.  This program does not do well with fixing red eye.  Software did not come with a manual. I am computer literate yet I found this software not easy to navigate. I found HP Essentials which is a free download from the HP website to be a better program. 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 I have to say... all the CGI movies I have watched have all been top-notch as far as story goes. I'm talking about Toy Story I & II. Finding Nemo. Shrek. etc. etc. I realize this wasn't made by the same company as Toy Story and Nemo... but it IS from the creators of Shrek. Therefore this movie fails. The animation is good, yes. But the jokes are empty. Nothing is really funny at all. The story is almost non-existant and had no real direction.   In my opinion, this movie was a waste of space. In everyway possible. Shame on you, Dreamworks. Shame on you 
 Four months ago, I used this product and had no problems except the finished CDs did not play in one person's car player. With this stack every one of the first 15 CDs I made did not play in most equipment, although they played in the recorder where I copied them. It was very disconcerting to put them in other players and get nothing, or get something only after forwarding to the 3rd track. Didn't understand why this was happening. But I'll not buy them again. It was a waste of many hours since I was assuming they worked 
 This book was used as a text in my philosophy of music class.  The professor chose the text because she knew that we would be opposed to his views.  He barely deals with vocal music at all, claiming that it is not "pure music" because it has text.  When dealing with opera, he feels the "problem with opera" is the fact that it is not cyclical.  He mentions that when opera was first introduced that emotions were thought to be cyclical, and opera to the best of it's ability tried to accomidate that.  However, it the mid 18th century that was discovered not to be the case and it was realized that emotions are linear.  Just because the history of music has cyclical background does not mean that with this discovery it should remain as such.  Linear and cyclical writing are tools used by a composer to convey certain emotions or to help define an event.  Overall I felt Kivy was too verbose.  If I were not a music major, I would have found it hard to truly understand what he was talking abou 
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 I didn't want to spend a lot of money on an Ionic Hair Dryer.  I came across this one and thought I'd give it a try.  The light indicating the Ionic Generator is working stopped working after its first use. What a waste of money! 
 What a rip-off....I agree it is the first comic..but sure is not the best value for your money.  
 Nice addition to all what is out there but as stated before a lot of mistakes in accuracies. I have other books from Jim but this one was a little bit of a disappointment. 
 'If these walls could talk' was dissapointing. It was too disjointed for me to gat any real understanding of the message. I would not suggest any of my peers to purchase the dvd 
 This is my first Denise Austin workout video and I will never buy another one!    I'd expected someone as established as Denise would take the time to properly teach the routine to her workout crew and be sure they've practiced enough times before making this into a DVD and charging money for it.  Everyone continuously messes up their moves which drives me absolutely nuts.  Possibly I'm too picky, but regardless of how good of a workout this is, the misteps of the people distracts me from getting a decent workout.    
 Gary Paulsen's,My Life in Dog Years, is about all the Dogs owned in his life. Gary owned the dogs since he was a toddler to a fully grown adult.One of the dogs Gary owned was a Great Dane called Caesar,he was gentle and gigantic.As you'll read this you will understand why these dogs became so special to him in many ways.This book also has funny moments like when Dirk,the tiny watchdog,Gary owned when he was a child bit someone's pants off because Gary was being bullied.Emotional moments are also very common in this book like when  some dogs Gary found were missing,abandon,and lost.Reading this book will be easy for the young ones because they will understand how Gary feels about his dogs.An Audience older than 14 wouldn't be as interested.Overall this book has some short stories, were a reader can't get lost.I would recommend this book for an audience under 14 
 Short and not so sweet: First unit did not work at all, Second unit worked for about 3 months, then sporatically, then quit. I should have believed the other reviewers. Going to try the Senseo Supreme unit now 
 I'm usually a fan, but this is a book in which nothing happens, and in which that nothing is truly surprising mainly for its predictability 
 Titon unquestionably knows his subject matter well, and this does come through in the book. Unfortunately, he drains the topic of all the spontaneity and joy that one associates with music with a pendantic and tendetious approach. His writing style, in my experience, aptly reflects his personality. I once took a college class from him when he served as a visiting professor at Carleton College in Minnesota. This book was a mandatory assignment...more royalties for the professor. If you are prepared to take the subject as seriously as Titon takes himself, this book could be for you. Otherwise, there are surely more accessible and informative works to begin a study of this distinctively American musical form 
 What ever happened to common sense? In this book the average American doesn't exist. I am not denying the problems that exist in the inner cities. I am denying that this is life for the average American or even the average non-white American. Comparing two extremes - best case vs. worst case is always going to give you an unrealistic picture. We live in a capitalist economy, there will always be haves and have-nots. What he is pushing for is a socialist or communist system where everyone is equally miserable and those that manage to get ahead are then forced to pay the way for those who can't or won't. Hey Mr. Kozol - last time I checked there was no army on the borders of Camden or East St. Louis keeping people from moving out, and there is noone forcing anyone to accept the lifestyle they were born into. He offers a view of the problems with no real solution except maybe to hate the rich - Mr. Kozol, how much money did you get paid to write this book?? Utter liberal garbage. Conveniently leaves most of American schools totally out of the equation, only focusing on the worst cases and then comparing them to the top schools in the nation. 
 i love this movie ,so it pains me to give it two stars but really other than the gore and bad acting,this is one of the worst!!! only for gore fans(like me),other wise stay away!! 
 This is a really, really, really, really, bad movie. Don't watch it, don't buy , don't even think about this movie, you may get brain damage. Acting is horrible, plot line is ridiculous, and who...wrote this terrible script. Ghetto people don't even talk like that 
 This book was rather fun to read but I am not convinced that the authors have as deep an understanding of the phenomena they are writing about as they would like the readers to believe.  The book reads like a narrative, full of assertions that are not backed by rigorous analysis of hard evidence.  The authors do not critically explore causal relationships, nor do they talk about research that has done so.  They present only one particular perspective on the unfolding of events, and they do not defend this perspective against potential criticism.  My experience with economics has always reinforced the idea that causality can be difficult to establish, and can often operate in unexpected ways.  An economist must proceed skeptically, being careful to explore alternative explanations and being prepared to defend assertions with theory and data.  The authors do not seem to share this view, taking instead a more naive approach.  Maybe I was expecting too much; after all this book is meant to be accessible to non-economists.  However, making a book more accessible does not necessitate a lack of rigour or the absence of critical thought; the authors could have removed some of the redundancy in the book (their writing is far from concise!) and replaced it with explorations of alternative perspectives.  The book would be greatly enriched by adding more discussion of research that supports (or opposes) their views 
 How disappointing. I was eager to receive this book and as it only took about 45 minutes to read from front to back, I didn't put it down because I kept thinking that there had to be some redeeming value. Some useful tidbit of information that I as a person who has never catered anything could use. There was not one thing in this book that someone with common sense wouldn't think of themselves. There appears to be only one reason this book was written. The author had enjoyed being a caterer and when she left the field to raise her son, she needed money. I'm only sorry that she didn't put more effort and thought into it 
 how in the World that Dave Chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery?? so now that he choked a 50 Million Dollar pay day away he got smart&knows He doesn't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place. this is a Insult to Wattstaxx. that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess.  the music Acts on here are lame as well. you want the Big Acts  of today not no Milk carton, Has-beens or non-hit having acts.  the only thing funny about this film is that it got made&was released. glad his corny show is no more. good riddence. this movie is equally bad as well. 
 Don't buy this oven. Wait until the next generation comes out. I read the reviews and the guy who said it's of low quality is correct. This should be an under-$100 unit.  It rattles, the temperature is off by at least 50 degrees and  the door gap grows as it heats up. The thermostat is a cheap bimetal, not bulb, type. The temp setting of 300 degrees is actually 400 plus inside. I did not buy this at Amazon and it is going back 
 I had this in my cart and just "Thought" it sounded like a useful tool to protect my investment. I cannot thank ALL of you who were honest and told me what damage this could do. Thank you all again!  mckinle 
 I bouht this book because another reviewer referred to the "chocolae pasta."  There is no such recipe in this book!  This book really doesn't offer much beyond some variations in  spices and flours used to make pasta, most of which any cook willing to experiment a little could come up with on his/her own.  A total waste of money 
 The title of this book would lead you to believe (or at least it led me to believe) that it is a supplement to other books on Windows 2000 and that it would provide guidance on the use of the unique features of the Professional Edition.  On the contrary, it is a plain vanilla manual on the use of the general features of Windows designed apparently for the novice who needs to be told how to open a file.  If this is what you are looking for, fine.  But if you want to learn how to use the real power of Windows 2000 Professional, you need to look further 
 It is not good as  a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant . Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching "I like to play games" , its a much better soft-porn movie.  
 If I could give this book zero stars I would. This book was complete waste of money, the jewelry is uninspiring and the workmanship is so poor that I can't believe the author has actually managed to sell some of her creations. Most of the pages are filled with colorful and pretty pictures of beads but I didn't buy this book to see pictures of beads, I wanted to get ideas to create jewelry. There are thousand times better books out there, don't waste your money or time with this book 
 This movie stunk out loud.  Don't bother seeing it.  Even I think that it's very violent.  Usually my Dad says that.  But I gave it a shot.  There was too much violence.  There are some bad words.  So you have to turn the volume down so you can't hear it.  It is very bad.  It stunk.    I'm six.  
 The encoder system is wrong for our recorder and I do not know what to do. Can you help please 
 There were a few interesting nuggets of information in this book, but there were miles of reading between them.  The first part of the book is an exercize of retelling you how great this book is going to be and how it will change your business life.  The rest of the book is a smattering of pedestrian marketing information repackaged to sound like astonishing breakthroughs in thinking.  Yes, I understand the components of selling three ways.  Yes, I get it.  What a waste of time and money 
 I wonder if the same thing happens to me, but it seems people always get hypnotized into thinking some actually crappy groups is really good.  I think certain types of brains are more susceptible to the powers of the subliminal hypnosis, and others are not.  You see, when we read the reviews on here we don't know who is under the band's magical spell and who isn't, so we end up buying an album based on the rage reviews that some people who normally have great taste in music. We then order the album, listen to it, start wondering, "nah, this must be an acquire album, like espresso or something."   After the 5th listen it just starts pissing you off more, because you've been wasting your time and money searching for something that isn't there.  Finally, you realize that the positive reviewers are not deaf, dumb, or part of the band's extended family, but they are just under the magical hypnosis of some cut rate band.  All joking aside, this album pretty much sucks for reasons I don't even want to get into.  There are moments when you think they may have stumbled on to something, but then it quickly vanishes into some repetitious electronic nonsense.  Some people have it, some don't.  Notwist does not.  The comparisons to Radiohead are offensive and sacrilegious, but you are forgiven because you know not what you write, you poor spellbound listener 
 Luckily you dont have to invest to much time to finish this book. There is really only about 20 pages of actual story the rest are descriptions of visual effects. Its as if Clevenger is pleading with Terry Gilliam to turn this into a movie. This story is in the wrong medium. On the plus side I would love to watch this if it was a movie it would be a trip. 
 I like Atwood, and Oryx and Crake is well-written. That said, this book is nowhere near as good as it should be, and if you read science fiction regularly you'd do well to avoid it.  The problem is that it takes a standard dystopian plot--man plays God, destroys world (intentionally this time)--of the standard genetic-engineering-gone-mad subvariant and stretches it out over 440 pages for no good reason. There's lots of bells and whistles, but there's not much to it: in a post-near-apocalyptic world where massive floods have destroyed all large low-lying cities and meat is a fantastically expensive delicacy, the heavily consumerist population seeks eternal youth and joy through the use of organ farms and designer drugs. At the same time, nutcases keep releasing killer viruses that threaten all of humanity and are kept at bay only through the use of newer and better vaccines and treatments--except the pharmaceutical companies that produce the drugs are also producing the viruses and releasing them so that they can profit from the cures! Oh, no! And, what's more, one rogue scientist has gone that final step and produced a new kind of human, one that suffers none of the moral failings of homo sapiens, as well as the worst plague of all! Then most everyone dies due to that final, terrible plague, leaving the new humans in their anti-Eden. There you go: I just told you the basic plot of this book, 600 books, and about 400,000 high-school science-fiction writers' year-end projects.  The problem is that, while you get the general idea about forty pages in, it takes most all the book to pin down the details. What's the rest? The main character, Snowman, sitting in a tree and ruminating on how miserable the world is and thinking back over his childhood and introducing all the pseudoscientific details--400 pages of pseudoscientific details. The only truly human element, the rogue scientist (Crake's) motivation for destroying humanity and replacing it with his new and improved humans, only becomes clear in the last fifth or so of the book. What is it? Why, by gosh, it's jealousy, an emotion scientifically brilliant but foolish Crake had thought irrational! He's jealous that his lover, Oryx, is having it off with Snowman, you see, and so goes bonkers. No, we've never seen that before, the brilliant scientist who can't handle emotion.  Now, Oryx was introduced early on as a child-porn actress who first stirs then-teenaged Snowman and Crake's moral sense when they watch her "perform" on the Internet, but then she's abandoned for probably 75% of the book, then reappears when Crake digs her up and both he and Snowman immediately fall violently in love with her. Oryx, who claims to love Crake, suddenly and for no reason seduces Snowman, a non-entity if you ever read one, and they have an affair for about 20 or 30 pages before Crake loses his marbles and destroys the world. Yes, you read it right: the event that leads Crake to release his killer plague takes up five or ten percent of the book and isn't particularly well set up. The rest of the book is all pseudo-technical detail illustrating what a soulless, commercial, and ultimately doomed place the future Earth is.  I'm guessing Atwood wrote this for people who don't read science fiction and thus was trying to present these events as someone moderately average would see it. In this she largely succeeds: the book leaves a lingering nasty taste in your mouth. On the other hand, would Mr. Future Joe Average sit in a tree at the end of the world and think for hours and hours about the horrid wonders of artificially grown meat?  As I said, if you read science fiction already, you'll have seen this written a lot more deftly. If you don't, it may serve as a decent introduction to this variety of dystopic novels 
 Packwood attempts to create a magical paradigm using memetics as his field of study but unfortunately he abuses the subject matter.  Attempts to mystify and colour the system are lost in juvenile descriptions such as "Root Social Matrix" which he attempts to pass off as "substantial".  Even more scary are his references to meme-atoms and meme-molecules.  Memetics is a science; Packwood attempts to create a magical model using pseudo-science as his framework. He has possibly done more to damage magic's worth in the world of science than anyone else by writing such a poor book.  Pseudoscientific claptrap made worse by the courier new font in large lettering for kids - except I wouldn't let my children read this rubbish! If you want to get into Magical Memetics, read the literature and make it up as you go along, you can only do better than Packwood 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways.  I liked to idea, but just doesn't work.  This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round.  The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets "stuck" and we have to push it to get "unstuck".  We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store.  (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture. 
 This book was lacking something. There were alot of times in the book where it dragged and I was tempted to put it down. I was simply disappointed with this book. I don't think that E Lynn put enough thought into this one and so far it has been his worse 
 Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world.   As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.    Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.   
 The differences between females and males was truly the best part of the book. After that I had several disappointments. As a single Mother I am looking for suggestions and guidance. This author states that no matter what we do as parents are children's lifestyles and habits are based on how their brains are formed!! How discouraging. There were also other references that go against my own personal and spirtual beliefs. My suggestion to other potential readers is to read this book from a different perspective. Do not read it as a guide as I did. Read it as another viewpoint out there about the incredible world of boys 
 Completly false, and I am delighted to see this slop falling into the garbage pile where it belongs. Robert Slatzer was never married to Marilyn Monroe, in fact he never knew her beyond the fan/star meeting on the Niagra movie set.  Anyone who quotes Robert Slatzer in their bios on Marilyn are only perpetrating the falsehood, and proving they did little primary research.  They paraphrased others without testing the validity of the information. This kind of fake, hack writing is a freak of our times and truly a disaster! 
 I am not alone here when I say that Knit 'n Style is a joke to most knitters. Myself and my knitting friends agree that it's evidence that someone, somewhere, is seriously deluded if they think that these patterns are what the average knitter is yearning to make. I can't help but believe that if you can't get published in a worthwhile knitting magazine then you go to Knit 'n Style. Because, seriously, they'll take anything and try to sell it to poor unsuspecting knitters.   Save yourself the money and flip through this magazine if you see it on the shelf somewhere. You may get lucky and find one pattern that's worth making in a single issue... but then again, you may not. I suggest Interweave Knits, Family Circle Easy Knits, or Vogue Knitting if you want patterns you'll actually want to wear. 
 This is a very difficult text to get through.  Although it brings up a lot of interesting theorems, the language used makes this inaccessible to most readers 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 when i accidentally picked up THE TIN COLLECTORS and found myself unable to put it down, i had high hopes for its follower THE VIKING FUNERAL.  i'm a lover of serial thrillers and was excited to suddenly begin to start a new one.  but my serial stops at Book 2.  THE VIKING FUNERAL is filled with so much of the same ol' threats and "who cares?" betrayal that it reads as if desperate to fill pages.  The beginning and the previous book's excerpt was enough to hold a reader and encourage him to continue, but somewhere on page 200 i threw my hands in the air and tossed the book across the room.  well, not so dramatically speaking but u get the idea.  if u've read TIN COLLECTORS, keep the good impression of the series u have by NOT picking up it's follower.    THE VIKING FUNERAL could be called THE SERIES FUNERAL 
 Supposed to be great. Critics loved it. So original. I thought it was boring and annoying. A collection of short stories about unlikable people, a lot of gibberish that was intentionally unintelligible. Which is fine for a while, but an entire book is too much. I really disliked it. I applaud any attempt to do something completely different, so I give it two stars instead of one, but jabbing knitting needles into my eye sockets would be different too, and I wouldn't like that much either 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book. I don't recommend this book to other 
 I'm sorry to say but I just couldn't get through this book. Read about half of it, but I'm not into long meandering descriptions. If you want a plot that will carry you along, this is not the book 
 This novel is a waste of time.  I expected it to be more character-driven,  with people I could like if there was more substance to them.  I enjoyed  the characters of Stephanie and her daughter from what few  characterizations were given, but I still needed more.  The people in this  book are all ultra-rich which just makes the reader depressed that she/he  isn't rich too.  It seems like all the characters do in this novel is  travel from country to country, which I cannot relate too.  They also don't  seem to change that much by the end of the book.  The plot is boring and  corny, with many other subplots popping up (like one of Stephanie's sons  having an obsessive ex-girlfriend) that never get anywhere.  The author  also made it sound like Stephanie's daughter Chloe's father was going to be  a big suprise in the end.  It wasn't, just another rich guy.  It would have  been great if Bradford had made him someone who was average.  Overall, I  didn't like the book.  It was too sappy and depth-deprived 
 It just didn't do it for me.  Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading.  But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story.  He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.   Good writing?  Yes.  Interesting characters?  Somewhat.  Compelling plot?  No.   Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers.  Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with.  Maybe he just tried too hard. 
 Purported knowledge not IN style anymore by the socalled academic elites.  Evolution, in the boxing ring got a KO by Professional scientists who UNderstand that KO means down.  Who LIVES for evolution other than those who live IN illusion.  Some day there will be enough people on EArTh to expose the lies of this ridiculous theory.  Until Then, Lies they will tell, and Exceptional lies they will be 
 I'll preface this by saying that I'm a university teacher who cares deeply about teaching, which I guess must be why this book was recommended to me in the first place. The early chapters I found simply intolerable, heavily reliant on unexamined truistic claptrap about self-knowledge, the soul, etc, etc. The whole book is overwritten and florid, like the inside of a greetings card. It is hard to be genuinely profound in that sort of prose, and I wished that Parker, who is clearly a wonderful and thoughtful teacher, had had the courage to write in something approximating the language of normal speech.  I said the book gets better as it goes: the chapter on subject-centered learning is absolutely first-rate, if you make it that far 
 Rosemary Wells' book entitled Felix Feels Better is one of our family's new favorites.  I went to the book store seeking out more of her books.  I thumbed through this one and thought it looked really cute so I bought it.  It wasn't until I got home that I read the phrase, "Nora!" said her sister, "Why are you so dumb?" repeated several times in the book.  Name calling of any kind is not practiced in our house and I was disappointed to find this in the book.  This is also not a book that my son's teacher would read in class for the same reason.  I will be returning it to the book store.  Very disappointing 
 Badly organized book.  Repetitive text and graphs.  Stretching theories.  Bad analogies.  Hardly provide any useful framework can be used in real life.  Like the auther is sitting in a small dark room and murmuring to himself 
 Some times it is nice to have a book that points out the obvious. You can be too close to a problem to notice the obvious. Unfortunately this book is too obvious. And it is all fluff with no substance. Wait you say. This is a design book what do you want? Code?  I really wanted design. So where is it? Between the pages that tell how to use exotic tools to do what html can? Or is it between the lines that keep emphasizing speed? Or is it that this is one big advertisement for the contributors? Oh well, it makes you look scholarly to have this book on the Koffee table 
 For some reason, Amazon keeps deleting my review but here it goes again.  I personally found the book interesting when I first read it (particularly the box theory on triggering stock purchases and sales).  However, when I bought a later copy I found a newspaper clipping from December 1964 which stated that the New York Attorney General had sought and received an injunction against Mr. Vargas from promoting his book because the results he cited were not real.    I don't know how the case ended up because there was only the one clipping, but buyers should be forewarned before buying this book 
 Hoffman's recipes sound delicious, but in fact are often flavorless. If you use her recipes, you WILL learn slow cooking tecniques (stacking meat in the pot, thickening sauces, etc). But after 7 years of using this book, my notes on the recipes have a continual refrain: "Needs more pizzaz"; "Add vegetables"; "Flavors need more depth". 
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 It realy is difficult to find words to describe how bad this book is. It starts off with a young lad at University falling for a young girl who is in love with someone else who has gone missing after reading some 'mysterious' book and then the two of them go wandering around Anatolia stealing peoples identites from car wrecks.  Believe me, I havent told you the plot, there isn't one. Orhan Pamuk is one of those unique writers who is blessed with a publisher who promotes his books to the hilt in the West as much as they are in Turkey (they are published in English at the same time they come out in Turkey)that doesn't however mean that they are any good.  Orhan Pamuk has hit upon a winning formular for writing. Write for 2 audiences. One the upper middle class Turk for whom ibn Arabi is an Arab president (sic) and Dante is an Italian footballer (sic) and a Westerner who knows absolutly nothing about Turkey, Islam or the Middle East and why write for these 2 audiences? Because anyone else would see though his books in a minute. His quotes from ibn Arabi and Rumi (which seem to appear in all of his books) are totally out of place, out of context and read like he has just flicked thought a 'dictionary of Middle Eastern Sufis' and found a few quotes. His quotes from Western classics are equally out of place. His plot goes nowhere apart from to boredom and his storyline leaves the reader simply frustrated (as to having wasted so much of his/her time reading such rubbish)  Also notice the fact that 'Milliyet' newspaper appears in all of his books including this one (does he have a contract with this newspaper? 
 I read all the great reviews about this book, but what really made me buy this book is because one reviewer described how he/she trains in martial art for so many years and this book offers effective and deadly self defense moves with no training required. ok, so i bought the book for about $13, when the book arrived I was surprised by how small and thin it was, yeah its only 96 pages, but its half the size of a notepad. Anyhow, its the content that count right? Well, I read through the whole book in less than a hour, the book does help set your mental state and mental awareness, it describes different situation and how criminal now are more violent than ever. It uses the scare tactic to prepare your mind into thinking: "fight to kill, or be killed". Everything is great until I get to the actual 12 technique section...then it starts getting disappointing....its like technique #1: kick, #2, punch, #3 poke eye, #4 punch some more.....you get the picture. Then you get to the pictures section, which pretty much look all the same except in a different scenario. Just click on the available "Search Inside" Amazon images and that's basically it. Pull hair, hit throat, poke eye, kick inside knee...ok, maybe I knew more about self defense than I thought I did, all these techniques are very effective but I consider them as survival instinct and second nature, I was hoping for so much more based on the review. In the book it mentions being approached by multiple aggressor, but no where does it teach or show you how to defend against multiple aggressor.   Anyhow, this book can be recommended for anyone as a starter "mental preparness" book whom has never read an self defense book in their life. But for a good starter self defense book I would recommend Royce Gracie's book instead.   All in all my next self defense book will be a book against guns and knives, cuz now a days no one is going to rob or attack you without a weapon, nor do people fight one on one. 
 Take a look at the cover art: this is a book only for one type of ménage a trois, the one with two women and one man.  While the problems a woman may have with deciding to do this it is just assumed that men are so horny they'll jump at the chance.  This ignores the homophobia in our culture that hits men very hard.  Also Gammon repeats that it is most commonly men who want a threesome yet focuses on what they must convince their primary partner to do in order to get another woman involved. I found many of the statements about men and women both to be sexist, rude, and downright offensive. She mentions many previous studies but other than ancedotes she does not offer documented research of her own.  She claims that this book will lead you step by step through a process to achieve the two women and one man sexual encounter but frankly I was so offended that if I knew someone was using this book or even had it in their library, I'd walk away.  The title needed to be far more honest 
 I only finished this book out of morbid curiosity.  Was this book even edited???    At least one third of this book could have been scrapped on the first skim reading.  The vast majority of the "sim" development and interaction is completely unnecessary to plot mechanics or understanding of the material presented.  Their characters are WAY overdeveloped to the point of distraction.  The material and philosophy he wants to cover requires either A) vast explanation or B) toss the idea out there and let the reader do their own contemplation.  Asimov was a master at the latter.  Beneford tries the former with disastrous results - pages and pages of superfluous, weird visualizations of mathematical concepts.  Asimov hinted at visualizations without losing narrative focus, Beneford inundates and distracts you with them.  Then there's Panucopia.  Ultimately this entire sequence is completely irrelevant, despite his weak effort to tie it in to the underlying concepts.  You can skip this entire section and actually have a more satisfying experience just wondering what the Author refers to when the "Pans" are mentioned "Oh, so he gained some insight into human society when he observed some primates of rudimentary higher intelligence in their natural habitat.  Gotcha!"    As many other reviewers have pointed out, he changes the characters substantially.  Hari seems to be a master politician by the end.  He's also a great orator and not very reluctant as first minister.  Dors and Yugo only share the same names as the Asimov versions.  I don't think he destroyed Olivaw, but the immortal robot was far less enigmatic and mysterious by the end of it.    The conflict with the aliens in the "mesh" who have this simple desire for revenge is completely unsatisfying.  These beings, capable of higher intelligence, having been completely wiped out by robots under the command of Olivaw, have their simple desire for revenge sated by killing a few of his underlings.  And the author clearly wants us to believe that the great intellectual Hari Seldon bought off on their whole story.    Concerning his philosophies - ultimately he doesn't even do the reader the courtesy of concluding the questions he took several hundred pages to ask and seemingly try to answer.  There is no desire to go looking in a sequel either because he just tires you out.  I can respect the author's approach in not trying to imitate Asimov and to make this a Beneford book in the Foundation universe, but I can't respect his result.  
 It is shocking how poorly written and uninformative this book is.  I had purchased it after having seen it advertised in "The Barnes Review", a publication I had previously known to be thoughtful and scholarly.  My opinion has now been altered by this experience.  The writing of this book is so poor that it is difficult to discern in many cases the intent of large portions of the narrative.  It certainly does not represent what I had hoped for, a well researched and thoughtfully presented rendering of medieval European history.  The only thing useful in this book is the standalone chronology, which can be found at the end of the book.  Dates are important in the study of history.  But excellent writing skills are equally important for the communication of the great ideas and movements of history.  And the writing herein is truly terrible.  If you are searching for an excellent book on the topic of medieval Europe, I urge you to look elsewhere.  Knowing what I know now, I would not have wasted hard earned money on this book.  Addendum 07-Apr-05:  For any who are interested in this topic of a generalized history of Western Civilization, I can heartily recommend Hilaire Belloc's "Crisis of Civilization", which is also available from Amazon.  It is beautifully written and truly excellent 
 I'm with many of the other reviewers: stick with the Princeton Review's test prep, and the Norton Anthologies. This book is trash. I'm infuriated that it's considered a valid study guide and continues to be published; whoever edits this should be ashamed. Here's a sample practice test question:  Which three elements best define Post-Modernism?  a) Randomness, excess, discontinuity b) Flashback, fragmentation, humor c) Nature, faith, solidity d) Immorality, sense of loss, meaninglessness e) Montage, metaphor, absurdity  I was longing for an answer choice f) that might read "One adjective from each of the above. A pastiche of the pre-existing choices."  The Research and Education Association lists a) as the correct answer. If you buy this book, you'll be answering questions that would never be asked on the GRE in English Literature, and you'll be scouring the answer choices for the incorrect answer that the slip-shod REA would call correct 
 I wish Mr. Gore had imbibed more of a biblical foundation during his growing up years in the Bible belt.  He uses the thesis, that the only thing which creates familial bonds is luvvvvv, to then say that families come in all shapes and forms....2 daddies, or 2 mommies...ughhhhh!  It is no accident that in the book of Genesis, the creation of the familial bond is linked to the sexual act between a man and a woman. "A man shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh." In the New Testament, Paul interprets this sexually, arguing that for this reason one should not sleep with a prostitute inasmuch as you would be becoming "one flesh" with her.  So, the Gores need to repent, return to the biblical foundation, and realize that luvvvvvvvvv is not the sole nexus where familial bonds are released. It is equally in the coming together sexually of male and female.  But then, if he were to say that, he would make certain "families" feel bad. Then he would lose part of his political support. Then he would be called "bigoted" "racist" "homophobe" and "dumb."  
 Both my daughter and I have found some wild variations in the readout from this scale.  I would not recommend it for accuracy.  
 The author's approach is natural and meditative but lacks a step-by-step strategy.  For those looking for steps to recovery, I suggest reading the book, Alcoholics Anonymous.  This is THE founding text from which all other  12-step recovery programs began.  Believe me, a recovering alcoholic, I  found the SOLUTION in the 12-steps and with other recovering people.  It  saved millions of lives as well as my own 
 I have just put this book down, a little more than halfway through. The only other author I've ever done that for is Robert Ludlum. Like Ludlum, Hamilton has never met a word he didn't like. Every person place or thing has multiple modifiers and the action is explained, rather than allowed to unfold. Add some cliche characters (Dead-head style Techno Billionaire wandering through space, 'Right-Stuff' Space Captain, etc) include way too many side plots and story lines and this wandering, undisciplined tome is just too much work. Are there no editors? No red pencils or pens? If I knew his address I'd send Peter Hamilton a copy of Strunk & White. There are still some great Alien-Culture, Hyperspace-Travel genre sic-fi books out there. This isn't one of them  
 This is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system. There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee. That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces. Unless you're absolutely enthralled with the taste of Flavia coffee (or one of their other beverages) there are better, cheaper, less wasteful alternatives 
 I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone and her walking tapes and have several for variety and love them all.  I recently bought this book based on the reviews of others but found it really was geared to those who are new to walking.  There is one small chapter for advanced walkers but it doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know if you currently do Leslie's tapes.   If you are just starting out walking, you may find this book contains some good information and inspirational stories.  But if you are already a "Walker", your money is better spent on a new Leslie Sansone DVD to make sure you have variety in your workouts and a subscription to Weight Watchers magazine, which will provide you with more insight into healthier eating habits.    I returned my book.  Sorry Leslie 
 Although everyone empathized with June, we couldn't understand her loyalty. We wished she had been as loyal to Aunt Peggy. There were some readers that didn't finish because they felt the story was going nowhwere.  Then you had those that finished only to be relieved that it was over.  We hope that June has sought some type of professional counseling behind this, because this was not something that you just "get over".  Having been rejected by her mother and knowing that it wasn't just her (but her white brother and sister too) should have made the blow a little easier.  It's evident that June placed a barrier around herself to shield her feelings as an adult.  She is a successful lady despite her past and that matters most.  
 I ordered this book because my husband who owns his own remodeling company never gets around to fixing anything in our home (go figure).  I was disapointed because it seems most of this book refers to is for people who have ZERO knowledge.  How to look at a circuit breaker?  Come on if you don't know that then you don't need to attempt any of these things in this book.  It did include some basic wiring which I was glad for.  I would definitely save your money however & find something not so "dummy" oriented if you already know the basics. 
 I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning.  French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying.  Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more. 
 This book (The Return of anti-Semitism) is merely a catalog of the rise in modern anti-Semitism. It ultimately fails deeply and thoroughly by not even attempting to explain the reasons for anti-Semitism or the solutions to anti-Semitism. Indeed, the author even seems quite proud to brag about not knowing the reasons or solutions. It is as if he is so horror struck at the mere thought of anti-Semitism that he feels his only job is to point it out so that the whole world too can be equally horror struck with guilt. Being horror struck, however, is not a sensible or just policy.     It's true that in America we are still horror struck and guilty about anti-Semitism, largely as a result of our particular moral disgust at the German holocaust. Accordingly we always support the Israeli gov't, although nobody really knows where this policy came from or why we pursue it despite the world wide hatred toward us that it has engendered, and the direct connection to 9/11. We don't dare risk sounding anti-Semitic by suggesting  that if we had supported a just peace (internationally built and defended wall at internationally recognized borders) in the Middle East rather than blindly supported the Israeli occupation, 9/11 would probably not have happened. After all, the terrorist are over here because we're over there.       When Likud came to power in Israel they openly swore Israel would no longer be a "dwarf state" and that they were not occupying the West Bank but rather liberating Judea and Sumeria according to Biblical prophesy. Much of Israel does not support this blatantly imperialist, racist policy; yet America does out of a blind dumb fear of being or feeling anti-Semitic. You can admire us a little for being so sweet,  but how practical  is our sweetness and dumbness when directly and indirectly it caused 9/11 and makes us hated by much of the world? As long as we blindly give Israel the weapons to kill Muslims in the West Bank how can we blame Muslims for thinking of us as Western Crusaders or Zionist occupiers, and much of the rest of the world for hating us as Texas sized bullies?     The author completely ignores the core issues causing much of modern anti-Semitism and the possible solutions, because he prefers to manipulatively capitalize on the Holocaust guilt that has served Likud's deadly occupation of the Muslim West Bank so well. We can no longer blindly pretend, as this author does, that modern anti-semitism can exist separately from American's and Israel's 50 year war against the Muslim West Bank 
 This shirt is one of a kind.  It was the only dark navy shirt with a large Chicago Bears logo on it that I could find.  It was a little large for me, but looked great the first time I wore it.  However, after just one wash, some of the logo started peeling off!  I can't imagine what this shirt will look like after next season, probably will just be a navy long sleeve shirt...buy this shirt with caution 
 there's no music, as it were, in what a.s. byatt does:  i have read three of her novels now and i'm, i think, in a pretty good position to judge her stuff as utterly pretentious and banal.  read just one page of hers and compare it to a paragraph (a single sentence?!) of James Joyce.  i am an english prof--hence all the lit allusions in this novel just kinda made me sick.  she drops so many names/quotations you need an imaginary broom to sweep them away.  dreadful dreck.  you need something Englishy to read--investigate William Boyd or Julian Barnes.  byatt is like a parody of good writing.  only salman rushdie's fiction is more onanistic (though his criticism's pretty cool).  byatt is the literary equivalent of Stevie Nicks!  Icky!!! 
 The first disc was defective.  Returned it for replacement. The replacement is very slightly out of sync of video and audio at the end of movie.  Shows poor quality  control.  
 This book moved slowly, and didn't keep me interested very well.  The symbology was not very subtle, the author just laid it out in front of you, not letting you search for it at all.  I thought the second half was better than the first.  
 Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.  I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.  This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.  Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.  The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.  The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.  Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them 
 This book by Ron Rhodes and Marian Bodine is nothing short of a series of straw-man argumentation and non sequiturs, alongside scriptural eisegesis (and I say this as someone qualified in theology). In one of his claims, he asserts that the hill in New York is THE Hill Cumorah of the Book of Mormon. There are a number of things wrong with this. While some have accepted such to be the case, the internal geography of the Book of Mormon refutes such. The Book of Mormon makes clear that the demise of both the Jaredites and the Nephites took place near the narrow neck of land. Yet New York is thousands of miles away from any plausible configuration that could be described as this narrow neck of land. Thus the scripture itself rules out the idea that the Nephites perished near Palmyra, and that the hill in New York was not known as Cumorah until 1835, becoming a namesake. Furthermore, Mormon 6:6 claims that the records Mormon had, except the plates he gave his son, Moroni, which would be the source of the Book of Mormon, were buried in Cumorah, revealing that the final resting place of the Book of Mormon plates is notthe same hill as the Cumorah of the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon's internal geography, material culture, and so forth, gives 15 main characterisitcs of either the Hill Cumorah or the surrounding area:   ï¿½        Cities in the vicinity of the hill ï¿½        Towers or steeped pyramids for religious purposes ï¿½        Efficient agriculture ï¿½        Metallurgy ï¿½        Formal political states ï¿½        Organised religion ï¿½        Idolatry at certain times ï¿½        Craft specilisation ï¿½        Trade ï¿½        Writing ï¿½        Weaponry in the immediate vicinity of the Hill ï¿½        Astonomy ï¿½        Calander ï¿½        Cement ï¿½        Wheels   With the exception of crafts and trade, of which there were but little, the vicinity of Palmyra vicinity does not match up to the criteria above. Indeed, most serious Book of Mormon scholars have shown that all Book of Mormon events fit the milleau of Mesoamerica, namely southern Mexico, Northern Guatamala, and some models, Belize. Contra some popular belief, however, most models have little, if any, overlap with Maya areas. The hill that best matches the Book of Mormon's Hill Cumorah is Cerro Vigia in Southern Mexico, fitting all the criteria above. Indeed, even weaponry has been found around the general vicinity of the hill. Full archaeological digs there still has to be undertaken, and one must keep in mind the difficulties pertinent to archaeological searches in Mesoamerica, and the inherent difficulties attendant to the fact that Mesoamerican cultures built on top of the ruins of conquered nations and destroyed all their records. Notwithstanding, the relationship between the Book of Mormon and Mesoamerica reveals great promise, with patience being the key.  Much more could be said about the misrepresentations to the teachings, scriptue, and beliefs of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. One such claim is that no Book of Mormon sites, independent of the Biblical texts, have been discovered. Again, this is flawed. Nahom and Bountiful (1 Nephi 16:34; 17:5) have been discoverd in the Arabian Peninsula (e.g., see "In the footsteps of Lehi" [Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Books, 1994] by the Astons). Indeed, a review of the book can be found at my Website, and I welcome feedback at irishlds87@yahoo.co 
 I expected this book to be more of a training manual of techniques. Instead, every page is a photo with a VERY brief explanation of how or where it was taken, often without enough detail to recreate the idea. Although the photos are beautiful and Tony Sweet is a great photographer, the book is not at all what I expected. If you're looking for a photo book of his work, it's great, but don't expect to learn much from it 
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 The most painfully slow book I've read in years.  I don't think he made it out of first gear until about 3/4 the way through the book. With difficulty he finally shifted into second gear and by the end of the book was cruising at a not-so-exhilarating 30 miles an hour.  The medical and scientific details are accurate and fairly well-written.  The major subplots are "what's for dinner tonight," and "what will the plumber work on next."  The dialogue is artificial and irritating.  It reminds me of a dialogue from one of my third-grader's stories.  Using words like "modicum" and "greasy spoon" I wonder if Mr. Cook could possibly have been born in the same century as the rest of us.  I want my $7.00 back 
 This battery was no better then the old battery it replaced.  When phone was new, battery life was good. Not sure what is the problem.  Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use. Vendor service was good. Or maybe just a bad battery. 
 This isn't funny. It isn't well directed or scripted. Perhaps it could have been great, if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director, but it didn't, so it turned out mediocre at best. Unfortunately, I believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and I to watch. I told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews I'd read, this was going to be a brilliant, hilarious cult classic. But now that we've watched it, he and I both know better. We know it's dreadful, and I can only imagine all the nice things I'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity. The only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and I got into halfway through the movie about where we'd seen one of the actors in the movie before. I'm pleased to say I won the argument. That was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me.  In my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic' as others so often describe it. I don't know how drunk I'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie, or to find it even a little bit funny, but I suspect I would have to get smashed enough that I'd need a stomach pump afterwards.  If you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic, pick up a copy of Flash Gordon. That has great actors, great sets, wonderfully campy scripts, brilliant humour, and a soundtrack by Queen. Furthermore, it has stood the test of time and is still great today, unlike 'The Ice Pirates', which has dated REALLY badly.   Better yet, get hold of some 'Red Dwarf' dvds...seriously, Red Dwarf is sci fi humour at its BEST! It's so good, it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies

 Despite its' title, this book (wide page margins and large type actually make it a distended pamphlet) is only incidentally about Pope Pius XII.  Its' real purpose is to set Roman Catholics and Muslims at each others throats, and to lead Catholics to support any and all actions taken by the Israeli government against Palestinians living within Israeli-occupied territory.  It tries to accomplish this by tarring all Arabs (and by implication, all Muslims) as subhuman beasts.  Throughout this noisome tract, Arabs--wherever and whenever found--are relentlessly portrayed as the exact equivalent to Nazis and vice-versa.  This technique scarcely differs from that of crude anti-Jewish screeds that go from noting that Karl Marx and the Rosenbergs were Jews, to claiming that Jews and Communists are one and the same.  Pius is used merely as a foil to a contemporary, the notorious Nazi-sympathizer, Haji Amin al-Hussaini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.  Considering what a low basis for comparison this is, one hopes that at least some Catholics will take offense at the Pope being dragged alongside such a grotesque figure.  Not a trace of original research or primary sources besmirch these pristine pages.  Instead, the book deliberately conflates two separate and highly emotive issues which will be untangled here.  1.) Pope Pius XII, the Holocaust, and the Jews:  For whatever it is worth, this reviewer believes Pius was caught in an almost impossible situation.  Not only was there legitimate concern that more forceful denunciations of Nazi genocide might backfire; the Pope himself stood in danger of kidnap, capture or murder.  Hitler certainly would not have had the least compunction about such methods; a head of state such as deposed Austrian Prime Minister Kurt von Schuschnigg was imprisoned in a concentration camp until the end of the war, barely escaping execution at the last.    Questions concerning Pius' precise actions during the war have now been thoroughly muddled and muddied by sloppy research, overstatement, and much venom squirted by both Pius' extreme critics and extreme defenders (this book very definitely included).  A recent scrupulously fair and rigidly factual examination of these matters is "Pius XII and the Holocaust: Understanding the Controversy"  by  historian Jose M. Sanchez (available from Amazon).  Regrettably, it will probably be ignored.  Everyone seems bent on finding another prosecutor's charge sheet or defense attorney's brief to augment their pre-fab opinions.  2.) Israel, the Arab States, and the Palestinians:  By now, the struggle between (and within) these groups has become so poisonous, archangels with Ph.D.'s in International Relations would be hard pressed to come up with a solution to the conflict all sides could accept.  To bitter partisans on either side equipped with guns, bombs, microphones, or pens; no falsehood is too gross, no libel too base, and no tactic too vile.  By contrast, Catholics (as well as Christians generally) have a Just War tradition against which all sides are to be judged.  Hopefully, this ugly attempt to further poison the wells of controversy will be seen for what it is.    Perhaps the author should be congratulated; he has managed to becloud and envenom not just one, but two hotly contested topics in 256 brief pages.  Nazi propagandists called this tactic `zersetzung' (literally: decomposition).  How curious to find a rabbi resorting to it 
 Unless you want your dog to be food possessive/agressive, ill-mannered, and riddled with ANXIETY, this is not a book for you.  Having studied the mind and behavior of our canine companions for 22 years, I find this book to be a VERY POOR CHOICE and (at times) bordering on dangerous 
 Obviously a LOT of people worship this band, possibly everybody in the entire universe except me...I just remember that I had to pretend to like this because my annoying high school girlfriends LOVED it. Secretly, I absolutely HATED this---still do. Kurt Cobain wrote in his suicide note that all he wanted to do was play music with Michael Stipe. Not to be insensitive, but shortly thereafter he shot himself in the head. Draw your own conclusions.. 
 That anyone would mistake Greer's pseudo-philosophical rants for either an intelligent or thorough treatment of the subject is a testament to the pitiable state of Christian scholarship on the supposed "postmodern" turn in modern culture. Greer oversimplifies and misconstrues every complex philosophical term he touches, reading Derrida's "play of the trace" as a synonym for nihilism and spends a chapter "refuting" his views without ever providing evidence of having read (much less understood) him (no citations of Derrida's works are given).  If you are looking for a shallow, irresponsible treatment of the postmodern condition that restates evangelical fundamentalism with big fancy words, Mapping Postmodernism should be right up your alley. Those looking for an intelligent treatment of the subject, however, would be wise to find another map 
 I actually saw the advert for this work on Sean Hannity's home page - "The Turth about Hillary" (sic). The spelling probably tells you all you need to know about Mr H and the book. If you seriously wish to learn about real politics, the issues or US political system, this book will not be of use. If you believe that Elvis is still alive, then it is possible you may think it a worthwhile read.  It does however show the appalling state to which US politics has fallen. Most debate is at playground level and this book shows that in clear detail. Free speech is a privilege, not a right, and I will defend Mr Klein's privilege; but that does not mean that I think he is accurate or that I agree with him. I would ask if he would allow me the same courtesy? He certainly would not allow it of Mrs C 
 This book is very poorly written. There are grammatical errors, lots of repetition, and so much awkward writing that I, my grandfather and my stepfather all had to put it down.   I think the only reason this book gets such good reviews is that it is one of the more easily-accessible books on the subject. As soon as there are more mainstream books on the topic, this one will fall by the wayside 
 I was expecting a lot when I purchased this book.  I have been in the cable installation industry for over 25 years.  I was looking for a book to teach communication cabling installation to new employees and to other individuals thinking of entering the cabling installation industry.  The book has two major problems.  First, the book provides cabling specifications that are based on old TIA cabling standards.  BICSI publishes other manuals that have more up to date information.  Therefore, this book contradicts the latest TIA cabling standards and other information that is used by everyone in the cabling industry. Second, most of the book's content is filled with bulleted points organized into lists.  I assume that these bulleted point must be important but there is virtually no meaningful expanation of what these bulleted points mean and why they are important.  As a result, I read lots of pages but didn't learn any useful information from this book.  If you purchase this book and think you will become a cabling expert, you won't 
 We purchased this for our daughter after she loved the original ballet version so much. I expected the same quality of the original product and was very disappointed. The mat is very cheap and flimsy and my daughter broke the headset trying to get it on her head 
 I LOVE THE STYLE, FABRIC, FIT, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE (BUT IT IS A T-SHIRT) I'M 5'2 AND IT DOESN'T COME PAST MY HIPS 
 For months, my father has been pressuring me to read this book.  So, I finally decided to give it a whirl...  I'm only on page 14, and I must say that this book is the most boring, worst written, biggest waste of my time masquerading as legitimate science, sociology, philosophy, and any number of other respectable disciplines.  It says in the introduction that "instead of conducting laboratory experiments and competing for federal grant dollars, he (Bloom) put his interest in mass behavior to work by playing a key role in the careers of rock stars such as Michael Jackson and John Cougar Mellencamp."  No...he went into the entertainment industry because he obviously couldn't cut it as a legitimate scientist.  So, he resorted instead to the sensationalism, ignorance, misinformation, and general bad writing between the front and back cover of this 334 page grueling read.    I know that I said I have as of yet read only 14 pages, but on only the third page, Bloom makes the false assertion that Saint Paul originated (no pun intended) the doctrine of Original Sin.  It was Saint Augustine!  Those who believe in Original Sin often claim that evidence for it can be found in the writings of Paul, but whether or not the assertion of any such doctrine was actually intended by Paul (or whoever wrote in his name--as writing in the name of a famous person was commonplace in the ancient world, and it is believed by the most reputable theologians that many of the books of the New Testament, including the four currently accepted Gospels, were not actually written by those persons whose names they bear) can be neither proven nor disproven.  And to assert that Paul was indeed the originator of said doctrine is irresponsible if this book is in fact not supposed to be a profession of Bloom's personal religious beliefs.    I suppose I could say the he simply didn't know any better, but he should have known enough to check his facts before bringing his manuscript to publication.  Especially since this is not a first edition! He's had many many chances to edit since initial publication to sweep his errors under the rug and he hasn't!  Anyway, as any good philosopher (which Bloom obiviously fancies himself) would tell you, if a person gets his or her facts wrong once, how do we know whether he or she is not wrong all the time?    I have skimmed through the rest of the book and have found some very unfortunate things in addition to what I have mentioned so far.  The chapter entitled "Women - Not the Peaceful Creatures that You Think" is nothing more than the musings of an antifeminist, antiwoman carmudgeon who obviously has been burned and spurned one too many times.  In fact, he states such nonsense as "Females are as much a part of the apparatus that triggers male violence as the men themselves" and "Women encourage killers.  They do it by falling in love with warriors and heroes.  Men know it and respond with enthusiasm."  The first part could be stretched to justify violence against women (including domestic violence and rape) by saying that regardless of whether or not women consciously "want it", they are somehow genetically programmed to "ask for it" anyway.  The second part--I don't have anything to say about that.  I think the utter stupidity of it says it all.  Don't waste your money on this inflammatory, yet boring as hell, garbage.  Buy an issue of Mad Magazine instead.  It's more informative, more intelligent, and a hell of a lot cheaper.  I can't help but wonder though whether the great misogynists of our time (e.g. radio personality R.L. and constitutional lawyer/bad author A.C.) are fans of this book.. 
 'Howl', like most -- perhaps all -- Beat poetry, has not aged well. It's a lazy, ugly poem which could have been written by any well-read and angry college kid. I have read it many times and see nothing in it of any value other than the historical 
 To quote the book, "Those of our readers who expect to find lists comprising all the various scales of color, giving definite information as to what particular color should be used to harmonize with this or that shade, and telling just what combinations  are allowable, and just what are to be condemned, will, therefore, be disappointed."  This book covers how to prime wood and mix colors (reddish brown color is achieved by mixing Indian red and burnt umber) and does give specific color schemes.  This is a reprint from 1883, and the authors mentioned that the printer could not replicate most of the color schemes they envisioned (maybe I need to get watercolor paint and mix the suggested colors to see what they intended).  We are building a Victorian home, and I was looking for ideas of what worked well in the past, but the rust red, dark mustard yellow, greens and browns they showed did not inspire me as I had hoped.  It does have helpful information about color selection, but it is fairly generic in nature.  Most of the plates are house exteriors, but there are a few interior plates as well. 
 It can indeed be extremely stressful for a Japanese speaking foreigner working at a Japanese company in Japan. I say this from direct personal experience. But my impression is that the author's only skill was the ability to speak Japanese. She had no basic office skills e.g. she was unable to perform simple calculations. And she had neither business training nor business experience. Amelie Nouthomb's degree was in philology not business or economics or finance. This being the case she was unqualified to perform any complex tasks. Little wonder that her brief experience of working in Japan was such a disaster. 
 I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken. The "L" shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem. I will call it a receiver. It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break. Over time the receiver doesn't receive.  I would not recommend this product. It's better to have a straight receiver. 
 A rather boring country album...Don'tCall me Shirley is just a ratherdumb attempt at humor 
 This book is too basic. I bought it because of the good reviews. If you are looking for clear cut instructions and variety of good restorative poses, try Health through Yoga by Mira Metha. For more active sequences, best resources are Light on Yoga ad Yoga - The Iyengar Wa 
 I really had high hopes for this book, but was sadly dissappointed.   All of the instructive photographs are taken from video stills and are very poor quality.  None of the finished pieces are in color.  There is no step-by-step for anything and the directions are vague, at best.  As a printmaking student, I was hoping for a great new book to inspire me with ideas.... instead, I returned it 
 I debated whether or not I should write a review.  After all, I only read the first 70 pages or so, after which I decided to stop slogging through this tedious novel.  However, since I assume most people who would buy and read this book are doing it for their own enjoyment, I felt complelled to chime in, although I'm clearly in the minority.  However, I must add in my defense that this book was initially criticized by his contemporaries as a short story that just kept rambling on with no apparent purpose, a criticism I find valid.  The premise sounds fascinating - the journey of a young seaman who attempts to reconcile his dishonorable past.  It sounded like it would be an interesting tale about the conflict between heroics and harsh reality.  However, in the delivery of the story, I lost all interest shortly.  The main problem I see is in the vivid descriptions and imagery.  This, or course, is usually a good thing.  However, Conrad seems to go into such great description of every little detail that it distracts from the main story.  It seems that Conrad could have been just as effective by using half of the words.  The non-sequitur narrative also makes it a bit more difficult to follow, although I think this could have been effective if the narrative would have been more concise and to the point.  However, rather than merely blasting away at "Lord Jim," I will at least give one alternative - "Heart of Darkness", also by Joseph Conrad.  Read my take of this in my other reviews.  This is a much more interesting and more enjoyable read than "Lord Jim", and about half its length.  Plus, it offers a more poignant picture of Imperialism and its ideals (or lack thereof).  Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, but until then I would recommend you give "Lord Jim" a pass and spend your money and time on another novel, perhaps "Heart of Darkness. 
 I hate to be the only critic, but I feel I must interject here for all the skeptics out there. The reviews for this book must be coming from an extremely specific-and therefore biased beyond belief-group of people. Never fear! I am here to save the day with an (I'm sure) equally biased answer to the opposite side. This book is championed for its elevated action and incredible adventure, but truth be told, I found myself bored throughout the novel, always desiring to skim large portions to get to the "good part" (which never arrived by the way). The novel lacked cohesion and organic unity, and felt disjointed at best. This, however, must be forgiven in a novel of this ilk. After all, we don't expect our fantastic adventure novels to rank among esteemed literature. What can be expected, I think, is a page-turning, voracity-inspiring, un-put-down-able (forgive me for lack of concision but it had to be said) novel and you will not find that here. Perhaps I have high standards, but if the book is poorly written, I at least have the right to demand that it doesn't bore me to a dire degree, right? I believe the main problem is that David Gemmel fails at putting you in touch, emotionally, with the story line and characters. First off, his characterization is non-existent, leaving the characters static and uniform. I get the feeling that he wished to represent characters as human, being neither the extreme of good or evil (an admirable goal), but he failed. Guy Gavriel Kay, for one, champed Gemmel here. In his book, I could not help but be utterly empathetic to both sides of the fight. In Gemmel's novel, I was merely confused by the sudden, and seemingly random, changes in character. If he is attempting to elucidate development, or the double-sided nature of people, he executes it poorly. For example, Kaelin lashes out in the beginning of the novel when a friend dies. Later, however, he is extremely calm in the face of a much closer relative's death. In the mean time, no development, mentally is exclaimed. If he is suddenly wise and accepting of the world, it's deus ex machina style. I truly believe that none of this would be true but for the extreme dearth of characterization. In any case, I felt left out in the metaphorical cold, apathetic to the fate of the characters. My other major complaint is that the way he constructed the plot was bewildering and nonsensical to me. It played out multiple inapropos lines of the story, while leaving the critical prophecy unfulfilled and unexplained. To be fair, this is part of a series I believe, though it is difficult to tell which part as that is not referenced anywhere that I can find. If it is meant to stand alone, it certainly fails. Honestly though, from the most purely analytic point of view possible, the plot was ineptly done and baffling at best. It truly lacked cohesion. This is all not to mention the fact that the dialogue was awkward and the prose mediocre. Succinctly said, I would not recommend reading this book, but don't take my word for it. Many other reviewers seem to praise the concise characterization that I hated

 I was really looking forward to this, I've seen Cheap Trick live, and they really put on a good show. I don't know how some of the other reviewers can give this 5 stars for audio. It is like listening to a concert in an empty warehouse - muffled audio, and underpowered vocals.   I have a 5.1 home system and this is probably the worst sounding concert DVD that I've ever heard. I'm giving it 2 stars because I think it was a good show to see live (if you were there), but the audio quality (or lack of it) ruined it for me 
 Enough, enough, ENOUGH already with the Ray Ray. I'm not really sure why this book exists other than to milk the RR cash cow. Her 30 Minute Meal books are getting repetitive, and this looks like it was dashed off in a couple of weeks.   I feel bad for the businesses where RR says what she ordered was "not her favorite" or something similar. What a snot. I'd be PISSED if I owned the Crack'd Conch. I think she's forgetting how lucky she is to be doing what she's doing.   Bottom line, if you're as agog with RR's cuteness as she is, pick the book up. Lots of pics! 
 I can't find anything good to say about this book. I used to be a huge fan of Block's work but now a lot of it makes me cringe. This is her newest book and I received it as a Christmas gift. The plot sounded good in theory (Greek Myths modernized) but I should have known better. There's barely any book here. It's a very slim 116 pages and it's written in a "poetic" style that means each page of text barely has any text on it. It took me less than an hour to read it and I was confused for a lot of it. Half the time I didn't know which character was telling the story - what little story there was to be told. The little blurb describing the book is almost longer than the book itself. I know that I probably would have loved this back in high school (or at the very least pretended to love it) when I was obsessed with Block's work but now? I can honestly say that I threw it down in disgust when I was finished and wished I could have gotten that hour back. I really don't recommend this book to anyone who isn't a teenage girl obsessed with Block's work. 
 "The number" poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers. A four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom, even if it is a number. Eisenberg's number is the inverse of that draw down, or twenty-five times.... well, there's the rub, twenty-five times what? income? expenses? income less savings? projected discretionary spending? Post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? The proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants, experts, philosophers, and casual acquaintances. Eisenberg, a former Esquire editor and short-timer with Lands End, ruminates about a simple question: How much money do you need to feel secure? The problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. And the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. Constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. Constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible.  Eisenberg doesn't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses. Doctors, divorcees, `downshifters', and very little real data shed little light on the real issues. Maybe I knew too much going in. Maybe I expected too much from a few positive references from other sources. In the middle I was confused. By the end I was simply disappointed. And I have my own number, and it changes every day 
 Iam a big fan of lindsey's work in Fleetwood Mac but this was terrable!!! It just goes to show he is nothing with out Stevie Nicks. I was a fool in buying something i never hered about before. I should have listen to my mum and got Sevie's new album, "Trouble in Shangri-La" which is doing exelent on the radio and charts. The only reason i gave it a 2 star is because i feel sorry for him! 
 Although this book is a detailed, if overintellectualised, account of the Sex Pistols' short career and the ludicrous media games of Malcolm McLaren and Glitterbest, It is not by any stretch of the imagination, a book on U.K. Punk. It completely bypasses England's second generation of Punk (1981-1983)out of which sprang many of the Greatest Punk Bands Of All, such as The Exploited, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chaotic Dischord ,Disorder, The Anti-Nowhere League, Chaos U.K., G.B.H., and The Insane! None of these bands are even briefly mentioned in this book! It's As If Jon Savage,poncey journalist that he is, is afraid to acknowledge their existence! Instead he wastes page after agonizing page reading overblown hippie-like ideas into the useless New Wave bands he erroneously believes to be punk! The one or two lines about Crass don't even begin to make up for this pompous smokescreen. Worthless, Stalinist tripe!!!! Save your money and save yourself a headache! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! 
 Edward Hirsch has written a meticulous analysis of the art of poetry, imbued with an authentic love of the form. From page to page he dissects and interprets; his enthusiasm remains high throughout. Not just the poetry, but also the poets themselves are lavished with heroic praise, their craft transcending the mortal. Their words are golden strands of virtue more appropriately whispered into the ears of gods.  But, but...  For those of us uneducated in the art of poetry there is a much more basic level of understanding that has to be achieved first: Why no punctuation? Why do sentences break in mid-breath? How does one find the meter in a poem? How does one read poetry without the stops and starts from line to line? Perhaps we should have learned this in school, but we didn't, so we bought this book.  This is a good book, really, but it is not what its title suggests. It should rather be entitled "The Love of Poetry", or "Falling in Love With Poetry", or "Furthering Your Love of Poetry", or something else emotive. "How to Read a Poem" sounds mechanical, the basics, just what those uneducated among us get when we do a keyword search on how to read a poem.  Select another book in order to learn how to read a poem, then graduate to this one once you comprehend the basics. 
 Never received product. Ordered 6 of the flashlights on Dec. 3 for Christmas presents. E-mailed seller several times to find out where order was, they never answered my e-mails. Good way to do business! 
 Is the United States a Christian country?  Well, not if you believe our Founding Fathers, including George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and Benjamin Franklin.  They argued for complete separation of church and state.   And Wills is actually quite good at telling us what Madison, the most important of them in this regard, said.    But America does have plenty of Christians.  And Wills claims (in 1990) that polls show nine out of ten Americans believe in god.  As a Polytheist who regards such a belief atheistic, I find that a discouraging statistic, but that does not mean it is untrue.  Wills also argues that an atheist (who does not believe in any Goddesses or Gods, not even the monotheist one) would have no chance of being elected President (presumably being a candidate without a prayer).  Given what Adams and Jefferson said about Christianity in their letters to each other, I doubt that either of their positions would get them elected today.  Wills discusses the issue of the words in our Pledge of Allegiance, including the reference to the monotheist god.  I do think symbols are important.  Our flag does not have a Christian Cross on it, and that's intentional.  And I do not understand either side in this dispute.  Do the Christians really want to be on the wrong side of Madison's arguments and demand that Polytheists refer to the monotheist god?  Do non-monotheists really want to appear unpatriotic by refusing to salute their own flag because of these words?  The author then moves into the debate over Darwinian evolution.  And he contrasts William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes trial not so much with Clarence Darrow as with H. L. Mencken.  Willis is quick to criticize Mencken's completely politically incorrect attacks on Women, Jews, and Blacks.  Well, maybe I am just too tolerant.  I agree that Mencken's style was like Nietzsche's.  But I find their works thought-provoking rather than parts of a demonic theology!    Wills then claims that the real winners of the Scopes trial were not the Darwinians.  He is right about that.  After the trial, the quality of American biology textbooks went way down.  Wills says "it was not Scopes that put evolution in the schools, but Sputnik."  That is true.  The author then argues in favor of putting creationism into the science classroom.  I am disappointed with Wills for wanting to do this.  We're not talking about a ritual Pledge to our Flag here.  We're talking about teaching falsehoods in science classes.  Shame on him!    There is also a discussion of Jesus, including the virgin birth, miracles, and resurrection.  By the way, I have always thought these made Jesus less heroic and more attackable.  After all, without any of this, who would dream of comparing Jesus with powerful people such as Stalin or Mohammed or Julius Caesar?  Jesus would be a simple hero and no one would find cause to demonize him.    Wills is not afraid to talk about abortions and a Woman's Right to Choose.  My only comment on this is to say that I can't see an argument for an embryo being sacred in the first few hours after fertilization, before we even know if it will be twins or not.  It is an interesting book, but the comments about creationist arguments are simply wrong.  Even if Wills is being sincere and merely in error here (rather than being reckless or dishonest), I can't give him more than one star for this book after that 
 This stuff tastes great but after doing some research, it's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy.  The first item on the list (which means that it is the highest mass ingredient) is partially hydrogenated oils.  If you have any problems with cholesterol, I suggest talking to your doctor.....  Or maybe you might want to be like many Americans and just increase your Lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers.  Godspeed 
 While the writing was acceptable, I felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced.  The differnce between the classes is too obvious.  The contrast between the rich world (the students in the Wilcox school and the Cornhills) and the streets of London (and Isa's forced marriage to the grocer, and Mrs. Cornhill's predictable and obvious snobbery) was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice.  I was left cold by the overall plot.  One thing that truly bothered me was the fate of Mr. Cornhill and Isa.  I felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired, and was not in true Bronte style.  The characters and their development also left something to be desired.  They were too predictable at times, and Mr. Ellin was just annoying.  There were few occasions when I sympathized with any character, other than Isa (and only at certain points in the plot). There was nothing spectacular about this novel, though I won't discourage anyone from reading it.  It was fast paced and it did hold my interest.  
 More and more, all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like, and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure, and if you indulge in such a thing, you are 'shallow'.   Music has evolved past this attitude, and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore. And oh yeah, their politics is so mixed up, they don't even know what they believe anymore. I was a subscriber for eleven years, my renewal notice came, and I couldn't come up with one good reason to send it in 
 This book was an incredible waste of time. I felt that the essays were a) far too dated (a rambling discourse on the dangers of cookies) or b) too out of touch (Rape in cyberspace was NOT a real rape in cyberspace, folks) The authors seem to be mainly scholars without a tech background than technical folks and I have to agree that the thesaurus was in heavy use during the writing of most of the these essays. Finally the book contains very little practical information on cyberethics. Not even a single case study 
 There is not enough teaching on Hell.  How can you talk about knowing God with out full-blown explanation on the nature of eternal damnation and hell.  It's impossible.  J. I. Packer fails in a great way 
 After watching the 1 Ultimate Avengers I was expecting a another action packed romp through the park, but I realized this was truly anti-climatic. The HULK make the 1st movie extremely appealing with his rip-roaring rampage while decimating everything. I expected to see even more of the HULK this time and pretty much got nothing. Yuk for the sidekicks (No offense all the other hero's are just sidekicks to the HULK) blah, blah. While the Black Panther was cooler than I thought he would be, This was boring. WHERE WAS THE HULK???? Marvel, can you please do an American Icon like the HULK some love and give him some air time? HULK MUST SMASH and I cheered when he did (finally) show up but sorry this movie was mostly lame. Well, I bought it and I am stuck with it. I am feinding for the HULK to take it somebody (Villan or Hero) and open up a can o whup- @zzz. Please Marvel enough with the Aliens, there are some really cook villians in the Marvel Universe (Really Cool) and I have been a fan of the Avengers for decades but as much as I like Indepence Day The Movie, this Avengers seemed more like a knock off. Do yourself a favor wait until it comes on Cartoon Network or something, this was truly mediocre. HULK SMASH!!!! 
 After reading five of her novels, I have become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I will admit (and this probably proves that I am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself) that I've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that didn't make it on the list.   Initially I liked the book and it kept me reading, though maybe just out of habit. I enjoyed reading about the Amish way of life and the Amish traditions - though it did make me think of that Harrison Ford movie, Witness (circa 1989 or something). I like that she used one first person voice as well as the third person narrative in a well crafted and varied way.  I like that her main character has a powerful job that challenges gender stereotypes by being the morally questionable lawyer. That being said, she doesn't explore this as well as she could. We sort of forget that Ellie has blatantly suppressed evidence and watched as little girls saw their rapist acquitted. Rape, she can defend, but infanticide creates some problems for the notorious defense attorney.   Something about the book bothered me. Maybe I am reading too many of her books too fast but I am seeing a formula here.  - Many of her plots include a court room drama.  - All of her plots feature romance or end with the obvious potential for one.  - Mothers and their powerful (all encompassing, self-sacrificing) love for their children are a theme in all of her books I've read.  - There is usually a "twist" at the end. She's becoming Koontz like in her formulaic predictability and I stopped reading his novels as a teenager.  Most of her books left me content, like I'd eaten a good, hearty meal. However, this book left me hungry and searching for critical reviews to see if others shared my dissatisfaction.   So: - I was unimpressed with the "twist" at the end of this one - I knew "whodunit" about 1/2 of the way through. I was getting bored with that part of the story. The red herrings are too obvious and her suggestions that Katie didn't do it were there from the beginning. She should've stopped the heavy handed attempt to make us question that and just made it known through the 3 person narrative exactly who did the killing or hiding. Then she could have explored that character in depth instead of hiding her and others she wanted you to be suspicious about. Just because we, the readers knew, didn't mean that Ellie had to know - or anyone else for that matter.   - The characters in this novel were a tad generic. I am sorry, I like her, but they were boring.   For instance, I was bored with Ellie's dilemma over Coop - to the point where I often skipped the interaction they had when they discussed their potential future together. Duh, I knew they were going to get together after a little drama from Ellie through which Coop - being the quintessential "sensitive ponytail guy" - would wait, albeit in pain. It was just too predictable.  Hannah's ghost; she has a ghost hunter in a later novel and I was a disappointed to see another one. But other than that, Hannah's ghost seems a bizarre and meaningless addition. Is it to suggest that she, Katie, might be crazy and a murderer? Is it to explain why she was so drawn to Adam? Katie being the good Amish girl could only fall for someone who could share her secret ability to see her sister... In a book that is so Amishly pragmatic and logical in every other way makes it so the supernatural element clashes with the rest of the novel. Maybe Hannah's ghost killed Katie's baby or hid it.  I liked the details. The Amish and their daily lives, those who assimilate and those who don't, and how the religion and way of life affect one's thinking offers a neat, un-scholarly insight into a different culture. I liked the culture clashes and I wondered how they would be resolved. But what I did like, doesn't measure against my dissatisfaction.  My most recent book purchase included three works of fiction; two by Picoult and one by Atwood. I think I'll shelve the unread Picoult for a while. I'll have some time to forget her modus operandi. I'll read the Atwood and then I'll buy a book by a different author 
 1. When I open the box. Found there is a loose screw in the heater. Meaning the product quality control has problem. 2. There is no handle to hold the heater. 3. There is no second heat temperature selection 
 Was very disappointed to realize that on my Tivo (series 3, but I don't think it matters) I got the 4:3 version.  NOT the widescreen version.    So of course it displays "windowboxed" instead of full screen.  Yeah, i can ZOOM the tv display but this degrades even further the image quality.  Not very pretty in the end.  Is this going to be the case for all Tivo downloads?  
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you

 I didn't think this book was helpful at all.  It was too general.  I also read Golden Retrievers for Dummies, and there were many similarities.  I wanted a book specific to Dachshunds.  Questions were posed by the writer, but never fully answered.  I don't feel I know any more about Dachshunds now than before I read the book 
 If you've never heard of Mark Halperin I'm not surprised.  None of us had until 2004 when a certain internal ABC News memo came to light during the Presidential campaign.  Oh yeah.  He's now known to people who were paying attention; he even coined a term:  "Halperinization" which along with "Ratherization" because hallmarks of Liberal bias posing as journalism in the 2004 campaign.  Here's the memo, Dated Friday October 8, 2004  "It goes without saying that the stakes are getting very high for the country and the campaigns - and our responsibilities become quite grave  I do not want to set off (sp?) and endless colloquy that none of us have time for today - nor do I want to stifle one. Please respond if you feel you can advance the discussion.  The New York Times (Nagourney/Stevenson) and Howard Fineman on the web both make the same point today: the current Bush attacks on Kerry involve distortions and taking things out of context in a way that goes beyond what Kerry has done.  Kerry distorts, takes out of context, and mistakes all the time, but these are not central to his efforts to win.  We have a responsibility to hold both sides accountable to the public interest, but that doesn't mean we reflexively and artificially hold both sides "equally" accountable when the facts don't warrant that.  I'm sure many of you have this week felt the stepped up Bush efforts to complain about our coverage. This is all part of their efforts to get away with as much as possible with the stepped up, renewed efforts to win the election by destroying Senator Kerry at least partly through distortions.  It's up to Kerry to defend himself, of course. But as one of the few news organizations with the skill and strength to help voters evaluate what the candidates are saying to serve the public interest. Now is the time for all of us to step up and do that right. "  Now, isn't this cute?   Doesn't it explain much about how ABC presents the "news."   It is almost surreal, and he still maintains that he's unbiased.   It's like a visit to Alice's wonderland to hear this man defend this memo; but it explains much about how ABC presents the news.  They are hopeless.  Yes.  He actually thinks and talks this way.    And OF COURSE he hates the news media; it's the new media which has exposed him.  They did in 2004; and with Hugh Hewitt's help this week he's being exposed to more people.    Don't bother with the book.  It's a suck-in for Liberal propaganda. THIS MAN SPECIALIZES IN DOUBLE-SPEAK.  ABC News is losing viewers and losing money; and they deserve it. 
 First of all there is no such word in Websters and I do agree with some of the other reviewers.  I did read Blindsighted and found much repeated word for word from that.  The people in charge of solving this do indeed have too too many personal problems and not enough swapping of information.  When the doc hears something, she doesn't know what they are talking about as no information was given her by the detectives.   After all she was at the scene of most the crimes and should have been given a better handle on it.    Then I hate the way the perps get away with stuff right under the noses of the surveilance.  This author sure leaves you dangling.   
 This book was a reading for my 3rd grade daughter.  I have no idea how or why this book EVER won an award, unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written.  And the illustrations were just as sad 
 Unlike the Chicken Soup authors, Dan feels it's neccessary to add his opinion at the end of each story which leaves the impression he's telling the reader how to feel or react to the story.  These heartwarming, tender stories speak for themselves. It's a very diappointing purchase 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 This book is full of just plain incorrect information, none of which has been corrected from the first edition. The section on the binary language of MIDI is particularly full of errors; not just typos, but errors of fact.  Let the buyer beware 
 The style has totally changed from there last few ep,s. There older stuff is the true definition of post hardcore and i could listen to it all day long. If your into rock that is a little calmer and maybe easier to listen to then it is a good album. The music is not that bad its just the style has totally changed and it doesnt even sound like yesterdays rising. I think it would have gotten better reviews with a different band name. This new album sounds like emery, kinda mellow with very little screaming and mellow vocals. The only reason i give it two stars is because its just not yesterdays rising 
 I was expecting much more from Martha!! I wonder if she evens knows what this planner has (or actually, doesnt have) in it! I would not recommend purchasing this. Definitely go to a book store and preview the planner before purchasing. The only things I like about it are that its full sized with a lot of places to store misc. papers and the advice that comes with it. But, I subsrube to MS weddings, put the advice in there. I like the Simple Stunning wedding planner much better. I felt the MS Planner was a whole lot of nothing. 
 Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. Bought Gourmet cook book instead 
 Note Type M and H xd cards are incompatible with some card readers!  I have a Fuji camera and bought an xd card type M. But it turns out that type M and type H cards are not compatible with all card readers (even ones that work with regular xd cards) so I have to use my cable and camera batteries to upload photos from my new card, or purchase a new card reader. Ugh!  Buyer beware! 
 "Religion" is man's rational means of reaching God.  Catholicism, Muslim, Hindu, Buddha, are  all  systems of 'works' that are intended to please God.  As  opposed to Christianity, which is God's word on how He reaches to man, by grace.  Thus, all the false religions are "science".  Man's invention or rationalization.  So does science crusade against science?  In some cases it does.  Also, Christianity (not religion) has been largely misunderstood because of postmodern thought  which alleges that ultimate truth cannot be known.  For some up to date thinking on the subject read  John Koessler's "True Discipleship: The Art of Following Jesus";  and David Wells,"Above All Worldly Power- Christ In A Postmodern World. 
 this is not a book on *SYSTEMS* architecture.  Like that book on Enterprise (SIC) architecture that was all about LANs and not the entire enterprise ,  this book has too narrow a viewpoint.    The title should be changed so it is not misleading. The author's perspective may be *his* system but to most of us this stuff is at best a  subsystem, or merely a component, or otehr lower level item.  if you want to know about SYSTEMS architecture the key book is rechtin and maier.  there may be a recent handbook of SA that covers a number of topics but eb and mark have the only real systems architecture book that I have verified.   this book is not the book the title claims.  
 If you have read ANYTHING about shamanism or animal totems before this, this book won't add anything. If you have read NOTHING about shamanism or animal totems before this, this book will give you very little, except an oversimplified, surface, meandering view of a very deep and powerful process.  Steiger bounces around on the surface of a lot of things, including numerology, chinese zodiac, and animal collections, but never goes into depth with anything. The idea of animal totems is a loosely held theme holding the book together, but isn't looked at with any depth. It is a typical American beginner's book (a la any subject). Cheerleading - you can do it!! Making it sound easy and trivial. At one point Steiger iterates that finding your animal totems and learning to work with them might even takes weeks or months, pandering to the current tendency toward quick and easy. This type of activity is a lifelong process with serious consequences, not a parlor game to be indulged in lightly.  Steiger's book encourages people to dabble irresponsibly and expect quick results, which usually leads to inconclusive or unsatisfactory results, and often even interferes with a person's later pursuing a subject with sincerity by giving them a false sense of having gained knowledge about the subject. He also makes it easy for anyone to instantly claim any animal as her or his totem without any real inner work and connection to the process, which trivializes a deep spiritual practice.  If you are serious about pursuing working with animal totems, don't bother with this book.  If you only want a watered-down, simplistic explanation of animal totems, then maybe this is the book for you. However, it was a total waste of my money and my time 
 The five-star non-review immediately below is written by an employee (Jeffrey Tucker) of the publisher.  His non-review may be helpful to prospective buyers but the five-star rating obviously is biased.  Since "Economics for Real People" is really a three-star book, I'm providing a one-star non-review just to keep everything in balance.     
 I've just started reading Suzanne Brockmann's SEAL books & am jumping around (rather than reading them in order). I really enjoyed her most recent releases but found this novel annoying in its unlikely character interactions, less than sympathetic treatment by the main characters of Mary Lou, & unrealistic racist reversal of said Mary Lou.   You'd think someone in their little tight-knit world of heroes would admire such a YOUNG person who has stayed sober for 18 months, taken on the significant responsibility of child-rearing & trying so hard to fit in. That some sense of compassion would compel the wives & girlfriends (not to mention the husband) to do something other than sneer, etc.   With that said, I found it politically correct but highly unlikely for such a young, screwed-up-life-character like Mary Lou to magically see the light & have mushy feelings for a non-white man - regardless of how nice he was compared to her hero husband, that jerk Sam.  I read the book primarily to move onto the next one & hoped like crazy Mary Lou wasn't going to be killed off. I was definitely not rooting for that loser Sam and his perpetually angry un-girlfriend to connect.   As for Joan & Mike - the potential was there for some interesting stuff but too much energy was expended elsewhere

 This book is one of Dean Koontz's worst.  Not as bad as THE TAKING, but right in there.  OK, here is the plot ... really, really bad guy kills girl and parents.  A girlfriend witnesses and escapes only to find herself in the hunt for really, really bad guy.  Girlfriend chases really, really bad guy and craters the guy, but that's not all.  During this (yawn!) high drama, the heroine finds a little girl that really, really bad guy has (yawwwwwn!!) captured.  After knocking off the really, really (yawwwwnnnnnn!!!) bad guy, heroine rescues little girl and adopts her. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! Oops, sorry, I nodded off.  Please Dean, can you recall this book?  I mean we aren't asking for an apology here -- just take this piece of junk off the market.  I did see where "new and used" has it for as little as 1 cent.  Uhhhhhh!  DON'T SPEND IT !!! It is not worth it !!!!  And Dean, when you are going to give your email address out to the fans?  Most authors do this.....but, you seem to be reluctant.  Could it be literary cowardice?  Inquiring minds want to know.    Much of Dean's work is excellent ..... this book isn't.  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 I'm not a fan of psychologists as protagonists in mysteries and I'm even less interested when they deal with children. Children in peril is not entertaining. That said, however, I picked up "Rage" at the airport. And thus, my first Jonathan Kellerman novel.  This was a dumb story and far from believable. I could not suspend disbelief. If you read mysteries, the bad guy screams "IT'S ME! IT'S ME!" in the first 30 pages. I was hoping I was wrong, but unfortunately, that was not the case. So, I tagged along and watched Alex and Milo chase obvious red herrings, useless leads, eat some donuts, theorize and solve the mystery!  I cannot mention how bad I thought the story was without giving away the plot, but let's just say that the antagonists and their behavior is just not believeable over the course of so many years.   I'll try an earlier J. Kellerman book. Maybe it will be better 
 Overall, an 'OK' read, but teaches human sexuality as though his audience was a grade-six sex education class as rather than mature-minded adults.  This book is extremely simplistic and vague, and tends to lean towards a more dellusional depiction of human sexuality, often confining it to the contexts of outmodded biblical principles and male-dominated patriarchy.  Lacking modern approach and intimate sensuality, I would sincerely hope that this book is not a reflection of poor Tim's seemingly mechanical sex life!!  I would not recommend this book unless you are totally ignorant and clueless about what sex is all about.  I would suggest looking elsewhere for a more relevant guide to sexual intimacy 
 What company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it won't work. Incredible. My experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written. It just shouldn't be this way.  When I finally did get it working, after tweaking some settings, and spending all freaking day on the Linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house.  I do have to say the their forum is top rate. The people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you don't want to go through scripted support suppliers.  Product wise a very disappointing experience. People wise very good but long gone are the days that you put up with an inferior product because the people are so good 
 Painfully slow movie. The countess drinks blood, but didn't see much of vampirism. The background music is mesmerizing. Good direction.  Sensual nudism. Full marks for lovely Andrea Rau, companion of the Countess. She is a beauty.  On the whole the move is a hype. Leaves lots to imagination 
 I have heard this young man sing on several occasions.  Frankly, short of catching a scathing case of the shingles there is nothing I would rather do than curl up with my favorite Buble' recording and weep openly for the state of music to come.  This young man is a weak comparison to Paul Anka much less Sinatra.  His cardboard arrangements,nescient lyrics, and those special nasal utterings, appealing only to beagles and Otolaryngologists are at the very least, annoying.  People, are we this desperate for another Johnny Ray? Suffice it to say Johnny Ray might be the only person truly suited for a Michael Buble' recording.  Move past this pretentious flash in the pan and search for muscial talent elsewhere. Nothing to hear here 
 I really enjoyed this book - until page 109.  For 169 more pages I read in confusion. I just didn't get it.  Things switched, they didn't flow, a whole "chapter" about a family that is never referred to before or again.  I had to log on to see what others said about this book.  How did I miss that it was a collection of short stories?  For 109 pages things seemed great - I liked the characters, the wit and the writing.  But then things changed and I felt blindsided, cheated and utterly disappointed 
 Wasted my money for this SLOW hub... Be aware that if you want to connect your printer, scanner, ipod etc. to this device, think again 
 A useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between countries.  However, it is not worth the price.  It is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students.  It is more suitable for general second year accounting students.  Plus, as I am working with a multinational European bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date.  There is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries 
 Can't take credit for the title of this review, it's the NY TIMES TV listings capsule summary for the flick, but sidesplittingly true.  This film's from Lana's mid-period; our girl's cast adrift from the haven of MGM, but still not sunk to the depths of THE BIG CUBE.  She's carefully lacquered here, and has the opposite of chemistry with leading man Sean Connery, vital and attractive in an early film role.  Their Forbidden Love Is Not To Be, as he has the good sense to die early on, leaving Lana to seek out his widow, Glynis Johns, so that she can -- oh, why bother?  If you've seen more than three movies in your life, you're miles ahead of every plot turn.  Fun for those of us who like our popcorn sprinkled with a healthy dose of suds 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 I've read several popular physics books, and I think this one was the worst.  I hoped the followup "Supersymmetry" would be better.  I think I made it through the first chapter before putting it down for good.  Try Elegant Universe or one of Stephen Hawking's books instead 
 This book is NOT helpful.  It is poorly organized, full of typos, and not useful.  I am returning it. It's basically just a list of public campgrounds, with no information about location or real reviews, just a list of the amenities or facilities nearby. Stick to the interne 
 I am NOT a fan of this book and I'll tell you why. I have SEVEN children. Yes, you read that right.  We have triplets, followed by twins and another set of twins ALL under the age of 3. God must think we are special, though we know we are blessed. But, obviously we run a tight budget on kids things. Living in NYC in an apartment does not help things. Honestly, I  thought this was a book on bargains and it not. It's a review book to take shopping. So much of this information is based on nothing really.  I highly doubt readers are getting any kind of credible information. These authors have HORRIBLE reviews. Have you read them? Take a peek at the 1 star ratings... wow! Glad, truth be told!  My kids Ellen, Elizabeth, Emma, Valerie, Veronica, Edward and John all are spoiled rotten with hand me downs and the occasion new cool gadget for kids in the house but the boys (just 4 months) really needed new things after all the girls and I am so disappointed this book has little to offer. And--they offer nothing about potty training products which I realy could use advice on for the triplets... just 2. Moms like me need a better source than this book. I'm searching the internet instead 
 This episode is the darkest and possibly the weakest of the three. If this movie is being shown to children, parents should preview it first and fast forward through some of the parts. 
 If you are new with cisco router's security I could suggest this book. However if you are advanced user, it would be wasted  money.Overall I did not like the book... 
 This is one of the worst books that I was required to read for my MBA program. I didnt benefit anything from reading the book. The authors of this book should not be considered "authors", and people should be paid to read such a book!!  When you read the book, you will understand what I say (if you have to read it). The Authors think that readers are coming from the moon or maybe Mars, and that they don't know the clear obvious in their life 
 This book is very much oriented around following a certain structure. Syd focuses on describing the three act structure and how to build your screenplay in this structure. While structure definitely is a valuable element, I would not recommend anybody concentrating on it too much, cause the right structure will come in the right way for your script. Much more important elements like how to create rich characters and to enhance your story are not dealt with very much. If creative advice is given it comes across in a quite rigid way, and is lacking foundation. You really feel that Syd didn't gain his knowledge by working as a professional screenwriter, but just by analyzing them. I am missing that kind of sensitivity, creativity and flexibility in his messages to writers that would come from persons who have really written screenplays themselves. To sum it up: The book was not valuable for me, in fact it left me disappointed and a bit frustrated. Other screenwriting books on the contrary have been a very inspiring and motivating source 
 The cover blurbs mentioned "plot twists", "mystery", and "suspense".  In fact, it's very linear and (spoiler alert?) everything happens EXACTLY as you think it will.  I kept waiting for the twists but they never came.  I like books about athletes, athletic team dynamics, and youth sports issues, so this looked appealing.  Not a bad read, but pretty ho-hum. 
 As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point.   I like to think that there's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super-detailed realism. Generally, a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game, because they're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic, lifelike location. Cartoons, on the other hand, generally don't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time. How much fun would the Wile E. Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate, it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics? Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that's overly detail-centric in an environment that's right out of a kid's show. The result is a tale that comes off as way, WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract. It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way.  Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world, how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear, the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic. There's a princess, evil pigs have kidnapped her, and it's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world. That's it, no side-stories, no reasoning, no subplots - just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B. And here I thought the phrase "save the princess" was universally recognized as an ages-old cliche.  Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm railing on this game just because it's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor. It's also completely lacking in character development, general storytelling and ongoing inspiration. None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals, including the lead character himself. You don't hate the pig on the spaceship because he's trying to destroy the world, you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money. I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three, because she's never mentioned between the game's start and its finish. I mean, the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight.   I don't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging. The first level and a half are set up in the standard "get to know you" format, with the simplest of enemies, the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools. Shortly thereafter, you're thrown to the wolves. For the most part, the level designs are very short, with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge. I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts, whether it's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk (har har) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point. You'll almost always know what needs to be done, but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick. I just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is. If there's a bottomless pit nearby, (and chances are very good that there is) Blinx will find a way to force himself into it, regardless of what you're hitting on the control pad. If there's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button, he'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room, rather than the imminent threat.   That's not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit, because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table, but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings. The ability to control time, for instance, was at the time a really fresh, interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today, despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged. You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge, pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time, knock the level into slow motion, etc. All the while, Blinx is moving around in real time. It's a great idea, but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized. Why can't I use two controls at the same time? Why don't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers? Why doesn't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause, speed up or rewind when I use my time powers? Why is their duration so brief, and why can't I hold more than a dozen uses at a time? I mean, this could've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer.  The controls, too, are an undeveloped, undertested nightmare. Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond, especially when implementing his time controls. He has difficulty making a precise turn, whether on midair or on solid ground. He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item, which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks. He routinely moves in the direction of certain death, as though pulled by a magnetic field, whether you've instructed him to do so or not. He'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump, particularly when attempting a difficult, precise leap across a gaping chasm.   I think it's these controls that most make Blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating. At a glance, you'd imagine they'd be fairly difficult to screw up. You've got a jump button, a suction / fire button, a time control button and an analog stick to control movement. Plus, there had already been a long, established line of three-dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title's release, paving the way to an ideal control experience. Super Mario 64 had its issues, sure, but nothing like this, and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre's jump to the world of 3D. It's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway.  I can't even say I'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper, either. With the exception of the lead character himsef, these are some incredibly cheesy, preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished and hurried, less purposeful than you'd imagine (especially in contrast with Blinx himself). Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels, trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury. Here's a finely detailed main character, with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again, and he's pitted against a set of monsters that could've sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four-year-old's sketchbook.   Despite featuring a spoken dialog track, there's no English voice acting. I couldn't pinpoint the language, but my wife seems to think it's either French or some close variation of it. It certainly didn't sound Japanese. While this does add a touch of personality to the title, and it's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love, it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television. Everyone's vocal personalities are so black-and-white, too, that I feel like a great chance to establish some much-needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here. The bad guys all have the same deep, gravelly, transparently evil tone, while the good guys are all bright, cheery, squeaky and high-pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball. It's like a parody of the games that had come before, but I won't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose.  Overall, Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package, strapped to the shell of a far-below-average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. At the time of its release, it was still in need of a lot of polishing, some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re-evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half-hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality. On top of that, I really don't know which audience they were targeting with it. The game is ridiculously difficult, which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there, but so bright, kid-friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day. The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx, reaching near-Marvel vs. Capcom 2 levels with its unashamed, excruciatingly cheap hits, especially in later levels. I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight.  The game is adequately lengthy, and offers some replay value, with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches, promotional materials and the like. Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super-tough later levels, though, you'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place. Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps (I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process) and enjoy self-mutilation, I'd recommend you stay far away 
 After doing a bunch of research, I bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective Sony CCD that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had.  The first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations.  After a few days of that, the camera dies completely.  The second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease.  One camera . . . a fluke maybe.  But two?  That suggests a real problem so beware. 
 I ordered this toy telescope for my grandson and I am returning it today.  You can see nothing but white light when you look through the telescope, and I really mean nothing!  You cannot adjust the site at all.  Looking through a toilet paper tube would be more fun and less frustrating for any child.  I never review items as a rule, but do not want anyone else spending one red cent on this "toy".  This toy does not deserve one star, but the review would not be accepted without filling in at least one.  
 I haven't received my merchandise. It was sent to Miami and I have moved. My new address is: p.o.b. 73335 providence, RI 02907  phone number:(401) 461-799 
 I have read all of the books Ms. Fluke has written or at least all the Swenson ones.  I find this by far the worst book she has written so far- I think she is taking the whole recipes in the book a little far- every other page was a recipe there was no real story really and am I the only one that is tired of her pretty sister going on and on about how her looks are going to fade type thing BORING- and Hannah needs to decide already who she is going to marry lets get real both of them (Norman and Mike) would have already left her by now- either pick or dump them both.  To say this series is getting stale is an understatement.  Maybe Hannah needs a vacation somewhere where Mike and Norman aren't or her sister Andrea - I was excited to buy this book but could barely finish it - 
 Let's be up straight and honest.  There is nothing really to recommend or like about this movie.  Shot on a shoestring budget way back in 1994, BALKAN RUNNER has a stiff and pondering script full of holes (like how did the hunky hero get unhandcuffed from the dominatrix's claws?), a talentless cast, and a score reminiscent of a 70s cartoon series.  Daisy White is certainly lovely as is Isabel Russinova, but their emotional range is that of a rutabaga.  Paced incredibly slow and with no exciting sequences to brag about, BALKAN RUNNER is one of those movies you've never heard about, and rightly so!! 
 This collection spotlights Warren Ellis and his issues with Superheroes and his consistant need to deconstruct them and in many ways ruin the image that they have had for decades.  Once again we get a heavy dose of the 90's era Punisher Style clones out to prove thier way is the right way.  There's realistic then there is someone with issues.  I've read Stormwatch from the beginning and felt that this issue actually did them a disservice.  This collection rates low, down with Grant Morrisons Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe 
 I found this book extremely disappointing. The author takes a narrow view of how an individual firm can improve its competitive position by 'playing the environmental card'. Although he cites von Weisäcker et al: Factor Four, he does not seem to be aware of the literature that takes a much more systemic view of how to reconcile ecological sustainability, economic efficiency and commercial success. The book is perhaps useful in that it vividly demonstrates the limitations of a perspective that is centered on the individual corporation and its immediate competitive advantage with a rather blinkered view both of the scope for innovation and the wider macroeconomic framework within which business operates 
 If "Havoc" was Anne Hathaway's "all grown-up" vehicle, she needs to check the engine.  Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the "PLC" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the "gangsta" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive "Rocca" wear and and "FUBU" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.  In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.  Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's "Malibu's Most Wanted" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the "PLC" without flinching.  Secondly, had four "innocent" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the "PLC" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.  Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, "Havoc" is a dud.  Unbelievable, uneventful and definitely a rental 
 This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")  This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name 
 I've been using a Mac for the last 10+ years and I had assumed that Windows had gotten better since Win 94.  Boy was I wrong.  It amazes me that the entire world runs on this awful excuse for an OS. 
 The subject of funeral art is fascinating.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing about the book I found interesting.  There was absolutely no character development.  I found myself slogging through the book anxious for it to end.  This just did not work for me 
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
 While it has multiple sizes, the earphones do not fit well. They also do not have clear sound coming through them, unless you press them firmly into your ear. Lots of vibration sound and actually makes it sound like they are blown 
 Well, well well. I thought this book would be a good idea to enligten my beautiful son Seth to my new found alternative lifestyle. I came out just three months ago, after three failed marraiges and one undelivered mail order bride. I gave lil' Seth this book to try to help him understand why  Dwight and Daddy are always going to the golf course in shorts.  Let me  just tell you, Seth won't even look at me now. He's unresponsive to my  fatherly affections and is almost catatonic when I pick him up for my  weekend visits. It's like parenting a turnip. So all I have to say, is wait  until your child sees enough Jerry Springer shows to understand that  Daddy's gay.  In conclusion, I feel that this book has ruined my  relationship with my son - my pride and joy - for the remainder of my  natural life. I think I'm going to have to buy a kitten. In retrospect I  feel I would have had a better chance of showing my son the benifits of my  lifestyle without the aid of your phony book!  Love one another, and try  to be open minded. -James 
 I selected this book based on De Waal's reputation in primatology, interested in his thoughts on the root traits that define our human societies. Instead, he stumbled into politics often enough I finally set the book aside, unwilling to mix an objective study of science with a subjective analysis of world political problems. He could have cited a variety of international examples, but chose to concentrate on the USA and a few others, leaving me uncomfortable about his motives. I suggest he stick to science in his next book 
 Isn't being a female humourist who is also called Fran Lebowitz a little like opening a store selling burgers called McDonalds with a logo that is a big golden M? Luckily I stumbled across this in a second-hand store, leafed through, thought, "Christ, Fran Lebowitz has really lost it", and never bought it. The fact that Fran Lebowitz HAS lost it is purely coincidental 
 this book has all the basics. Good morning, good night, how are you. Most people know this already. If you are going to a spanish country and staying in a nice resort then this book could help. but if you want to learn to speak spanish this is not a very good book for you. 
 Junie B.Jones came back to school and she forgot to do her home work and the teacher called her up in front and told Junie B. what she did for the weekend. I like this book because Junie B. Jones gets a serprice coming for her. I like this book because it's funny   
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 What they don't tell you is that this is not the original recording but a session by "one of the original members" years later. Avoid... 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 We were so excited to order this item. Sadly the quality is very poor. We have had it set up for less than a week and the front "counter" has broken off and one of the front panels has had a leg rip off. My kids love the idea of this item but it is extremely flimsy particle type board -it has basically disintergrated berfore our eyes . Even with general play it sways back and forth, a little scary if little ones are playing in it.I am going to call the maker - hopefully we can repair this (... 
 This book was a little TOO wordy for my taste. I am sure to ALL the FANS of the Hick's absolutely love it, however I did not. That's just my opinion. I am off to the next book. I prefer something that is straight to the point and lewss fluff, if you will. 
 The advice Rand gives writers in this transcription of a series of living room lectures is sound in places: anchor your abstractions in the concrete; remember that art is selectivity; show, don't tell; use actions to illuminate your character, etc, etc, etc. All good advice, to be sure, but to say that Rand is proposing anything new or different from what is taught in writing seminars across the country is a little disingenuous. Add to this her refusal to praise the work of any author besides herself and Victor Hugo, her casual dismissal of prominent writers without convincing evidence (and, even more interesting, the relative paucity of authors she even brings up) and a few didactic guidelines (her ban on profanity, slang, and references less than one century old), and there's rather too much extraneous stuff here to be worth the effort of wading in to try to get to the good bits.  If it's advice you're looking for, there's an excellent essay called "Dogma" in "The Writing Life," a collection of essays and interviews with a number of authors put together by the National Book Award that I found both more helpful and less self-absorbed 
 No, I'm not going to dignify this by elaborating further.  This is just a link in the chain of (giggle) "historial fiction" that currently accounts for DaVinci Code, etc.  It's all been said before, Michael.  HO-hum... 
 The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the "comics" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring.   Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.  Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it 
 I'm with the other reviewers who did not enjoy this.  As I have enjoyed many of Delinsky's other books, I expected a lot more from this.  I was not really engaged in the characters or the story, and found the first person format somewhat jarring for some reason 
 And Suddenly, there was a flash..   and so starts at least 4 battle scenes.  We never learn how the task force gets it's intelligence to be where the terrorists turn up, how they get into position, what planning is done or if there is any plan.  Each time, they just suddenly appear at the right time and surprise the terrorists.    The action in each of the battles is slow. You can almost count the minutes that the task force is standing around idle whilst the terrorists are firing away.. and of course, most of them get away each time.    The dialogue between characters is incredibly weak and could easily have been written by a 14 year old. That is not to insult any 14 year olds, just a comparison to the language that you would expect from a young teenager of today.  Overall, extremely poor written book and boring cartoonish action. 
 "The Skin I'm In" is fabulous, but I don't think this lives up to it at all. The first third of Bang! is an excellent evocation of a family and a neighborhood in decline.   After that, the book itself declines into unbelievable, author-directed silliness. Even if everything that happens to Mann after his father abandons him in the country is taken at face value, I find it impossible to believe that for a whole month no family member and no person in authority thought to look for the boy at the stable where he loved to go daily. A stable that became convienently empty just in time for him to move into it.   And to call the child Mann when the whole book is about rites of passage into manhood is just ludicrous. The final scenes of supposed redemption between Mann and his father are some of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes I have even read in fiction of any type.   The many messages of the novel are worthy, but the novel itself is quite flawed 
 I've never given one star to any type of produce before, but the stupidity of this DVD and its fans are shocking.  So revealing!  So true!  If you didn't know fast food was unhealthy, give me a break.  If you think this is realistic, give me a break.  "Supersize Me" is a piece of propaganda meant to turn people away from eating McDonalds food.  The film documents Morgan Spurlock embarking on a perilous quest to eat three meals of McDonalds per day.  This diet has rules too.  Whenever he is asked if he wants a meal to be Super-Sized, he must do it.  He also much try each item on the menu at least once.  He is only allowed to consume items that are in fact on the menu.  The thing is though, if he is really trying to make a valid point, why does he order the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal twice within the first seven days?  This is questionable, because not only is this the most fatty item on the menu, it also made him vomit the first time that he ate it all.  The thing is though, millions of people (some skinner than Spurlock) have this meal and do not throw up.  Why him?  His wife is a vegan chef and he is used to having no meat in his diet.  So why would he choose the biggest item on the menu TWICE in the first week?  There are many, many other items that he couldn't possibly been able to cover.  Not only that, he almost gets no exercise during the month of this experiment, saying that the average American gets little exercise.  His laziness seems to be an exaggeration.  There is some merit to the movie, showing people how unhealthy McDonalds is, but everyone knows that.  They just don't care.  For Spurlock to in any way (even the subtlest of ways) to support the idiots who sue the fast food chains because they became obese, is ludicrous.  It should be mentioned that Wendy's regular hamburger is a quarter pounder, while McDonalds regular burger is 1/10th of a pound.  Also, Wendy's goes up to a triple quarter pounder, something McDonalds has never done.  Burger King introduced the triple cheese burger and QUADROUPLE cheese burger, something McDonalds has never done.  It seems that McDonalds is picked as a scapegoat because it is the most popular.  This movie may have been more credible if it examined the dangers of fast food as a whole, but just to go up against the one corporation is stupid.  If the movie didn't suggest that the corporation doesn't care about it's customers, I wouldn't have a problem, but it does.  Too much of anything, especially food, is bad for someone.  If anyone needed a movie to tell them that fast food is unhealthy, they clearly are seeing the world through a filter.  1/1 
 Due to Roiphe's insufferable tendency to place each of her personal experiences in the context of global events, I was completely exhaused by chapter two 
 Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details 
 I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get "Born in Ice.&quot 
 There is nothing in this book that an intermediate or higher student doesn't already know.  If your new to Japanese, go for it otherwise don't waste your money 
 I read 'Russian journal' soon after it was published and was thoroughly enarmored both with the content and the style of the book. Having lived in the Soviet Union for many years, I remember being impressed by the ability of the author to understand and convey the nuances of the life and atmosphere in 'mysterious' Russia. I've been watching out for and reading her work ever since. Reading her subsequent books, especially 'Interesting women', a collection of stories, gave me an almost secret pleasure, like I was the only one watching her talent grow and blossom. So I had no apprehension when I started reading her latest. Good thing I borrowed it from the library. The only reason I bothered to finish it is that I couldn't believe it would not redeem itself, at least somewhat, before it ends. It didn't. It has 'tentative, hopeful screenplay' written all over it. But even if someone does option it, it can't possibly make for an interesting movie. It has completely unoriginal and cardboard characters, no plot to speak of, trite situations and language. Yes, sometimes I did encounter some glimpses of Ms Lee's former style and force of observation. But on the whole the book reads more like another romance novel than a work of a talented writer that Ms Lee undoubtedly is. Huge letdown. Did I say pretentious?  And what's with this comparison, on page 80: '(Nick) Tall with his straight fair hair and a face that everyone in his office tells him looks as American as a baby's behind'? For more reasons for my dislike of the book - see review by Vaughn A. Carney. A literary 'one-trick pony' seems like an especially apt description 
 If you are the type that likes happy endings, avoid this movie!  Bruce Willis dies and he doesn't save the world, and the journey to this depressing conclusion is no fun at all.  It reminded me of Arlington Road, where the terrorist uses the good guy to blow up the building at the end of the movie.  Also, in this movie, the repetitive flashbacks to Bruce's airport dream were overdone.  By the 3rd time, I was saying "I got it already", and by the 5th or 6th flashback I was ready to throw something at the screen.  In the featurette, Terry Gilliam said that he thought he had managed to snooker the major studios into producing a "European art movie".  He did, and I hate European art movies.  On the other hand, if you like such things, you'll probably like the film.  It was well acted 
 I honestly love the Avengers.  When it has come to team books I will pick the Avengers over the JLA any day.  However, Bendis was the wrong guy to put at the helm of this book.  Also, David Finch was the wrong person to draw this book.  Finch's art would be good for a book about a solo character who does not have that much of a supporting cast.  Every face looks pretty much the same its ridiculous.  Also, there was a huge editorial mistake made, the Finch drew the wrong man who was supposed to break the arm of Spider-Man, it was supposed to be Pile-Driver not Jigsaw.    Anyways, the art is the least of my concerns with this book.  I dislike strongly the way Bendis wrote this book.  His decompressed style is fine for Ultimate Spider-Man and tolerable for his run on Daredevil, but not this book.  Also, his characterization of Spider-Man I find offensive.  H basically wrote the same Spider-Man from Ultimate Spider-Man into the New Avengers.  If you want to see how these Avengers are really supposed to interact with one another, pick up the Avengers trade in Amazing Spider-Man by J.M.S 
 If I ever:  a) subject myself to this movie ever again  or  b) subject anyone else (including animals) to this movie  Form a mob and follow through with my wish in the title of this review.  Just one question that still haunts me...  How does Travolta's career survive this debacle and Pepper's hits the tank? 
 I am not indicting his theories, but his writing. My God. Buy "Fabric of the Cosmos" by Brian Greene. It covers the same thing (and much more) in a more eloquent and comprehensive manner. Do not buy 
 Not having read any of Vonnegut's work for 30 years, I opened A Man Without a Country and remembered why I'd SO assiduously avoided him. As a natural conservative I much enjoy the thrust and parry of lively political debate. But KV, like almost every socialist I've ever met, doesn't do debate, preferring mockery, innuendo, myth and wilfully distorted facts. It's the superior sneer of the self-styled intellectual who doesn't know what he's talking about. His unwavering belief in doctrinal socialism brings to mind a line from Emerson: "Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."  His defence of Marx, beginning with religion being the opium rather than the opiate of the masses demonstrates his willingness to distort language. That he then manages to blend the benefits of Marxist ideology with the evils of slavery left me moderately bemused. (The American Indian, who cause he champions, was something of a proto-Marxist and quite happily used slaves.) His obsession with slavery and the inference that the United States was uniquely guilty of it is symptomatic of historical revisionism at its most banal. Slavery is a millennia-old, worldwide phenomenon, with a reasonable chance that most of us have distant ancestors who suffered it. But during the period he's most exercised about villainous white slavers didn't mount raids into the interior of Africa, they purchased stock from coastal chieftains who enjoyed vast profits from the sale of fellow Africans. And who, after parliament made not just the trade but the ownership of slaves illegal in Britain, wrote letters of howling protest to the crown that the new law was going to ruin them. Just as Vonnegut ignores the complicity of Africans in the trade, he also omits that it was white European stock that lobbied against and eventually outlawed what had existed in Africa long before the arrival of the first Portuguese explorers, and continued long after it was banned by European and North American governments (or that it still exists amongst the Arabs and West Africans today). Unsurprisingly, he overlooks the enslavement of over a million white Europeans by Barbary corsairs between 1500 and the mid-1800s. Spain and the Italian city states suffered the greatest depredations, but the North African raiders seized thousands of Irish, Cornish and Welsh and not an insignificant number of colonial American seamen. (See Christian slaves, Muslim Masters, Robert Davis, Palgrave MacMillan, 2003)  Vonnegut decries the "135,000" deaths in the bombing of Dresden, deliberately ignoring that German academics now put the figure at closer to 30,000. Which is bad enough, but ol' Kurt not only prefers the discredited number, but makes no mention of the 60,000 British civilians killed between 1940 and 1945 by German bombs, V1s and V2s.  His horror over the deaths of some 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki doesn't include the 300,000 deaths in Nanking to Japanese bullet, bayonet, gang rape, and burning or burying alive, or the three million Chinese who died during the invasion and occupation of their country by Imperial troops. Or that Allied soldiers, PoWs, and enslaved Asian labourers were dying at the hands of the Japanese right up to the day after that big flash over Nagasaki. Balance is not one of Kurt's strengths.  Comparing Americans with Nazis ("And with good reason.") is simply fatuous. Not even the most virulently anti-Bush liberal leftie hyperventilates at the prospect of the USA invading Luxembourg or Andorra.  "Our president is a Christian?" Kurt asks. "So was Adolf Hitler." In fact, Hitler had the same disdain for religion as Marx had. The future Greater Germany was to be religion-free.  His many references to the evil of oil might have at least a hint of resonance if I knew this great sage hasn't driven a car, used the subway, boarded a commercial flight, or used an electrical appliance that wasn't powered by his own wind-driven generator in the last 30 years.   And then...oh hell, there are so many more examples of the woe-is-me-a-lone-voice-in-the-wilderness-that-knows-how-evil-America is. Vonnegut belongs to that genre of Western self-loathers who have benefited enormously from the capitalist system they hate. You'd think he might have considered settling in Sweden. Maybe he was put off by the socialist tax rate he'd have to pay.  
 "Rules of Engagement" tells the story of an heroic fighter-driver flying Phantom jets during the Vuetnam air war.  Brad Austin, an Annapolis grad and the latest in a long line of loyal US servicemen broke with tradition when he joined the Marines instead of following his fathers into the Navy.  Over Vietnam, he chafes at the politically-initiated, and overly restrictive rules of engagement ("ROE"), watching enemy pilots pick off US fliers while shielding themselves behind the ROE.  One of the best aviators in the Marines, he flies his way and barely stays within the ROE as he targets an enemy ace responsible for the deaths of many US fliers.  Soon fed up, he plots one illegal flight which will clearly go over the line.  WHY THIS IS THE WORST BOOK ON THE VN AIR WAR: I gave this novel the benefit of the doubt, even though it quickly proved itself to be no better than an over-glorified and under-inspired rip-off of the far superior "Flight of the Intruder".  The more enjoyable characters and irony of that other book made it the best novel of its genre.  "Rules" drops the ball where "Intruder" got it right, taking a heavy-handed stand on the ROE (they deserve their bad rap, but Steve Coonts wasn't afraid to see the issue from both sides), while not going into great depth about the mechanics of his hero's machine of choice - the F-4.  Next to Jake Grafton, Brad Austin is as lively as an action figure - Weber unwilling to give him any of the flaws or introspection  that made Jake Grafton so believable; Austin's back-seater remains a captive passenger and nowhere near the equal of "Tiger" Cole.  Even the promising idea of having Austin romance the daughter of an anti-war fixture goes nowhere. (I kept waiting for the unhappy dad to tell Austin how he disapproves of his daughter's dating a guy who may get shot down, leaving the poor girl to wonder for years whether he was dead or rotting in a tiger-cage.)  Instead, Weber loads us down with details that don't do anything to substantiate the plot. Austin is a maverick of his family because he chose to fly for the Marines instead of the Navy, a plot twist that's supposed to establish him as a rebel, even though it has him flying the same planes from Navy ships like a Naval Aviator, and facing much of the same challenges.  Even the climactic flight, the one that will break the rules, is a cheat.  While books like these don't mind chiding wartime planners for choosing a strategy that has nothing to do with winning the war, "Rules" easily settles on an epic dogfight against the shadowy Communist ace, one whose result won't have the least effect down on the ground where the war was grinding its way through an entire generation of 19 year olders.  Coonts at least chose a target his characters felt was attached to the war's larger purpose (the Communist party HQ), didn't mind using a plane a whole lot less sexy than the F-4's in "Rules", and granted his characters sufficient self-doubt to question the wisdom of their actions.  Also, there's something a tad dishonest about a book that fights against the insane restrictions of ROE, yet never has its main character get anywhere near having to answer for breaking them.  If you must read a Weber novel, read the sequel: "Target of Opportunity", also an uninspired novel, but one with amore original plot 
 This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy.  I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned.  I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed.  After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.  To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.   
 This DVD is the biggest load of rubbish I have ever seen. It doesn't even deserve ONE STAR!!!!It looks like it was made on a shoestring budget and is presented by a person who seems LESS than qualified. When one buys a DVD like this you expect clarity of instruction, clarity of visuals and above all - content to be presented in such a way that it leaves no doubt or query in the mind of the viewer. This DVD is amteurish, looks like it was shot on a handicam and is nothing short of a retail con job. Don't support inferior quality and misleading marketing. DON'T BUY this DVD!!!! 
 This review is more about the "SuperBit" transfer of the movie to DVD than the movie itself.  The movie itself is great and I highly recommend it.  However, the transfer on to this 2002 "SuperBit" version is very lacking in several areas.  The SUPERBIT idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer.  The original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features (like trailers, documentaries, featurettes, and "Making-Of" snippets) to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality.  They have failed to do that here.  The video and audio quality are not what they could be.  First, the movie is encoded onto a DVD-9 RSDL disc.  This means the DVD is capable of storing 9.5 GB of data.  However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, the video and audio quality is not what it could be.  "Panic Room" is a 112 minute movie.  Any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a DVD-9 disc at maximum encoding rate, provided no extra features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour (or less) movie onto a DVD-9 disc is 9.8 Mbps.  However, this SuperBit version averages only 6.5 Mbps.  This SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1.  At first glance this is great news, until you discover that the DTS encoding isn't as high quality as it could be.  The DD 2.0 Surround is presented at a bitrate of 192bkps as expected.  So is the DD 5.1 at the expected 384kbps rate.  DTS 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps, but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps.  This is unsatisfactory given the fact that one-third of the available disc space of the DVD-9 isn't even used.  The DTS encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this.  This would represent a 33% increase in filespace for the audio portion, but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear.  The filespace increase would be only about 256 MB, which is very reasonable when you have over 3 GB of space not even being used.   If they had encoded "Panic Room" on this SuperBit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 Mbps, and removed the trailers and features, they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above, especially the DTS 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate I stated.    Such an encoding process would have used 9.4 GB of the 9.5 GB of available space.  A much better way to fill up the DVD-9 disc and adhere to the spirit of the SuperBit ideal.  The result would have been a movie encoded to DVD-9 at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc.  I notice that they will be offering a repackaged SuperBit version in October 2006.  Hopefully that version will fix the flaws I just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both video-wise and audio-wise.  It might even offer the better DD-EX 6.1 and DTS-ES 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many A/V receivers can process now.  Another thing I am noticing is that many times, for popular movies, they are released them in 2-disc editions.  The first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff.  If the movie contains both DD and DTS encodings on the first disc, with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 Mbps or greater, it is already in the SuperBit mold. 
 I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.  Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem 
 I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen.  That was a bad decision.  After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed.  The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine.  
 Sojourn is the conclusion of the Dark Elf Trilogy which began with Homeland, continued in Exile and ends here. If you've not read the first two books then I suggest you do so now because the third book is a direct continuation of the other books and you'll be missing out quite a lot by starting here.  Exile was a notch below Homeland. It suffered from poor characters and a very predictable storyline and Sojourn isn't much different. None of the characters from the first two books remain(besides Drizzt of course) so the reader has to deal with a whole new cast. For the most part, these new characters are very one dimensional and similar to the characters in Exile in that there's no attachment to the characters. They're just stage props that Drizzt interacts with before moving on to yet another part of his journey. Characters leave or die out of the blue and they're not very fleshed out. The only decent character Montolio receives almost no development besides a page or two about his past. The author could have spent more time on the characters instead of writing overly long, 10 page battles that go nowhere.   The action returns here in quantity as in the books before. Again, it feels that more of the book is spent in fights than anything else and the battles themselves are completely too long and are littered with many unnecessary descriptions.   The writing too is the worst yet. There are many sentences that just don't read well at all and show a very amateur style. The book itself is very simplisticly written so it will appeal to the younger crowd but if you're looking for some deep, well written fantasy then look elsewhere.   The poor writing, weak and boring characters, and overly long battles are the main downfalls of the book. The world still remains rather interesting with interesting creatures and a lush, although not fully developed world. The story is rather weak too as it just continues on the course exile took. The story is uninspired and nothing much really happens throughout; Drizzt just moves from one place to another with a few small stops and adventures. It's probably the worst part of the Dark Elf Trilogy although the ending does introduce some new characters that may bode well for the Icewind Dale trilogy.  
 I ordered this book and it didn't come, and I said ok send it to me later, adn then it didn't come and I said ok send it later and again and again after four extensions I gave up. This may be a great book or not, but it is not avaiable. I would have liked to have had a cahnce to read it. Disappointed in the service. 
 This album lacks more than just energy, it lacks that surrealisism that we attracted Pink Floyd fans in the first place.  The music itself is technically well played but the vocals are, at best, flat and at times downright pathetic.  With hokey emphasis on specific words that remind me of how perhaps a fourteen year old may sing these songs.  Perhaps it is just me, but the original surreal quality of Pink I always stemmed from the almost "matter of fact" way Waters sang songs like Run like hell.  This album places almost juvenile over emphasis on thier lyrics that destroys the surrealistic style of the original music.  Pink Floyd fans of all types will find this album just plain lacking 
 It is interesting to see all of the gushing reviews of this film.  I found nothing socially relevant, compelling, insightful or even remotely interesting in this film.  The pace is like watching a turtle race and creates a film that IS dull.  There is nothing to like or empathize with in any of the characters.  If your going to waste your time with any of the "Three Colors" films, watch White 
 Even though this is the revised edition, I have been told by professionals in the children's book industry that the information I got from this book is out-of-date and incorrect 
 There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one 
 Wow.  This movie's bad.  But it's good for a laugh if you're in the mood for some brainless fun.  Patrick Bergen gives one of the great over-the-top performances of all time as the psycho husband.  Among the many major plot holes:  Hubby smacks Julia because he thought she was checking out their new neighbor on his boat.  Then a few days later he's arranging for them both to go sailing with the same guy, on his boat!  (Wouldn't the psychotically jealous husband try to keep his wife away from the man he thinks she's lusting after?)  Also, the fact that she would fake her drowning in the OCEAN - but flush her wedding ring (halfway) down the TOILET - is not the smartest move to say the least.  Might wanna just ditch that ring in the ocean while you're faking your own death next time, Julia!  Gotta admit though, I loved that the psycho hubby would sneak into Julia's house and actually take time to rearrange the cans in the cupboard before he hides.  What a neat freak.  The final plot hole involves her new boyfriend in Iowa, who would likely be more interested in Patrick Bergen than Julia, if you know what I'm saying 
 I was really looking forward to reading this novel -- I loved the English Patient (the movie), I had heard wonderful things about Michael Ondaatje and since I live in Toronto, (near the Bloor Viaduct bridge described in the novel), I really did want to like this book. But honestly, I think watching the snow melt in my backyard would have been a more pleasurable experience than reading this book. And  just so you know, I don't generally read fluffy books -- I have a degree in English Literature, so I've read (and enjoyed) my share of ponderous, weighty, well-crafted novels.  I found the first 50 pages one of the most cruelly tedious introductions to a novel I have ever read in my life, but I trudged on and did find brief (all too brief) glimpses of magic. In particular, I was drawn in by the interplay between Clara and Patrick. In fact, Ondaatje is at his best when writing about relationships and at his worst when describing scenes with painstaking, mind-numbing detail. Yes, he's evidently done his research and so, can confidently drone on about the 'rivets, sheering valves and crown pins' involved in bridge building, but quite frankly, who cares?  There were a number of events in this novel that I just found so implausible, as though their only very obvious purpose the furthering of the plot. In particular, the scene where a nun is improbably blown off the edge of the under-construction bridge, only to be magically, single-handedly plucked out of the air by Temelcoff, hanging below in his harness, made me throw down the book in dismay. Then to add to the silliness, although Temelcoff has had his arm "ripped...out of its socket"  by this Superman-type rescue, the two traipse on down-- not to the hospital as one would imagine would be necessary-- but to a Macedonian bar to drink brandy and say not much of anything to each other. Oh brother!  Although others have described Ondaatje's style as lyrical, I just did not feel that at all. I found so much of the writing stilted, choppy and self-conscious. The dialogue  frequently banal and senseless. Here's a random sample: -You awake? -What time is it? she said -Still night. -Ahh. -I love you. Were you ever in love? Apart from Ambrose? -Yeah.   If you want to read a truly talented Canadian author who really does have a lyrical sensibility, read any of Margaret Atwood's books 
 Normally, I like film noir and Clive Owen so I thought the two together would be an unbeatable combination. The premise was provoking enough--the son of a compulsive gambler takes a job as a croupier in a casino to make ends meet. Will the addiction that ruined his father and his family drag him in as well? Is Jack stronger than the siren call of the roulette wheel or does he simply have a different kind of addiction? Unfortunately, these themes of fathers and sons and coming to terms with family history are not well-developed and the story kind of peters out. I was on the verge of turning off the DVD at several points because I was both bored and depressed, but hung in there hoping that it would improve. It didn't. The film makers seemed to think that unnecessary female nudity would make up for the main character failing to have an epiphany. It doesn't. The ending was also confusing. Was Jack's girlfriend killed as payback for the botched robbery or was her death completely unrelated? Bottom line: a lot of good actors are wasted in what is a very unsatisfactory film 
 I got to page 26 and gave up.  Lockes writings lack focus and are void of humour.  I read as much as I could with patience until it became clear this book was simply someone rambling on about nothing.  Save your money for something worth reading 
 Giving this so-called Bible a one is too high.  I love Scripture and have studied the Bible for years, but whenever someone quotes from this version, for me it is like listening to nails scratching a chalkboard.  It is THAT offensive.    The Message is frequently called a "translation" when in actuality it is a paraphrase with one man's interpretation as commentary.  I find that it actually obscures the plain and simple meaning of Scripture, and deliberately puts forth non-Biblical gobbledy-gook, while having the nerve and audacity to be referred to as "God's Word."  Distorting God's Word is a very serious matter, which The Message does all too frequently.  I have found that The Message frequently takes a Bible verse and makes it unrecognizable in form and in content from a good translation.       There are definitely places in The Message that come straight out of New Age dogma and verbiage, one notable example is in The Lord's Prayer.  This is extremely disturbing to me.    Just as no student of Scripture would ever dream of using The Living Bible for study, no student of Scripture should ever consider using this mess as representational of God's Word.  It isn't.  Please don't insult me with stuff like "kindergarten finger-painting" for Hebrews 6:1, or "blessed are they who, when they get to the end of their rope hang on" for a beatitude.  The Bible does NOT say or convey that meaning.             
 Dear, don't buy this hunk o' junk. I got one over the summer, thinking it'd be really convenient, but it doesn't work as it's supposed to, hence the reason a Cuisinart product has gone way down in price to $15.99. The whole brewing mechanism gets very clogged, and even repeated washings with vinegar don't clean it properly. You end up with unevenly distributed cups of coffee (one cup with 10 oz., the other with about 4-6 maybe)with grounds floating in them. Yecch! Try another brand instead or get a more traditional coffeemaker 
 I've read a lot of Ludlum books but this book is so totally "off" in terms of technical authenticity and detail that anyone who understands a little about computers, etc. should stay away - it is just to difficult to read when you can't respect the knowledge of the authors 
 I've been the biggest fan of these guys since I first heard them in 1988.  I'm sure all of my friends hated hearing me rave about them all the time.  I did a two part radio show (12 hours total) celebrating the career of the band a while back.  And I made sure to catch them every time they came to town, even made a couple of road trips to see them.  While others lost interest after Sister or Daydream Nation, I stuck with them and enjoyed all the twists and turns.  Thought Jim O'rourke was a great addition.  But I recently caught them up in Portland (another road trip) and completely wish I hadn't.  The edge is gone.  I really wanted to walk out.  One of the worst concerts I have seen in a while.  Not to mention, all of the new material sounded alike and completely lacked the life of previous material.  I think it's safe to say, that was my last SY concert.  I think they are still doing great things (like All Tomorrow's Parties...bring it back to California!! SF maybe?) and their hearts are in the right place.  But as a band...I don't know what happened.  Maybe it's just something that comes with age and becoming parents...who knows.  But it's been a great 25 (or so) year run.  Thanks for the memories! 
 Initially I was thrilled by 'The Planets' I thought Ms Sobel's style of writing interesting and demonstrative of her love of the subject matter. However the constant biblical references at first surprised and then grated and although the book does have a few awe-inspiring, soundbite-esque facts I felt that it failed to show the real magnificence of the solar system and the physics behind of it.    
 I've read a lot of Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme novels and like them and I thought The Devil's Teardrop which had a different protagonist was excellent.  So when I saw this one in the bookstore, I snapped it up.  Big waste of money!  I couldn't even finish the book, and that is not something that I do very often.  At the very beginning I didn't like the main character at all because he didn't seem the least bit sympathetic to me, although I realize that's simply a matter of personal taste and not something that you can give a bad review for.  More serious was the total "no thought" stereotyping of "bad cops" and local townspeople.  Still not enough to deep eighty-six it, but it was starting to get there at that point.  No, the thing that made me toss this book is that while it is supposed to take place in upstate rural New York, Deaver tried to write this using colloquial English.  Not a problem if he'd used the colloquial speech for the area.  He didn't.  He used the speech of rural areas of Virginia and other areas to the south of NYS.  As a life long resident of upstate rural NY, I felt it insulting to get something that basic wrong and it opened up the whole suspician that nothing else in the book could be right, either, if that's the amount of research he put into it.  It's incredibly lazy writing, and I don't have time to read poor writing.  Too many other really good books out there to waste on a disaster like this one.  Save your money and pass it by, or at least get it used if you feel you must read it.  
 I thought this would have more complete songs--like U2's Rattle and Hum or Styx's Return to Paradise.  Instead it is a documentary with short clips of Jimi performing.  Disappointing.. 
 I am sad to say that I wasted precious summer leisure reading to this book, suggested to me by my wife.  She was not sure what to think of it, and I was to confirm what she couldn't say.  She picked it up because of its "National Book Award Finalist" stamp on the cover and the novelty of the back cover abstract.  The novel begins with so much potential and the writing is especially competent that I couldn't help but feel let down when the whole thing begins to fall apart.  When Egan throws in a wild internet scheme and a mysterious possible terrorist, it is easy to see that she has let the book wander away from its premise.  What could have been an intelligent book about identity gives way to a cheap thriller. 	It makes one wonder about the books chosen for book awards. While this book was only a finalist, I still have to wonder why it would have been in contention.  I certainly don't expect my personal tastes to match those of these committees given the task of choosing the best books, but I do expect to be able to understand the merits of a chosen book, to see what others might see in it.  Did the National Book Award folks decide on ambition alone?  I certainly think Egan began with a topic challenging to author and reader, but doesn't the fact that she fails in her task weigh in the decision?  I suppose I hadn't been let down more by a book in a long time and much of the reason was because of that silver stamp on the cover 
 I was hoping there would be some new info in this book, but there was none. ZIP!!! I still find it interesting that after running a stop sign and killing an innocent driver, that she still has NO comments. None of her friends think it was "a big deal" - that they all just "moved on."  Moved where? In the State of Washington she would be charged with vehicular homicide. It's a serious charge here. I can't help but wonder had it been Hilary Clinton, what the thoughts would be. Lots of reference to her "sorority sisters" - which was annoying. But in a way it helped me to understand exactly where she came from and why she is the way she is today. Don't buy this book 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 With this pup it is simple to record video or images and almost impossible to download them successfully!  In standard mode, the playback of video is anything but smooth.  Looks like an old time movie.    The software could best be described as, "User Hostile".  I haven't been able to download any videos without getting an error message before the transfer is complete.  The normal video isn't as good as my DV camcorders and downright sad indoors.  The photo portion is slightly better than my cell phone (a pocket pc).  Still pictures haven't downloaded successfully either (approximately 11 out of 185 have made it across the wire before error messages start interrupting the transfer).  It's a handy size and easy to operate.  After you're done recording you'll likely spend a lot of time with the manual (I have) and then you start getting frustrated.  If I could return it, I would 
 After watching this DVD disk I found that it was difficult to study man's part. The man on disk dressed on so that the color of his dress and background almost same. You have to pay much attention to separate where his legs are and how he moves. On the other hand, the lady's part has good contrast 
 This was a disappointment obviously generated to cash in on Franken's previous blockbuster on Fat Idiot and Notorious Bush Water Carrier Limbaugh. I struggled through about thirty pages before I started feeling scammed. Then again, the title hints at why this book is so spare and uninteresting 
 No idea why this little nothing of a book is earning such positive recommendations. (Well, I note that one five star review below is by one of the book's co-authors!) It is not really anything more than a one prayer, one page instruction book for the rosary, with the prayer on the right page, a small illustration on the facing page. Do you know the little blue "Pray the Rosary" books by Rev. Lelan, printed since the 1950s by the Catholic Book Co.? Exactly the same idea here, but in a little hardcover, with Medieval icons as the illustrations. Actually it's not even as good as those little give-aways, since they offer memorable little thoughts to help focus the prayer: "I desire forgiveness for my sins," "I desire the virtue of patience," etc. This book does offer brief scriptural readings to accompany each prayer, its true--but then so does a rosary pamphlet I picked up for 50 cents.   Sorry to be so grumpy about it; I was just expecting more. There's nothing wrong with this book per se. It just doesn't offer anything that you can't get elsewhere in free or nearly free Catholic publications.   Additional Gripe: Notice how glorious and grand the illustrations seem if you preview this book with the Search Inside feature. But this book is about 3" by 5", so the pictures are around 2" by 3", about the size of a wallet photograph 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 My first review of this book is the Customer Review dated June 6, 2000. Without retracting anything I wrote in that review or my rating of the book, I would like to supplement my first review by suggesting three "entry-points" into the book for serious-minded readers:  (1) Mr. Fogel writes on page 10 - 'Technological advances in distilling reduced the costs of spirits and made it possible for the urban poor to afford immoderate amounts of alcohol. Reductions in the cost of ocean transportation brought huge waves of immigrants into American labor markets, lowering wages and promoting urban unemployment.' (From roughly 1875 through 1914.)  Consider the perspective of a social scientist who acknowledges the massive destitution of the early twentieth century's workers and their families in America (see next paragraph), but who finds remarkable causally the cheap ocean transportation rates paid by immigrants and their immoderate alcohol consumption in America; and who nowhere mentions either the industrial magnates who benefited -- not coincidentally -- from those two phenomenon, or the American labor movement which was fought most effectively for years by those magnates using those immigrants as scabs and strikebreakers. Maybe it's time to stop thinking of Robert Fogel as a historian, and consider him simply a practitioner of the world's greatest pseudo-science, economics.  (2) Mr. Fogel writes on page 177 - 'The new equity issues in the United States do not arise from the shocks of rapid urbanization, the destruction of small businesses by competition from industrial giants, the massive destitution created by the prolonged unemployment of up to one-quarter of prime-aged workers, the disappearance of the frontier as a safety valve for urban unemployment and poverty, or the undernutrition and premature death of the great majority of urban workers and their family members. Quite the contrary, the new issues are to a large extent the product of the solutions to these problems achieved by a combination of economic growth and the success of the reforms advocated by the Social Gospelers, their allies, and their successors.'  Imagine what Mr. Fogel means by the word 'solutions.' And in light of the facts described in the book American Apartheid, for example, consider which population(s) suffering "urban unemployment and poverty" Mr. Fogel thinks have had their problems solved by economic growth and the reforms advocated by the Social Gospelers, etc.  (3) Mr. Fogel writes on page 180 - '....the reform agenda spelled out by the religious Right......more fully addresses the new issues of egalitarianism than does the Agenda of the Third Great Awakening.' (The T.G.A. being the widespread reforms in America beginning at the end of the nineteenth century which led to the rise of the welfare state and policies to promote diversity.)  Imagine what Mr. Fogel means by the word 'egalitarianism. 
 I think claims like these would have gotten the two countries into war in the old, old days.  "Finest Japanese blade steel" on all the knives... but, on the box there is a clear plastic label that says (hold your breath) "Made in China."  I think Amazon should make it clear just where these are from. I think they are good knives... and I bought the five piece set for $60 on the Gold Box deal. No doubt they are worth that much... but, more? I don't know.. 
 I had to return this album to Amazon after receiving an emil from them stating that it contained Sony malware.  Poor Jane! Caught up with these creeps!  
 I love to bake, but this book is not baker friendly. Most of the recipes roll over to the next page and the small type is not easy to quickly glance at while preparing. I'm sure there are great recipes in there, but I prefer a cookbook with quality and easier to use.  
 This book was written for a University Professor, not a busy public school-teacher, with freshman-college-aged students, not little kids. If this is the author's idea of Elementary School Art, I can only imagine what her Secondary School book is like. Great book, just not keeping with the title 
 Admittedly, I used Office 98 and bought this book primarily because it is the only one now available. I had a number of questions, including what did the new shapes the cursor assumed mean, and do.   Almost none of my questions were answered. There were not nearly enough visual images or screenshots to make explanations clear, and the level was so basic that I'm not sure who would get that much out of the book, rather than Office's own help system. It's a shame, because the help in this version of Office seems useless, far worse than the previous version.  Maybe some of the upcoming books will be better 
 I've enjoyed both "sides" of Sugar Ray, the breezy Fly / Every Morning side and harder-edged RPM side.  I though Floored was great, and 14:59 softer overall but still great.  However, this self-titled album is just not that interesting.  Only the hit When It's Over caught my attention, and the rest of the songs just feel like mushy top-40 radio crap.  (Of course Fly was top-40, but I never considered it crap.)  There is little of the edge, humor, or fun of previous Sugar Ray CDs on this release.    If you have the two popular albums already, I would suggest that Lemonade and Brownies is a much more interesting and fun (and LOUDER and raunchier) CD than this one 
 Jennifer Lopez is a has been and Jane Fond is has been had too many times.  The "stars" just refuse to retire and enjoy their money.  Jane, get married again and drift off into oblivion.  Jen, take some of your millions and open a finishing school for underprivileged hispanic girls, something like Saint Operah is doing for her people.  The world would be a better place if the privileged would spread their wealth around.  Anyway, the movie is your standard schlock that the movie industry is grinding out these days since they ran out a talent about 10 years ago.  enjoy 
 I was hoping for a story (my baby is named Zoe) but instead it is another standard Alphabet book only featuring children with names that try way too hard to be diverse.  Maybe my baby will grow into the illustrations, but right now she is confused by them 
 this shampoo made my dandruff even worse.  after using it, it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed, but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it.  if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell's tea tree shampoo or something.  
 I wouldn't recommend this book at all for one your better off going to see the movie because the book tells a whole bunch of different stories which leads you in different storis instead of just talking about the same thing the whole movie. I would just recommed seeing the movie over the book 
 I'll be the first to admit that the Carlyle Group seems to "work" the system...perhaps even abuse it to profit from their "connections" to goverment.  And yes, they've done a few thing most people would find to be inappropriate.  However the author's case would have been much more compelling had he simply stated the facts and not editorialized so much.  The result makes you feel like it's a crackpot conspiracy theory.  His liberal use of adjectives and obvious melodrama to make us think something horribly sinister is afoot made me bitter toward journalists, rather than his intended target, the Carlyle Group.   Typical of the news media today: he couldn't just report the facts...he had to color it with his political (or paranoid) biases 
 The content is excellent.  The digital format is largely useless.  I bought the digital 5th edition to supplement my paper 4th edition.  But, the digital rights management restrictions mean that I can't print selected pages to stick in a folder, read on the train, or scribble notes on.  I can't even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic 'notes' file.    The onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one 
 As much as I would like to recommend this movie, I have to admit it is not one of the best movies of Jesus life. It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.  That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.  If you what the best Jesus movie ever done, nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.  The two other parts to this series, Acts and John, are done very well. 
 This pair of authors has no credibility in the Vajrayana community, mostly because they just make it up as they go along. Publishing books like this is their way of making money and trying to gain credibility. (If Shambhala publishes us, we're as legit as anyone else Shambhala publishes, right?)  Um, no.  If you are interested in the specific topics Chogyam and "consort" flail away at in this volume, see Magic Dance by Thinley Norbu. His book is much shorter, because he knows what he's talking about and he's not just inventing nonsense.  Interested in Tantric Buddhism generally?  See Gates to Buddhist Practice, by Chagdud Tulku, and The Buddha from Dolpo by Cyrus Stearns. Or anything by Chogyam Trungpa.  One may assume my aversion to this "teaching" is a symptom of a generalized aversion to "controversial teachers." Hardly.  The trouble with Aro gTer? Their controversial leaders aren't teachers at all 
 I do not know why he decided to recycle his "Long Term Secrets to Short Term Trading" book. He is selling the same old stuff in a new book with a different name. Even the examples and the explanations of his setups are word to word the same. Nothing new at all. No need to buy the book 
 I love historical fiction and found the premise behind this book compelling enough to want to read it. The plot was easy enough to follow: an exiled queen befriends a recently freed slave (once a prince in his own country) and the two secretly marry and have a child together. This part of the story was interesting and compelling enough to make me want to read on, but the long religious dissertations and never-ending references to upcoming war and the complexities of European politics at the time often left me confused and bored. A geneology chart and a short explanation of the time's politics at the beginning of the book would have been extremely helpful. In addition, the author seems to have a strong preference to elaborate details and conversations with huge, fancy words. I can't imagine that these people would actually use them in daily conversations and it only added to the tediousness of trying to get through the story. Simpler wording and language would have made for an easier and more pleasant read and would not have taken anything away from the storyline.  This book was immediately sold to a used bookstore when I finished it. I would have loved to continue on reading the rest of the trilogy, but don't have the time to be so taxed in my reading efforts 
 Out of fairness, I should tell you that I didn't listen to the whole audiobook.  I got about 1/2 way though the first CD and just couldn't stand it anymore.  What I heard was boring and extremely slow moving.  It's read like a "see spot run" story for children, which makes the boring storyline even more boring and I found it to be a bit insulting.  I think an audio book of names and nummbers in the phone book would be more exciting.  Maybe it gets better as it goes along, but I am not willing to endure any more to find out.    
 After weeks of delaying my shipment I was told Amazon could not get the book for me .. 
 This is my favorite magazine in the universe and the only one to which I have ever subscribed. However, after this, my second subscription is over, I plan to call it quits. The magazine never gets delivered unless I send several angry e-mails every month reminding them and demanding delivery. When the issues come they are often 2-3 months behind. The current issue is over three weeks late and who knows when and if I will ever see it. In the end, although this is a brilliant publication, it simply isn't worth the headache. Photo, if you're out there, please forward me the June issue.... and while you're at it get a head start on July and August and maybe they'll make it on time 
 I expected a more out or a historian like Romila Thapar. The whole book looks like biased Indian culture bashing boring read.  The information sources and references seem like they have been picked specially for a pool of India hating English historians library.  The real essence of Indian culture which has bought into this world Vedas, Yoga and beautiful art forms seems to be completely missing.  Definitely not a read for a person getting introduced to Indian culture (Wrong Views), informationless for a knowledge seeker (Colorless Views) 
 Many useful, if obvious, ideas here but more often than not it's "my way or the highway." The author has little tolerance for those of us who prefer a certain amount of "chaos" at work. Look elsewhere  before making yourself guilty about your office habits. "Ergonomic  Living" offers a much more realistic and thoughtful approach to the  "real world" modern office 
 Part of the problem I think, is that this book was poorly and deceptively marketed. The blurbs about the work gives one the impression that this IN-DEPTH, high-quality information about American religious experience. What it ACTUALLY is, is a history of everything that this author thinks is important about American CHRISTIAN history. Seriously, would it have busted his BUTT to MENTION non-Protestant religions? There's a Christian Science Church in nearly every US city. Did he fail to mention that just because their numbers are small? There are thousands of Native American religious communities who believe differently than Protestants and Catholics altogether. I understand why he wouldn't go very deeply, but why ignore them entirely?  What about New Thought offshoots of Christian Science- Unity School, Science of Mind, Religious Science and others? These beliefs came largely from the New England Transcendentalist movement. Isn't that at least interesting from a historical perspective?  And this is to say nothing of his crummy, "religious literacy dictionary," which as poorly educated as we Americans are all supposed to be, could have been compiled by a twelve-year-old for a research project.  The author TALKED ABOUT religious liberalism in his book, but didn't bother to DEFINE it in his, "dictionary." And liberalism of ALL types is probably the most poorly understood concept in the nation today. He claimed he was going to tell us all the subtle differences between religious beliefs, and he simply didn't.   Seriously, I can't help but wonder if he didn't just get TIRED of writing and decide, "OK, dammit, that's enough. I'm DONE."  I think that Stephen Prothero did exactly the OPPOSITE of what he claimed he intended to do: provide an in-depth and comprehensive description of American Religion.  Too bad. I love this topic. 
 My mother purchased this book for me. I think it was an "Oh, but she means well" type thing. I spent some time looking over the book and decided there are few things I have ever read that are more off track.   The authors disguise biased, overgeneralized stereotypes of how all men and women act with really cute and catchy graphics. They tell you what to do and how to act so that you can attract a lasting mate. Because we all know trying to change yourself or hide parts of yourself to impress someone else is the best way to develop an emotional and intimate connection. The back of the book says playfully, "Oh, great, another one of those dating books, right? Wrong!" Actually, yeah, that's pretty right. Except I'd rather read all those other dating books.    
 I DONT NORMALLY RATE BOOKS WITH SUBSTANCE SO LOW - SO I THINK IT WAS JUST ME.  THE BOOK DID NOT KEEP MY INTEREST I FELT LIKE I WAS IN CLASS. NOTHING ABOUT IT REALLY STOOD OUT FOR ME.  IT DID STATE GOOD FACTS AND REASONS BUT NOTHING ABOUT IT WAS PHENOMENAL. 
 Jane Smiley's _A_Thousand_Acres_ had a great deal of potential.  It had a powerful plot (King Lear) that has been little-adapted in modern times.  Smiley chose an interesting and rich setting in her modern day heartland farm.  However, the actual execution of the book leaves much to be desired.  First and foremost, Smiley writes exactly like a writer who has just completed a college writing program.  She uses smart and subtle humor (one may say wit), metaphors and similes.  The problem is that one is conscious at each and every juncture that she is using a simile, a metaphor, or a quip.  While more seasoned writers might have woven beauty into readable text or else have chosen to complexify and engage a reader, instead she chose a middleground that is neither challenging nor readable.  The reader constantly is forced to swallow some rather ridiculous metaphors, all the while conscious that they are swallowing a textbook, but ridiculous, metaphor.  And while the plot taken from Shakespeare had a lot of potential, it was handled quite inexpertly.  Yes, Smiley chose the intelligent path and abandoned Lear about 3/4 of the way through (so that everyone doesn't die).  However, once again, she writes in a way that makes every reader -conscious- that she is adapting Shakespeare, and at times the plot seems ridiculous in its current setting.  Yes, she sheds new light (the protagonist is the Goneril-character, who was a Shakespearean antagonist) in a very intriguing way.  Yes, she invents new excuses for her behavior (former child abuse)... however, had she not tried so hard to make the reader conscious that she was adapting Shakespeare, these plausable interpretations might not have seemed -in-plausable.  All in all, a book with many potent seeds that were not sown to anything near their full value 
 You can get the old vintage aggravation games on Ebay for 10 or less and theres also some hand-made wooden boards as well. These new versions dont hold a candle to the old ones, Just as old tvs seem better than some of the new ones 
 My daughter loves to do ballet and wanted this toy soooo badly. Unfortunately shortly after recieving it we could not get it to do the ballet. The pin isn't working. She was soo cute all dressed to do ballet with Dora and it wouldn't work. The look on her face was heartbreaking. Don't waste your money 
 Reading this pamphlet is one way to spend 20 minutes. However your 20 minutes would be better spent searching online for a book with a bit more "meat" on Japanese carriers 
 I did not find this book helpful at all.  I guess I should have known better, but I thought maybe it would have one piece of useful information.  It didn't 
 I'm not sure what I expected, but I vaguely remember James Frey, author of "A Million Little Pieces" saying this was one of his top five reads; I couldn't believe it!  I must confess that my mother and I (she's a young 83, I'm 48) have created our own little "Book Club" that is bi-coastal - it gives us one more thing to talk about when we chat on the phone.  At least she finished it; disappointed!  Every time I picked it up it seemed to wander aimlesslesly from one subject to the other, without much regard to the pace.  I felt I was constantly on siesta!  From now on we're sticking to the classics - this felt utterly pointless 
 I so wanted to like this book as I had a great interest in this case and it's Mormon perspective.  Unfortunately many facts were glossed over and it seemed glib.  There was no real character development.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you are looking for a very fundamental view of this highly publicized murder 
      Despite its lofty status as a revered icon of English literature, one only has to fight through a dozen or so pages to reach the painfully obivious conclusion that Ulysses is, in fact, unreadable gibberish.      The book has no plot, no dramatic arc, no message, a (literally) pedestrian structure, and sentences constructed by means of a random walk through the dictionary as well as through Dublin, Ireland.  It has no discernable central thought.  No one can tell you what the book is about, for it is about nothing.  But wait, perhaps there is an underlying theme, albeit one well hidden.      Remember the fable of the Emperor's new clothes?  Guillible courtiers were induced to beleive that a charlatan tailor had sewn garments for the Emperor that only suitably refined folk could see.  In reality, there was nothing there at all.  Jame Joyce and generations of literary sycophants have convinced impressionable students that Ulysses is a worthy read.      When the uninitiaed find the text incoherent, this failure is chalked up to insufficient literary maturity.  It can't be the fault of the book's alcohol-addled author.      "Press on," the professors say, "Ulysses' gloss will be revealed if only one perseveres past the many opaque chapters, thus developing the right sensitivities."      However, looking longer at this nonsense only reveals the glaring absense of rational content and the transparent emptiness.  The self-indulgent Emperor Joyce has no clothes.      The most damming indictment of this over-wrought tome is the fact that it is impossible to find ten people who have actually finished it.  Ulysses is one of those books that everyone has heard of, but no one has read.  Hence the market for Ulysses crib cards for use at cocktail parties by poseurs with literary pretensions or by guys with dates with English Lit chicks whom they are trying to bed.  Perhaps Ulysses has some tactical utility after all, as an example of inverse Chick Lit.      One supposes that the stream-of-consciousness descriptions of nose picking, masturbation, and sex broke ground for serious literature when published in the 1920's.  Joyce deserves some credit for expanding the gross horizons of writing, but today's target audiences find those subjects ordinary and routine.  This taboo-breaking history is hardly sufficient reason to examine Ulysses now.  To be timeless literature, a book must speak to fundamental truths about ourselves.      But what, if anything, does Ulysses tell us about the human condition?  I suggest its plot-free message is one Joyce didn't, or couldn't, intend.  That is; to trust one's educated common sense.  If, to you, a book walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it was most likely written by a quack.      If this stream-of-consciousness genre appeals to you, for a much better read get anything by Hunter S. Thompson.  Dr. Gonzo's book will be more coherent, make more sense, and will be better crafted.  And, your eyes won't glaze over after ten pages, as they will with Ulysses.     
 I have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational. Recently I have subscribed to Shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer. Its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks !!!! 
 First of all, when I think of someone in law enforcement or in a government involved job, especially negotiating, I think of someone really tough. With that kind of job, you have to be. The main character was an enormous whimp. In a book centered around a character in the middle of the crossfire and involved in a job as dangerous as negotiating, that is unacceptable. If she gets squeamish after only one job, well then, how'd she get where she was in the first place? Her negotiating tactics and attempts at talking with the bad guy were pathetic. Also in that horrendous scene was the moment when she met the main male character in the book. I never knew that I would gag so much in just a couple of paragraphs alone. On one side there's the author constantly praising the main characters so-called fearless attitude and on the other the guy in the story's doing the exact same thing. I found it all to be quite disgusting.   I didn't like the main character. And then there were the conversations: who talks like that? Everything about the entire story was so unrealistic, the plot, characters, storyline, dialogue...And it seemed as if every other paragraph they were getting something to eat. I have never read another book where they ate more. They ate more than I do in the time it takes me to read ten books, much less a single one.  I have noticed a pattern with Dee Henderson. Her female characters are always extremely dependant on their male heroes. They seem to turn to mush around them, so if you're looking for a strong female character, turn around and look somewhere else.    Overall: One of the most annoying books I have read in a long time 
 As a shaman myself I was appalled when I began reading this book only to discover that entheogens--THE VERY SOLE FOUNDATION FOR SHAMANISM ITSELF--are not mentioned once--not once.  Somehow this book is 600 pages of information about shamanism while not informing the reader of its actual basis.  What a blunder that this is supposed to be a definitive textbook on this religion and some poor people have read this book and considered themselves learned in shamanism.  It needs to be taken off the shelf 
 Terrific as in terrible. The photography was nice. I can handle an odd story line and unconventional ending as long as there is an actual plot -- which this movie lacked. Actually the ending was quite a relief since it did relate to something in the movie. The only 10 minutes that did! Really, if I hadn't paid I would have asked for my money back. And it was only $3.99 
 mazon. I ordered 4 for xmas dinner, was sent three and they cancelled the 4th one saying the will never get it in.  Thanks Amazon 
 So sad I spent the money on this book.  Poor writing, comedic style that simply isn't funny, unrealistic and trite dialogue, foundering story line... I'm a third of the way through the book and no one has died yet and nothing's been stolen--there's no mystery yet!  I too have a Mennonite heritage and my relatives would kick her right out of Hernia for her blase' attitude about her religion... I picked up the book hoping for some simple, clean fun taking place in a familiar community.  Instead I was irritated and bored.  Sorry, but no dice.  Won't even be finishing this terrible book.  Run away 
 You can't have fear and faith at the same time. Wake up 
    At the height of socialist popularism in England, cir. 1944,  George Orwell, a leading proponent of socialism, believing in its promises as did many,if not most of Eurpose's leading intellectuals and politicians, wrote a review of Hayek's famous book, "The Road to Serfdom."  Orwell wrote the review in the "Observer," London April 9,1944.    Hayek, mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his classic book, "The Constitution of Liberty" published in 1960, as evidence of the disillusionment of socialist intellectuals, when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually exclusive. Those same intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book, "Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion" (1940).  Mannheim had been a long opponent of socialism, but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to "The Road to Serfdom."  By 1960, when Orwell had become a world renowned author and staunch opponent of Big Brother doublespeak, Hayek recognized that the political proponents of socialsm which was dying as a political ideal, were now introducing the concept of the welfare state.       While virtually everyone alive today have been effected by Orwell's works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother, how many of us are aware of Hayek's infulence on him?       "The Constitution of Liberty" provides its readers with an enormous wealth of knowledge, of which this one footnote is only a small example.  Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them, and this is one of the main lessons to be learned about "liberty" which requires the "rule of Law" to exist in today's society, but that Rule of Law must be understood.  The failure of today's inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world full of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations.       Unfortunately, Hayek is no longer alive to help guide us through the new millenium.  Fortunately, he has left us a large volume of work, perhaps more relevant today than it was when written years ago.  While "The Constitution of Liberty" is voluminous in itself, it should be kept as a reference book.  Hayek's other works, "The Road to Serfdom" and his last published volume, "Fatal Conceit-the Evils of Socialism" published in 1980 is a magnificent continuation of Hayek's life long discertation on the evolution of mankind's growth from a tribal, familial society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty, to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens, but only moderately understood, so that such a great and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell.    Hayek's understanding that Western Civilization has prospered from individualism, that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel, to trade, to exchnge property, material, real and intellectual.  He explains why man must be humble, that humans progress from trial and error, not from conceited belief that one way or another way is correct.  That to be free and liberated is to be free to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals'rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their own ideals and beliefs.      
 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STEER CLEAR OF THIS ITEM!!!! The listing advertises two 10 lbs weights, however you'll ACTUALLY receive two 5 lbs. weight sets. These weights are actually sand, rather than the iron tubes you get in most other sets. I received a set that was ruptured and leaking sand so I had to return them. But it was for the best because the advertising on these are misleading anyway.  The set is bulky and not particularly comfortable. Furthermore, these can't be all that durable either. Finally, these are the most expensive 10 lbs ankle weights that I've seen thus far. You'd be better off with anything other than these

 This test isn't very accurate and it takes forever to do. I bought the book for an IRI project I had in class. Some of the scoring issues are not clear and students may score lower when they just don't feel like reading or if they don't feel like paying attention. This may be true for other tests also, but is much more apparent with this. It may be good to use this book as an assessment tool, but do not use the test scores when it comes to the student's records or IEP 
 I purchased two units--one for our home and one for our vacation home.  Within a few days, the unit at home was no longer making good crema.  The water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses.  I'm sending both units back and buying another brand.  If they had worked properly, I'm not sure I would have like them even then.  The design of this unit is "odd".  I've had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird.  If you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew, the grounds and steam explode all over.  I also suspect that the thermostat is broken.  It allows the water to boil--which does not make tasty coffee.  Overall, I hate this unit.  I'm going back to shopping 
 Bo was my favorite Idol contestant last year.  So, I couldn't wait to get his first album.  Before this album came out, I was going to buy the two song CD, with Vehicle and Inside Your Heaven, but I didn't buy it because I figured, why waste my money on only 2 songs.  I figured the album would be better.   I was wrong.  When my daughter and I listened to the CD for the first time, we were dissapointed.  Every song sounds pretty much the same  - white washed cookie cutter pop.   The cd has been sitting around my van unlistened to every since.  I was hoping to hear some Southern rock style or classic rock style tunes or something at least close to that.  Maybe it's because he's new to the industry and hasn't figured out how to work the business yet.  I hope he changes and gets some real good music out soon. 
 The seller made a mistake and did not have the title in stock. They had later sent me an e-mail apologizing for the error and credited my account. 
  Unless you are an immature tramp I cannot fathom how you could enjoy, relate or even read this nonsense. The style and to a lesser extent the story hold merit on a historical basis, but the plot is dated and obscured to the wanna-feel-empowered nobodies of the world. That people think this is a great book betrays how foolish the reading public are; seriously, just stick to what Oprah tells you to read, or better, simply plop down in front of the television and watch 'reality.'   I am not saying this is not an important book; it is. But if you think it possesses literary Quality, read 'Confessions of Nat Turner,' 'Go Tell It On the Mountain,' 'The Invisible Man,' 'Native Son,' and tell me that this book belongs in the same class of fiction as these novels.  Am I biased? Yes, completely, I think that the work of women does not compare favorably to what men have achieved in letters. I mean, "Atlas Shrugged" is one of the most horrid things mankind has produced! But there is the converse....I mean, how many great wives, how many good stay-at-home moms have been men 
 They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up). These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used. The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK.  I am going to return these package to Amazon.  
 Ms. Headley really does seem to be just thrilled with herself.  That's fine, but I was far too bored with her life to want to keep reading 
 Well, this CD is okay but unfortunately the two tunes that they released on the radio are probably the best on the CD 
 "Good morning class.  Today we are going to learn about a trillion different kinds of rocks.  Now the softest rock on the Mohs scale is talc...  The hardest rock is diamond."  At this point in time I am snoring really loudly on my desk and dreaming about the second I get out of the class.  Annie Dillard, you have just been the teacher of that class.  You taught me all about rocks, jokes, dancing, and rebellion.  All of this stuff I either know about or don't care about.    This book provokes a lot of emotions in me - emotions that can otherwise only be felt when a family member has died.  Just to look at this book brings my eyes so much pain that, if I look at it again, I will most definitely go blind.  Writing this review has really made me learn to appreciate good books, and to never take books at face value.  I have read some reviews on this book and many of them hailed it as "amazing".  Never in the course of my life will I ever believe a review on anything to do with culture.  This book gave me a prophetic epiphany and, seeing as I am an atheist, I do not normally get those.  During my sleep a demon came to me and shoved this book into my face.  In the night, I woke up with a searing pain in my head that would not go away for hours and my vision has been slightly impaired since.  This is no joke.  I am sure there is a psychological explanation for this, but whenever I pick up the book I get a feeling of nausea.  The book lacks cohesion, but many other reviewers have already commented on this (so I don't have to).  There is, however, one cohesive element to this book, and that is the title "An American Childhood".  If you do not get a sense that this is a boring book just from the title then you have some incurable issues.  The title describes a childhood in America, and since this book is mostly published in America, many people can relate to it too closely, which takes away the purpose of this book.  Annie Dillard was a normal child so she wrote a normal book.  However, the consumers of the world are not looking for an average product; they are looking for exceptional work.  I am sorry Mrs. Dillard, but this book is normal, you are normal, so that is why you only have a normal average from amazon.com reviewers 
 We bought this toy for our 8 month old daughter in hopes of providing her a fun and shaded pool toy.  When we put her in it she did not fit comfortably in the seat and appeared as if she would tip over (she is on the larger side of babies her same age).  We decided not to test out if she would be stable or not - we went with instinct. Also, it was a breezy day the day we used it and the design of the float allows it to catch the breeze and go quickly across the pool.   I guess we will give her the blow up hammer in another float! 
 The title of the book is very inviting but, unfortunately, the author doesn't prove equal to the challenge of the subject. Mainly, he reiterates ideas of the colonialist-leftist school of Indian history 
 I was expecting accurate information regarding the history of Christmas songs and carols. Instead, Ace Collins has taken some facts about the carols and woven fairytales around them. In some cases he has taken a few facts and assumed results that are erroneous.   Having personally researched "Silent Night" in Austria, I can say for certain that Collins has presented another fanciful story based on some facts and some misconceptions about the world's best-loved carol.   The tale about "The Twelve Days of Christmas" being a secret catechism for Catholics in the period when they were oppressed in England doesn't make any sense. The "secret" Catholic beliefs it supposedly hides are identical to the Protestant beliefs of that era. Therefore there was no reason to keep them secret from Protestants -- 1 =  one God, 2 = Old and New Testament, 3 = gold, frankincense, and myrrh -- and so on.   Sadly, it's just another feel-good Christmas book when it could have been a valuable resource for people wanting accurate information.  
 Back in his day Heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys. Unfortunately, that day is long past, and Heinlein has wandered far from his strength.  This book fills in some gaps from Time Enough for Love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint.  As was the case in Time Enough for Love, sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme. Examples: The two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age.  The male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister, then a young teen, and he, at this point, the oldest man in human history.  To make all this go down easier, the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued, and said to be 'tripped' if she has her way with him.  There is a lot more of this 'weird sex', but I will move on.  This is not really a science fiction story per se, but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story.  Most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid America.  There isn't really a plot.  The book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine, seemingly Heinlein's feminine ideal.  It is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career.  This book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author.  
 The charicters of both Elizabeth and Darcy behave in a manner I would never have expected them to be so stupid as to do.  These are two people of sense, to have them behave in such a ridiculous manner had me shaking my head and asking myself how much the author read Austin's work.  My guess was either very little or with very little understanding.  I was extremely dissappointed 
 This book is very similar to what is known as a 'review of the literature' found in academic journals. The Crash was first and foremost a financial event but Klein does not really address finance other than to survey what people thought. I get no feel for what may have caused the Crash nor do I walk away feeling educated about the period. It has all been done better before, namely Galbraith and F.L. Allen in their own way. Historians need to know more finance before tackling this topic which is why Klein does not succeed 
 Wittgenstein said that the purpose of a popularization is to make people think they understand something they don't understand.  What seems to be a common current of science popularizations is that they "explain" things in such a simplified way that the reader who actually wants to get down to brass tacks is completely mystified.    Einstein's book on relativity is a case in point, as is this book in which the candid reader is informed that "Objects at rest tend to remain at rest, therefore heavier objects will fall faster in a gravitational field."  Got that?  If so, maybe you can explain it to me.  Listen, I know something about Physics.  Back in the seventies I built a particle accelerator out of a blow drier and a box of Mike and Ikes.  
 I've had two of these.  Both sounded and worked well for a few months.  then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second.  When this happens, you're perfectly operating  earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery.  While it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of "memory titanum" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium I bet)   Skip by this one if you're smart.  I've been had twice 
 I bought this while pregnant hoping for a light read, and somene to say "it's really not so bad.".  I didn't get that from this book.  Instead, I felt the author was constantly whining about every little annoyance with her pregnancy and new parenthood.  (Trying to do this humorously is still whining.) From complaining she had no time to herself, to lamenting that it was taking her forever to lose her pregnancy weight.  At the end of every chapter, she would write some sort of sappy cliche about her baby, as if that made up for all the previous grousing.   This book did nothing to encourage me or make me look forward to being a mom.  It did make me dread the birth of my baby, but now that I am 6 months into motherhood, I have found it really ISN'T that bad.  : 
 I happen to think that "Funcrusherplus" may be the best hip-hop album ever. For those of you who are fans of Company Flow, the "Little Johnny From..." album, will be a huge disappointment. For those of you wanting to MC, pick it up and get some good beats. Don't waste you time other wise. Without the tight lyrics from El-P and Bigg Jus the album is nothing more then a reminder that Co. Flow has a strong original sound. Don't waste your money, get something you'll actually listen to 
 I've been had is all I can say, after reading other reviews I really thought this would be an interesting, exciting movie. Instead, the story is lame, the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so NOT scary or at least gripping. I watched the whole thing as I thought maybe I am missing something, but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end. Sorry guys, but this is nowhere near, Audition, Tale of two Sisters or even Whispering Corridors 
 I just wanted to point out that I own this book too; and that I share the sentiments of the other reviewer 
  I bought this puzzle book for my son's birthday because he loves puzzles.  He opened up the book and found that one of the puzzle pieces was already missing.  After a few times playing with it, the pictures, which are glued to the magnets, started to fall off. I am constantly trying to fix this puzzle.  It is currently hidden from my son to allow me the time to fix all the pieces. The puzzle book is a great concept, but the quality is very disappointing 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 I was at my cousan's house and we were listenening to these old tapes that were in a shobox. It was really funny. This is nothing like the music or today. This is the music you hear in groshery stores. We also listened to pink floyd the wall, dark side of the moon, and the first cut. These were a little better becuase they sound all angry and loud and how they hate school. 
 i haven't read the book,but if you have a whole chaptyer on fusaichi pegasus,who turned out to be a dud,why should i.the only animal voted among the greatest athletes in the 20th century even ahead of my idol mickey mantle,the greatest natural baseball talent we humans ever saw,was secretariat!he sprinted the belmont,with no one around him,he hit the mile at 1:34,and as the daily racing form said,into a strong wind down the stretch and hit the wire at 2:24 flat.maryland still denies him the stakes record at the preakness by two seconds.so why doesn't he appear in the table of contents 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 We use Gallup at my workplace.  Gallup is an excellent organization and we're better for working with them.  However, this was too much.  It's not a book.  It's a brochure.  Their Engagement Index is brilliant, but you can skim the other 260 pages without missing anything important.    
 in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"     more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!! 
 Like an earlier reviewer, I still have about 80 pages to go on this book, but at this point I don't really care who done it, what they done, or why.  I'm a big fan of the Alex Delaware novels, but the usual strengths of that series are nowhere to be found in this book.    Mostly, it's too complicated both in plot and number of characters.  I'll read a couple of chapters and six new names are introduced.  By the time I pick up the book again, I've forgotten who they are talking about.  Some of it is truly gratuitous, such as foster or step-children whose names are different from their parents or guardians.  I need this one as an e-book so I could search back and find out who the heck all these people are.   If I wanted to work this hard at reading, I'd go dig out War and Peace 
 Don't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good.  Traffic UR Adagio For Strings Nyana  Those songs are just great and the best off the album. But songs like  Walking On Clouds Sweet Misery Love Comes Again Forever Today  can only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though.  No song here is annoying in the beginning and I see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for Dj Tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it.  Cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff.  Dj Tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 Dj I expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoying  Verdict: 2.8 out of 5.0 Not bad for the first 20 listens but damn I could have enjoyed it much more 
 This book was such a huge disappointment. Having experienced the good and bad sides of mommy cliques, I thought the idea of this book was so great and I was really looking forward to reading it.  Unfortunately, this wasn't a funny and inspired take on the "insanity of motherhood" at all.  It was a judgmental and mean-spirited attack on what seemed to be as many women as the author could think of.  I had to force myself to finish it, and only did so in the hopes that it would somehow redeem itself in the end (it didn't).  Each "character" in the book is an extreme caricature of a real person, snarkily drawn around whatever characteristic they might have that offends the author (ie is different from her beliefs about mothering).  This is especially ironic because her main complaint about many of these women is that they are not accepting of those who are different from themselves.  Yet, that is exactly how the author appears to the reader - as completely unwilling to look for the good in people who might not be exactly the same type of mother as she is.  All of the mothers in my moms club and playgroups share some of the traits the author scorns in this book, but none of them are such cartoonish people as the characters in her books.  And none of them are so quick to judge and find others lacking as are her denizens of Mommy Land (and as she appears to be herself, based on her scathing portrayals of the women in her book).  It's so sad to think of everyone being labeled, categorized, and marked off as unworthy of friendship or respect just because they happen to feel differently than you do about breastfeeding, Bugaboos, or bedtime crying.    As a side note, I was astonished to see so many typographical errors in such a short book.  Although the book is barely 1/4" thick and only took an hour to read, I lost count of all the errors and mistakes; it seems as if there was no editor or proofreader at all.    If you really want to give this book a chance, check it out from the library so you can put your money towards a higher quality title.  Hopefully that way you won't feel as cheated as I did!  
 ...and in the case of "Exterminator!" that's not a good thing.  Granted, this sloppy collection of short stories stitched together as a novel will appeal to fans of the author's fragmented, "Naked Lunch" style (run-on sentences, nonsensical incidents, etc.)... but will likely turn anyone else off.  The first hundred pages, especially, consist of some of the most alienated, distant, and boring prose I've ever read.  For the rest of the novel, however, there are poignant and poetic passages relating to politics, the Vietnam war, and racial and sexual discrimination, among other things, so "Exterminator!" isn't entirely worthless, but it's a far cry from Burroughs' best work 
 Office 2007 may seem ok at first.  The menus are all ok for me to use, so I don't have to build menus from scratch.  But after installing the trial, I found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if I had it.  1)  Word doesn't want to integrate with Outlook very well 2)  Everytime I want to send a mail message I accidentally click on 'Paste' 3)  The flags and categories for Outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than Outlook 2003 4)  Along with all of the other Microsoft products I've tried in the past month, it hangs, corrupts its own files, and generally takes up too much memory.  I'll stick with Office 2003, which doesn't have nearly as many flaws.  There is no reason for me to upgrade.  I'm also back to IE6, Money 2006, and will not upgrade to Vista.  I've lost volumes of emails because I can't downgrade my Outlook files.  Good Job in alienating your customers, Microsoft.  (so what's new? 
 This book does not provide any information that could not be found in a college level textbook. The assumptions and examples provided in the book are over simplified. If you are anything higher than a junior accountant I would suggest you purchase something else. Calling this book a "Controller's Guide" is just plain wrong 
 I think what's annoyed me the most is that Evie has gone from a talented, and exciting person to a major cow. All she seems to care about is herself and her own wants.  And this whole relationship with Daniel made no sense whatsoever.  Daniel as loyal husband just didn't work when one couldn't see the connection between them.  On her side, it all just seemed to be about possession.  On his, who knows?  the acting was weak there.  The rest of it was quite boring.  This series was not gripping like Series 1 and at least half of series 2 (that got annoying with Evie's selfishness again).  And the dialogue in general and the acting was getting more and more stilted and dull 
 The stars tell it all. The future is not happening for this book. But I don't want to be a shrew, so I'll just say, I don't like to be bored while reading and leave it at that 
 Dr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures.  However, I was appalled by her bias against Western cultural heritage and Christianity.  Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women.  As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns.  I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research.  
 The games faults have been well covered already so I'll just say, if a Roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for Ceasar IV. Afer playing the demo I can say that this will be a FAR superior game than civcity on every level. It seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably. 
 I missed the book club meeting that discussed this book but thought I would read the book anyway because everyone seems so enamoured with Ms. Cleage.  I read the first 150 pages of this book and I am bored to tears.   All of the reviews call this book astonishing; did the reviewers read the 1st 150 pages--nothing, absolutely NOTHING interesting happens in these pages.  Even if the author made up for it in the last 150 pages, this book could not be an astonishing book.  I will not be reading anymore Cleage books.  I, however, will try to finish reading this one since I started it.  My hopes for some excitement in the book,however, has been shattered by the other reviewers who state that the book doesn't even have excitement at the end of the book 
 At first glance the price sounds reasonable, but wait until you peel these things. Strip off the peel and there's another one. Peel that off and there's another one underneath. I removed the third one and, you guessed it, another one beneath that. Frustrated, I kept peeling and peeling and finally, right at the center, was this tiny little sliver. After peeling the whole bag I was left with only about an ounce of this pungent vegetable. Talk about a ripoff 
 Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.  I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.   The phrase that I found mose running through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was "o'erweening arrogance". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way.  I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.  I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my "critique" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that 
    This HGW novel is not as satisfying as his more famous  sci fi pieces, but it is representative of turn-of-the-century interest in galactic exploration.  Related in the first person by an impoverished would-be playwright, Mr. Bedford (for whom no first name is given), the story opens as he makes the acquaintance of an eccentric scientist named Cavor in a coastal area of England.  Gradually persuaded by the latter's dreams of conquering gravity by means of a substance he will eventually invent, Bedford soon becomes an enthusiastic convert to theoretical astronomy; he injects some practical ideas-as well as his private dreams of avarice and proprietary empire.  Ah, the temptation of creating one's little sphere of power.       Embarking on an odyssey in a sphere made of Cavorite the partners in adventure land in a crater on the moon, where they encounter odd vegetation which flourishes during the two-week lunar day.  But even more amazing is their discovery of a species of intelligent beings (described by Cavor as ant-men) who dwell in the moon's interior.  When captured the two men fight their way back to the surface, but become separated.  Assuming that Cavor has been killed by the native Selenites (Cavor;s term for them),  Bedford manages to return to Earth, but the story does not quite end there.  What is the source of mysterious transmissions from the moon and--equally curious--what causes them to cease?  Wells' protagonists express the author's commentary on man's propensity for warfare and injudicious zeal to modulate alien civilizations due to our anthropomorphic egocentrism.  Nevertheless, this book offers great sci fi lore which will appeal to kids of all ages!      
 Ok well this book SUCKED!!! It's all about baribie kara. I was actully at first thinking Kara wasn't that bad for a character but beacause of this book now I think shes not a good character anymore. This book made me got really dissapionted. I really like the series and I will still continue reading the series but if she is going to steal Emily's horn AGAIN then I might as well not read anymore books about Kara. 
      Sorry to say I found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying, something I haven't experienced with other removers.       In addition, it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish.          On the plus side, it's fragrance free and reasonable in price 
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 This is the French X-rated version of 99 women, directed by Jess Franco. The running time of this feature is 98 minutes, which means that this is probably the longest, least censored version of the film that is available. The story involves a women`s island prison, a sadistic female warden, a lustful male governor, and the young, lovely female inmates. Can you see where this is heading ? There ARE scenes of extreme sexuality (especially when you consider the film was released in 1969) which include (...). My big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film. In a few cases, they don`t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching. Also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling (standing-in)for. Just because a woman is wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the lead actress that she is portraying. I guess that this movie was pushing the boundaries in 1969, but looking at the dumb story, lousy editing, and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective.....this is just a dated curio 
 I assume that at some point this project had a much better script than the final one in order to get William Hurt and others involved. I'll hold that in my mind as the only way they would get into this mess. It has action and special effects enough for 4 movies, but the plot is all over the map and never congeals into anything special.With the talent and money  that they must have had this is one poor excuse of a movie 
 I had great expectations of this book but the more I read the worse it got. For a person who is supposed to be an 'Orientalist' he sure does hate his subject. Under cover of being a scholar Lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning. This ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the Middle East today. Powerful people listen to Lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the Muslim world. Unfortunately this advice comes from a person who has made it a lifelong mission to destroy and defame the very subject he claims to be an expert of 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 Unfortunately, and as usual, idiotic directors and editors have ruined a great show! Panning, zooming, cutting...God it's awful. I remember hearing that Bob was upset by it and apologized to the cast. The really sad thing is that the show, staged by Kathy Dobie, Bob's long time assistant, was beautifully recreated and then ruined by those fools filming it.. During the big "Sex Ballet", the shoot from behind with glaring lights so that you really have no sense of what the dance is. The sound it bad, the cutting is bad and Kat stinks. All that said, it will be your only chance to see what Broadway dancers used to look like. Get it for the history. By the way, if you want to see another show that was totally ruined by bad cutting, see Sunday in the Park with George. This beautiful show was destroyed by idiotic editors! 
 Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this 
 The book does give Hamiltons WSJ columns, which are of historical interest, but does not provide a useful method of applying the theory.  Much better material on the Dow Theory are available on the internet 
 While this Modern Library edition is attractively produced, all teachers and students who hope to use it in an academic setting should be aware that this is a severe abridgement--it represents about one-eighth of the original text from 1660-1669.  As a result, there are large gaps in continuity, exacerbated by a lack of editorial notes to fill in those gaps.  Also, the abridgement omits many of the sexiest passages and seems tailored to a Victorian sensibility.  .. 
 I don't get the politics of Tony Bennett saying "yes, dear" to KD Lang at the end of the 1st number, but sad to say, the whole album seems an overproduced mistake, including sappy saxophone interludes and treacly high-pitched violin countermelodies.  I love sax.  I mean, I love saxophones and saxophone players as if they were part of my family.  But someone has got to stop this easy listenin' moony-waily lushly lackadaisical sinuous syrupy "smooth jazz" exploitation of just one tiny, embarrassing aspect of the saxophone's otherwise terrific character.  But I doubt the small-minded no-talents who produced this album would ever get the drift.  Note to Word Lovers:  "Treacle" originally meant "a medicinal compound formerly in wide use as a remedy against poison."  However, Tony and KD got suckered into singing on an album that's practically poisonous itself 
 My review is two thumbs down.  It might help a total novice at the game, but it provides nothing for people who know anthing about poker 
 I loved the original book "The Sherbrooke Bride".  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead 
 After really enjoying the first 3 books in this series I began to find it to be rather formulaic.  And the characters have begun to be annoying rather than charming.  Amelia is self centered, Hannah is rigid, and Grace has no spine at all.  I found myself being irritated by them instead of curious 
 The author of this book was no historian, just a man with an idea. When he tried to find proof that Alexander was the bad guy, he could not. He then decided to come up with as much falsified and non-backed evidence that he  could.  I found this FAIRY-TALE quite comical because of all the  mis-directing lies.  It was almost as if Bill Clinton had written it 
 I was disappointed in this book.  The photos appear so dated that I actually double-checked the copyright date and was surprised to see that it is a fairly recent release.  What troubled me most was that it seemed  incohesive, with no theme or direction.  Saeks usually does an outstanding  job with her design books, but I'm sorry I purchased this one 
 The mystery was boring, the characters tedious, and continually having events re-examined from someone else's point of view was a yawn. Why has a mummy in silk underwear been brought to the Emerson family's attention? What is the connection with the mysterious American millionaire and his man-eating daughter? By the end, I didn't much care. The Peabody novels have been going downhill as the series progresses, and I think the essential reason is that the author loves her main characters, the Emerson family, too much. They are perfect by default, no matter how reprehensible or stupid their behaviour, because they are the main characters and her beloved creations - it is only others who can be at fault. Rarely does anything truly bad ever happen to them, and if it does it is because of their "virtue" and "nobility" 
 Barber's trenchant jargon updates slogans for class-warfare and utopian proletarian dictatorships. The rhetoric relies on emotion to bridge logical leaps, hides a distain for cause and effect relationships and sidesteps questions about human nature.  Instead, Barber carelessly brews a mix of hip buzzwords and mass marketing clich. If you read this tome, be prepared for endless repetition of 'the capitalist is dangerous, but united the people cannot be defeated':  Repeat the following 5 or 10 times and you have the book in a nutshell: "Jihad pursues a bloody politics of identity, McWorld a bloodless economics of profit. Belonging by default to McWorld, everyone is a consumer; seeking a repository for identity everyone belongs to some tribe. But no one is a citizen. Without citizens, how can there be ..." {fill in the blank with any utopian quality: justice, happiness, equality, etc.}  The central problem for 21st century Marxists is updating the logic of class struggle.  In the first half of the 19th century Marx taught a strict evolutionary progression from noble-savage to slavery, from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalism.  Within a few years, Marx predicted, capitalism would collapse and the unavoidable socialist utopia would emerge.  Of course, the collapse didn't happen and Marxist have been rationalizing ever since.  Lenin had to add the Imperialist phase.  21st century Marxist need to show imperialism mutating into  global consumerism.   Towards this end, Barbour argues: 1. Capitalists have shed their 'nationalist' identity, finding it easier to enslave the proletariat via media manipulation. 2. Media manipulation (global consumerism) seeks to replace indigenous cultural identities with slavish loyalty to global products.   3. 'Wild Capitalism' promoting global products causes criminal damage to indigenous communities, and threatens environmental catastrophe.  4. Protecting these indigenous communities (victims) will require violence (socialist revolution).  Hidden beneath this victim-oppressor dualism lies the traditional Marxist faith in central planning or 'government by intellectuals.' Democracy can be dismissed because the 'means of communication' are held by the multinational capitalist elite.  And, Marxist don't need an elections, as intellectuals they already know what is best for everyone else. Thus, Barber spends the second half of the book describing the failures of democracy. Barber asserts that "the epoch on whose threshold we stand -- post communist, postindustrial, post national, yet sectarian, fearful, and bigoted -- is likely also to be terminally post democratic."   Time has not been kind to Barber. His 1995 predictions of post-democratic cultures has failed to materialize.  The 90s were not a decade of American decline.  Despite his attempts to be hip and techno-savvy, he entirely misses the dot com craze and  blogosphere. Further, failed to address the rise of Islamofascism.  He calls commercialism all sham, but relies entirely upon its rhetoric.  Consider the cover photo, why is the girl wearing so much makeup behind a chador?  How is she getting the Pepsi through the chador to here lips? The book has nothing to do with Islam, it is just a marketing sham about marketing shams.  In the end, it sell 'Barber, the hip international intellectual' and little else 
 This book is a waste of good paper.  Falsehoods, innuendo, lies, ommissions  -- everything Posner gave you, Mallon recycled.  It is apparent he's almost totally unfamiliar with the Kennedy murder.  This book doesn't belong on anyone's bookshelf.  I'd rate this at about  minus-5 stars but that wasn't one of the choices 
 My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO.  I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it. 
 I purchased these headphones a couple of months ago even after reading the negative feedback.  I wish I would have listened.  The headphones really do automatically cut-off when the music stops or when the audio is at a low level such as a very quite scene in a movie.  There is also a constant low level hiss in the background.   I know it is tempting to buy these because of the cheap price, but it really is worth it to spend a little more money on a higher quality set of wireless headphones 
 I would really like to like this book. I really love French literature, and "Un Coeur Simple" is certainly a classic. But this story is simply terrible. It is boring, repetitive, and seemingly never-ending. There are aspects which are simply too strange, such as the symbolism of the parrot. Not a fun read 
  I purchase a lot of educational videos on photography and Photoshop, but this one was not at all what I expected.  It has little, if any, educational value.  Instead, the video shows photos taken by French photographers with commentary (in French).  Don't buy this as an educational video.  
 Prof. Gardner's book is disappointing. He tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in basic competencies but wants to put inquiry first. Also, his language is inflated, and lacking in philosopical specificity. For example, he believes in building up the inner world of "mental representations" [unexplained term] yet insists on "performances of understanding" [another unexplained term].   Also, he has respect for the individual learner and individual differences, yet he is concerned about the "position" or "situation" or social class dynamics in which the learning takes place. Thus, he fails to do justice either to the individual or to class, race, or gender.  The role of leadership in learning is wholly ignored; and responsibility is not explored.  In short, it is extremely difficult to pin down Prof. Gardner. It would be kind to say he is eclectic. I hope it's just not fuzzy thinking.  However, we can discern that he has a romantic obsession with beauty, truth, and goodness. Imagine -- the Holocaust is reduced to being an illustration of what goodness is or is not! His treatment of these ideas is superficial and banal. I don't like to be so judgmental, but his writing about them does not deserve a detailed analysis.  When attacking E.D. Hirsch whom he calls the main speaker for "cultural literacy," he sets up a straw man. He says that Hirsch's school of thought has an underlying belief in the Lockeian "tabula rasa." Yet, I find nothing in Hirsch's writings to indicate that he believes in a tabula rasa.   Further, is Prof. Gardner really less elitist than Hirsch as some have claimed? I have found that the Harvard elite spend their entire lives trying to achieve and learn everything, and be on top. Their lives are marked by ambition to the Nth degree; yet, he debunks time-honored and experience-honored content areas that traditionally have defined literacy at its best. Thus, I find a certain inherent dishonesty in Gardner's presentation.    Believe me, friends, I have taught students who have many ideals, Greek ideals and other ideals, but know very little, nor do they aspire to learn. If they have those ideals, and if they are facile and glib, will they be the leaders of tomorrow who are embraced by Prof. Gardner?  I find a tendency on Prof. Gardner's part to oversimplify certain issues like the Holocaust, and to overcomplicate certain others like the nature of intelligence.   The world is not waiting for the concept of intelligence to be re-written.  Am I oversimplifying when I think that there is something very awkward about saying that there is no fundamental difference in intelligence between Einstein and the custodian of my school? Is this awkwardness because I am an elitist putting down the custodian?  Is it because of lack of intelligence that I am still in the grip of a univocal definition of intelligence? I don't think so. Rather, we all know we are dependent on each other, and that everybody has some unique aptitudes or gifts they can express and be respected for, but trying to elevate this understanding to a higher level of truth or intellectual significance seems to me to be illegitimate.   Lastly, his writing style is a bit too fond of adjectives, and the book reads as a whole like It Takes A Village by Mrs. Clinton. The Disciplined Mind has a mellifluous style that presents itself as being highly sophisticated and, at the same time, as down-to-earth, with balanced common sense. Yet, ultimately, the book is boring.  As one Amazon reviewer states, Prof. Gardner is full of himself.    In this book, there is no straightforward discussion or emphasis placed on knowledge, justice, Judeo-Christian values, persistence, responsibility, or character development...words which I find essential for a true philosophy of education.  
 This album should get a 5/10. It's very mediocre. Despite being diverse, it really doesn't pull off any one style well. The rap lyrics are pretty bad. I really liked their latest record, so I decided to check this one out. You can tell that they were young when they cut this record and their songwrting skills were not truly honed yet. The early EP tracks at th end of the disc are horrible. As a whole, you may find something to like on here, but I recommend their other cds over this 
 I have disappointed with the performance of this toaster.  After weeks of research I purchased this to replace my 8 year old Cuisinart which had been discontinued.  Six months later I have yet to get an evenly toasted piece of bread and have to continually adjust the settings.  Unfortunately since I purchased it through Amazon's merchant online, I can't return it.  Wish I'd gone with the Braun.  
 Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese.  This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert.  I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction.  Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly.  When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point?  The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory.  And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense.  One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch.  
   This particular edition of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" is a bare literal translation prefaced by a rather wordy introduction that pads the book up to a total of 96 pages.  While the translation is not bad, the book contains no explanations or notes to enlighten the readers on some of the more obscure points, such as the modern equivalents of ancient Chinese distance measures.   The one sentence review, pronouncing this to be the best translation, was perhaps a bit generous.  Among both military and history buffs, the prevailing view is that the translation by Lionel Giles, of the British Museum, is the definitive translation.  Of the various available editions of the Giles translation, the Special Edition that contains two complete copies of the English text - one with and one without extensive notes and commentary - in addition to the complete text in Chinese characters - is far and away the best.  The $4.95 price for this book (or for the matchbox size miniature edition from Running Press) is a bargain only for those who are more concerned with price than with value.  Choosing a better edition of "The Art of War", rather than this rather skimpy edition, will be money well spent.  It is far better to own a book you can be proud of and which does a better job of informing you than this merely passable edition.  
 Porter and Teisdale have clearly never spent any time actually managing a healthcare service operation; if they did they would have never written this book.  While the concept of adding value to the lives of patients is critical to the success of the next iteration of the American medical system, their attempts to define the path to building value are delightful constructs that will only tie up the minds and methods of genuine healthcare professionals who are desperate for any logic -- and books like this only serve to delay the actual evolution of the human services professions.  Please be careful when you read this -- it has no grounding in realityt and 5-7 years from now will be as useful as sanitariums for tuberculosis 
 "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting.  Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet.  In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old.  Why is this interesting??  Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile 
 This book was required reading for my advanced placement english class. I consider myself a lover of the written word. I dream of someday becoming a novelist, or at least an english teacher. It usually takes me 3-5 days to finish a book, especially a good book. It has taken me 2 months to read this book. It is not only boring, but often times repetetive. Barbara Kingsolver relates everything to September 11th. Granted, this was a tragic day for our country and should always be remembered. But I dont see why Ms. Kingsolver found it necessary to write a whole novel about it. I find even less necessary for this to be required reading. Every once in a while Ms. Kingsolver finds the need to express herself with words that are a little more complicated than need be. It was a less than pleasent read and I wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy 
 The problem with this book is that the author completely overlooks the culpability of the U.S. in the acts of genocide discussed.  The U.S.bombing of Cambodia although not in itself an act of genocide was the reason why peasants flocked to the Khmer Rouge who previously were a marginal group.  It was the U.S. who blocked any attempts of the UN to send more soldiers to Rawanda.  As well, it was the U.S. that armed Indonesia so that they could attack and occupy East Timor, a clear case of Genocide.  etc. etc. etc 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 Its been  a while since I seen a crapfest such as this. From the start it was clear that I was going to despise the flick, although the full frontal nudity in the beginning was'nt half-bad. WHy anyone, especially a female, would want to skinny dip alone in a old secluded lake is beyond me, but we get  alot of that here. In fact,ther's one sequence where a group of seven girls, just finish a basketball gameand decide to get fully naked and take a dip in the lake. Although this was supposedly set in the 50s it was clearly made in the 80s, and I guess bathing suits weren't a necessity back then. The story revolves around a town that's plagued by rumors of missing people around the 'lake of the damned' a name dubbed after a number of German soldiers were massacred and thrown into the lake.The story behind the lake goes back to the timesof the inquisition where the lake was once thought to be a place of sacrafice to please the gods, and without one, they will rise from the depths of the lkae wrecking all sorts of havoc. This leads to our dead Nazi rising from the lake and doing harm to anyone who decides to trespass; apparently they weren't properly sacraficed. There a 20 minute sequence explaining everything, or more specifically, showing us what happened since there's little to no dialogue throughout the entire sequence. In fact, there are many scenes in the movie that have no dialogue, which probably would'nt have done the movie much good anyway, especially with its incredibly slow pacing. There are even some scenes that last entirely too long, while others are just poinless. Whether it was intentional or not,there a funny scene involving a zombie returning home to greet his daughter(who wasn't born when he died),giving viewers what we want while watching a zombie film -- faimly bonding and much needed dramatic pauses. Speaking of dumb zombies, the basic make-up is green -- yes there are no huge gashes, or clearly rotted flesh, but instead we have zombies that are just a little too moldy . On the plus side, there is a decent part in the film where the zombies decide to run amok in the town, although you wouldn't know it since it was way too damn dark to see what was going on, which was another continuing occurrence thoughout the film. You hardly guess this was a zombie movie since there was zero gore. Thats 90 minutes of my life I will not get back. I've seen some pretty bad zombie flicks in my years and this is another one to add to that list.The only thing that made it watchable was all the excessive nudity, but even then it was barely worth anyone's time. Avoid at all cost! 
 Don't believe the hype.  This book is not a masterpiece, but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don't quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you'll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in Justine.  It took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book.  The narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture.  But what kept me going were Durrell's secondary characters.  He has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in Justine are striking, emotional, and entertaining.  I am glad that I was able to make it to the end of the novel (there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while), but I do regret that I recommended this novel to my bookgroup and I do not plan to complete the quartet 
 Overall my experience with this mouse pad is very disappointing. I had this mouse pad for more than a month and my experience with it is average to very poor. The only positive is it is a very sturdy mouse pad. I have used an optical mouse and a laser mouse on this mouse pad. Both were manufactured by Microsoft. The optical mouse works ok on this mouse pad but the laser mouse (micro) does not work at all. Although I have not tested mice from other manufacturers, I believe this is something new buyers should be aware of before they spend any money on this good looking mouse pad. 
 The magazine does have good information, but not for a child...it's more geared to an adult.  Watch out though!  They like to send you notices of collection if you do not renew the magazine when your subscription is up 
 Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks. It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I'm not so sure it would keep someone who write's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing. Side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn't been a problem. The service was excellent from Belt Outlet. Arrived in a normal amount of time.. Very courteous when I called and explained why I would be returning 
 This drive may be excellent.  I'll never know.  I have now gone through two of them.  The first one let out a loud pop and started smoking after being connected to power.  It was plugged into a power strip that has no problems with any other equipment.  Thank goodness it didn't take my iMac down with it.  Just received the replacement today.  It powered up for about ten seconds before turning off never to spin up again.  At least there was no explosion this time.  At this point, I'm done with this drive.  I'll be looking into another brand 
 Beliavsky et al.'s book is one of the worst chess books I have ever seen.  The book is so poorly laid out that it is difficult to follow the various variations and subvariations.  Otherwise, it is bascially a dump of games and lines that have intrigued the authors, omitting many other lines, and possibilities.  Don't expect to find scintilating commentary either because all the notes are in Informator-speak hieroglyphics.  I have studied chess for over ten years and own over 50 chess books.  This book is one of the worst.  Just run a search on the Two Knights in ChessBase and save your money for a nice dinner or trip to the movies 
 After reading both this book and the 70-297 Sybex book, there is no comparison.  This book does not cover anything that you don't already know if you are on the MCSE track.  It seemed to be more written for someone that is just taking this exam... and hasn't studied anything for the other 6 exams in the MCSE track.  My advice, spend the extra $ and get the Sybex book by Brad Price... it will be money well spent, and you may actually learn something you don't already know... I know I did 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Antidotal stories, personal opinions, and somewhat painful to listen too.  It was a great premise, but the delivery isn't very good.  I wish I had saved my money and not purchased this boo 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused.  I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain.  If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe 
 Sorry every one but I think this movie was so dumb. Jamie kennedy plays a slim shady moron who thinks he's black and calls himself B-rad which I think is so pathetic and even offensive to try and act black which he's really not. So I don't believe that B-rad is a true bad a** gangster rapper I think he's a huge moron who can't act his own age and race. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because of that one scene at the club where B-rad trys to do his own rap battle attack (which he really sucks at) against the real tough rappers who they all despised B-rad. That was the most funniest scene in this movie that cracked me up til I cried. 
 lsd is not as popular these days,and you'd need it to stomach this recording..this is awful.buy rennaisance,the first album,and the new album "the return" to hear vintage bogert and appice jam 
 In our opinion this book is a poor excuse for scholarship. The seminal work by Harry Oldmeadow on this same subject shows what a scholarly work should be - thorough, balanced and properly sourced. Interesting that Oldmeadow isn't listed in the Index.   This book appears to rely on hearsay and an incorrect understanding of Traditionlism to concoct a sensationlist work that is a marketer's dream but a true scholar's nightmare. 
 I am very disappointed in this book. There is almost no information on setting up and adjusting a steel string acoustic guitar. I don't know much but I already know a lot more about it than what is in this book 
 during startup, it asks if you have audio. as i don't like talking apps, i click "no" - no audio. it starts blabbing. kill the audio on the computer.  the lack of flexibility is irritating but it doesn't take much to convert a pdf into some other format.  contrary to some reviews, it worked okay on osx.  i won't be buying any other orman products, thanks .. 
 I expected this book to be about the freshman year experience, based on the title and the way that the book began.  However, the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life.  The author did not live in a freshman residence hall and I am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not.  Memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college (cut corners) as a stragegy to manage their time 
 Well, there're always the bands that evolve and change their styles. You may or may not like them, or like their style at the beginning but not later phases, and vice-versa. But this album is completely different than every other Oasis album. It has a completely different sound (I'm not saying it's bad - not my taste to be honest - but some people might like it). If you're looking for "Oasis Sound" albuns, you're looking in the wrong place. The sound here is noisy, you can see it was not worked on.  In my opinion, Oasis felt too big for their own good, and thought people would like and buy anything they did - so "why bother with the lyrics, clear sound and instrumentality that got us here?" Well, at least it's the feeling I got.  I'm a huge Oasis fan from day 1. My true, honest opinion is: you can buy absolutely ANY of their other albums and get GREAT Oasis music. In this album, you'll find something else, a sound that's not theirs. I have it, and would trade it for any of the two I don't yet have, Heathen Chemistry and Don't Believe the Truth. Totally dispensible from an Oasis collection. Bad music? Well, we each have our own tastes, so who am I to judge? If you're curious, listen to it and judge yourself! ;) But in Oasis' on words: "We'll never release s*** again! 
 This is a good book with lots of great information about the incestuous relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family.  The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.     Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book.  Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney?  Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.  Why then did he resort to a bigot like Michael Moore for an endorsement 
 I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:  1.  When the program works, it's superb.  2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.  For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.  Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.  My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle 
 I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it 
 I teach third graders who read at a 5th-9th grade level. The first problem with this book is that, on the back, in huge, yellow letters, is, "Learn more about your Christain heros!  Read what traditional  educators try to keep from you!"  Not a good thing to send home. 	  This book was much too difficult for them, not just because of the  unnecessarily thick language. It is very poorly written.  The prose is  wordy and full of characters who are only mentioned once and then  forgotten.  The children claimed to like and understand this book, but  their retention and actual understanding was nil 
 Having been famous all over eastern Europe for its beauty and splendor, the amber room's unsolved disappearance in 1945 caused a true flood of unbridled speculations. The mystery proved itself extremely fertile for all sorts of fantasy-stories, mystery-novels, faked history reviews and other nonsense.  What is known & proven: after having been conquered by Adolf Hitler's soldiers in 1941, the room was transported from its palace outside Leningrad (= nowadays' St.-Petersburg) to the German city of Konigsberg (= nowadays' Russian Kaliningrad). On its way some of its items were stolen by German soldiers. Having arrived at Konigsberg, the room was exhibited in the local castle. In the second half of worldwar 2, when the danger of Allied bombing steadily increased, the amber room was stored for safety in the castle's cellars.   From this point knowledge stops and speculation sets in. In August 1944 Konigsberg was bombed twice. Its castle, right in the city centre, was hit and burned out completely. In April 1945 Konigsberg was captured by the Soviet army in savage streetfighting. In other words, from the moment of its storage opportunities for destruction had been plenty. The more so, while amber burns very well from itself.  Destruction of works of art surely was quite common in those terrible days in eastern Europe. Many of them vanished without trace. The difference with the amber room is only made by the latter's huge reputation, promptly turning its unrecorded disappearance into a legend.  I think it makes more sense to turn to the reality of our days. Sponsored by 'Ruhrgas AG', a German firm dealing in Russian gas, the amber room has been rebuilt with great Russian craftsmanship. In May 2003 Russian president Putin and German chancellor Schroder officially re-opened it.   The truly magnificent replica has been enrichened by one of its authentic panels. Presenting us with an Italian landscape made from colored stone, this panel was one of the items stolen in 1941. After having decorated an ordinary German living room for many years, it was traced by the police and returned to the Russians.  Purchasing a book or DVD on the replica surely is worth your money. You'll find them on many a German site. It makes more sense than losing yourself in all sorts of idle speculation.    
 Rape, incest, broken marriages, endless bitterness, rage, sorrow, and self-destruction. As I write this, I realize I am flying in the faces of all the serious reviewers who have weighed in about the historical importance of this work, of its reflection of a post-apartheid era where the wounds of the past take their awful toll on every aspect of living for both blacks and whites in South Africa today. Nonetheless, I found this work to be unbearable, stifling, suffocating, and terribly written. Its self-conscious literary style was embarrassing. Its pace makes a snail look like a racehorse. Its endless redundancy drove me nuts!! Its minute observations about the three main characters, Lydia, Silas, and Mikey, made me hate them. Its self-important deadly seriousness made me want to die. Its structure is that of (1) memories of brutalities and divisions, (2) confessions of crimes committed, and (3) bloody vengeance taken. Not a pretty story. Not a pretty book. Its title is perfect. Be prepared, gentle reader, to drink from a large cup of bitterness, if that's where you want to go. I personally found it impossible to feel the full weight of the bitterness this author has to offer here because I have not lived his life, nor have all the reviewers who have "enjoyed" this work. If I had it to do over again, I would not have suffered through this book. It was torture. But perhaps that was the author's point, to project the torture these characters have lived through. Even so, bad writing.   
 This completely lacks the charm and subtlety of the original.  Overblown, overproduced Mackintosh garbage. If he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage, I'm sure he wouldn't have hesitated.  Mr. Banks has been turned into a one dimensional clown and his songs have all been changed for the worst. And the omission of "Sister Suffragettes" smacks of PC nonsense 
 I HAVE BEEN SOMERSIZING FOR ABOUT 5 WEEKS AND HAVE ENJOYED THE FOOD RECIPES IN SUZANNE SOMERS 3 BOOKS, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS DESSERT BOOK.  SO FAR I HAVE LOST 10 LBS AND AM LOVING THE RESULTS WITHOUT STARVING MYSELF.  HER PROGRAM IS TRUELY A WAY TO LIVE BY.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PURCHASE HER PRODUCTS, BECAUSE SHE GIVES YOU MOST OF THE RECIPES IN HER BOOKS, I LIKE THAT!  THIS DESSERT BOOK DID FALL SHORT THOUGH COMPARED TO THE OTHER WONDERFUL BOOKS.  I HAVE TRIED THE CHEESECAKE WHICH IS OK, BUT WHEN YOUR EARLY ON HAVING THE SUGAR CRAVINGS IT LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED, I SUFFERD THROUGH.  WE ALSO TRIED THE ICE CREAM AND THE PREVIOUS REVIEW IS EXACTLY RIGHT, THE SOMERSWEET MAKES THE ICE CREAM HARD AS A ROCK, IT WASNT VERY GOOD.  I HAVE YET TO TRY ANY OTHER RECIPES.  THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK MORE LIKE THE DESSERTS I AM USED TO ARE ON LEVEL 2, SO I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH.  I HAVE MADE A GOOD MOUSSE DESSERT USING SUGAR FREE CHOC PUDDING AND CREAM, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE AN ALMOST LEVEL ONE.  I PERSONALLY WOULDNT WASTE THE $ ON THIS BOOK. 
 The present-day Pentagon budget, adjusted for inflation, is projected to be 23% over the average of the Cold War era.  By some calculations, the U.s. spends more than all other nations on defense, maintaining forces in several dozen countries (perhaps over 100).  Among current members of Congress, the percent of veterans is now lower than anytime since the end of WWII.  Bacevich goes on to assert that we have married a militaristic mindset in the 1990s with utopian ends, that this has been reaffirmed by 9/11 and the Global War on Terror, and that this does not serve our interests.  Probably true.  However, the vast bulk of "The New American Militarism" consists of Bacevich rambling about Weinberger, Powell, Abrams, etc., with little compelling documentation, quantification of impact, or common thread.  Bottom Line:  Boring 
 the tone for the shows music was created by wendy melvoin & lisa coleman...the theme they created is the best part of this cd. too bad more of the original music from the first season wasn't included in this compilation. also, just a correction to a previous post; the people who designed the main titles won the emmy, the jeff beal 
 I am very disappointed with this product.Its does not look like anything in the picture displayed.Its not worth your money. 
 The very first chapter talks about folks starting to invest in real estate.  Of course they bought all their investment properties  using other peoples money (mortgages), which is fine. The only question for Mr. Kiyosaki: Which bank is giving a conventional mortgage for the investment property at 95 % LTV, meaning putting only 5% down? As far as I know 5% downpayment  or less is available for PRIMARY residence ONLY. You can not have 2 primary residencies. The Bank can see in your credit report how many mortgages you have. When applying for the new mortgage bank requires to explain all other mortgages in the credit report. You definetely can not buy all 5 properties -  with 5 % down. It is very inaccurate and misleading. Minimum downpayment for the investment property is 20%, not every bank will do it, a lot of them will ask for 25-30% downpayment for investment properties. Go to your local bank and check it out. So Mr. Kiyosaki is not telling the truth? Are those stories REAL? Seems like he is getting rich on writing very controversial books using the success of the first couple of them but not really investing in real estate. 
 "If a nut on the wall is a walnut, what is a nut in the bathroom?  A pee can."  "Why did the baby cross the road?  She was stapled to the chicken."  Billing itself as "the mother of all joke books", The Jokelopedia has the apparent goal of turning your child (or grandchild, etc.) into a comedian.  Categorized by subject matter such as a monster jokes, classroom distractions, family funnies, etc., the book contains riddles, jokes, cartoons, and tips from famous comedians.  Many of the riddles have pun-ch lines consisting of puns:  some that I consider funny, and many of which adults will consider groaners, but will get a lot of giggles from 8 year-olds.    Although I tend to like puns more than the average person, as a practitioner of non-violent communication, I don't recommend giving this book to children.  I am concerned that roughly up to 10 to 20% of the laughs come at the expense of becoming desensitized to the suffering of animals and humans.  For example, there's a joke about a woman who buys a parrot, and to get the bird to talk, she buys a mirror, a ladder, a bell, etc.  She goes back to the store and reports that the parrot died.  The clerk expresses his sorrow over her loss and asks if the parrot ever said anything to her.  The woman replied that just prior to dying, the parrot said, "Doesn't that store carry any food?"  So the joke is that the parrot starved to death because the woman was too stupid to buy food in addition to all the accessories.  There are riddles that have punch lines at the expense of animal suffering, for example, "What's black and white and flat? A panda that's been run over."  And the tacky frog in a blender joke, mentioned by a previous reviewer, could give a child the idea to actually try this (likely very few children but it's possible).  Although much of the egregiously tacky material is in the "Snot funny" section, there is some in other sections of the book.  Another reason I don't recommend the Jokelopedia is because of the practical joke recommendations.  The child who tries out these suggestions will probably think he or she is being funny, but those laughs come at the expense of being rude and crude to other people, and insensitive to their feelings.  For example, one of their slumber-party jokes is to pour cold water over the shower curtain rod on someone using the shower.  Another is to put another child's hand in a glass of warm water to get him or her to wet the bed.  Yet another is to put some fake plastic vomit in the sink.  One of the elevator practical jokes is to bet the other passengers that you can fit a quarter in your nose.  Yuck.  Another joke encourages lying:  "Tell [your big sister] that one of her friends called (for this to work, be specific--use the real name of someone your sibling is close to and say one of the coolest kids in school is having a party tonight, but you can't remember all the details."  In case your budding comedian runs out of practical ideas to play on siblings and parents (yes, a parental practical joke idea involving the kitchen sink sprayer is provided--don't say you weren't warned!), there are five suggestions for tormenting the pizza guy.  One could, as another reviewer did, rip out some of the pages prior to giving the book to a child, or perhaps cross out portions with a thick dark marker like it's a government document.  (But if you rip out the page of slumber party practical jokes, the blurb on Lucille Ball is on the other side.)   Had I received this book as a child with pages ripped out, I would have been extremely curious about what was missing and sought out another copy!  Unless the authors write a new edition that takes out the practical and insensitive to suffering jokes, I don't recommend rewarding them by purchasing this book.  That's unfortunate, because I think some of the puns are very clever, and encourage children to have fun with the language. 
 If you like to take pictures with macro lense, it sucks. I've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality. If you get closer than five inches, the pictures messes up. I've had no other problem with the hardware, though I hate carrying around that dock and it's odd shaped charger. No other charger cable in the world is going to fit! So loose it and you're screwed. oh, and night photos also suck. BIG TIME, even with the flash on 
 I got this book for my son when we got to the point that he had so many questions (technical in nature) that I couldn't remember the exact answer to (or don't know, not being a boy). I turned to my male friends for help, and one recommended "The Guy Book," which he had given to his  5 boys and they liked a lot. My son loved  it. It has a lot of info on boys, their bodies, their issues with friends,  and such necessary details as how to buy a corsage and tie a tie. My son asked intelligent questions, sparked by the book, and has read bits of it over and over.  The book is laid out in a non-threatening way, with fun illustrations and enough silly entries that it draws the reader in so that when they get to potentially embarassing material they just keep on going. It's also divided up so that, like the car repair manual it emulates, you can dip in to the one specific piece of info you need and then put it down until later.  Because of his interest, I've given this book to my nephews and recommended it to friends with pre-teens. Some of my nieces found it really useful, too, because it explains a lot about how and why boys do certain things.   I recommend this especially to parents who have trouble talking to their kids beyond a certain age, or single moms who, like me, just don't know the right answer. (If you don't know the answers, I recommend you read it. Then you'll know what you need to know to answer the next set of questions.)  The only thing wrong with this book is that I didn't write it. ;- 
 You have got to be kidding me. This stuff was tacky when it ran in magazines...  so now a book of it? Whatev... not to mention the horribly CHEAPO paper and way crummy binding. What was the guy thinking? Filthy lucre, I suppose. Three to six months until it hits the remainder table. A better subtitle might have been, "How I Stopped Worrying About What a Decent Book Should Be". Save  yourself the bread 
 I can't believe how complimentary the reviews on here are for these poems. Ugh. When I read them, I want to tear every last hair out of my skull. 
 Well i dint like the smell at all, i see nothing lovely about this perfum, if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season, check out Fantasy by Britney Spears it smells so nice, or Curious by Britney thats a classic its a must give or have, J.Lo's Live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present,or for urself its not really worth ur money! 
 Sedgwick reduces every piece of Literature to a ridiculous and illogical conclusion. She'd probably say this review was a "masturbatory fanasty brought on by delusions of supremacy." Sedgwick has some nuggets of  insight but they are buried in horrendous prose and thought 
 Lahaye once again showed his weak eschatology and also shows he rehashes the poor "research" done by other bible "teachers".  While I know the pre tribulation rapture is proved in the bible, very few pre-tribulation "teachers" have studied for themselves and do not see what is clearly taught in the bible.  Instead of doing their own research, they rehash and regurgitate the poorly researched articles and books written by extremely poor researchers.  Lahaye is guilty of rehashing poor research taught by other "teachers".  Lahaye is also guilty of changing what the bible clearly teaches and has deceived millions.  One example of his false teaching is that someone can take the mark of the beast and still be saved and go to heaven.  This DOWNRIGHT LIE has deceived people into thinking that 'taking the mark' is 'no big deal'.  All his books show the tribulation is "no big deal" and people can go on living fairly normally while judgements are happening (seems he doesn't think antichrist will turn off cell phones, electricity, or internet if they refuse his mark)  I will restate that the bible clearly teaches a pretribulation rapture - only none of the 'POPULAR' bible "teachers" do their own research so they never publish the clear teachings of a pre tribulation rapture.  Lahaye has done more to deceive the world than most people do - and he will be rewarded severely for his works.  Remember - Jesus said if the world loves someone, they are not His - because the world will hate those that are His as they hate Him.  Popularity of ANY bible "teacher" should be suspect because of what Jesus said.  Lahaye is a false teacher teaching deception that closely mimics the truth (just enough to be believed by most 
 First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan.  I love the majority of his work. Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book. I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book.  What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises.  None.  Not like "Of Mice And Men" or "East Of Eden" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck.  Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book.  If you've read his bio you must read "Grapes Of Wrath" to understand why Californians hated him so much.  In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book.  One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved "Grapes Of Wrath".  Go figure 
 If I was Steve Miller, i would have been appalled with the way the record company edited down all of these great tracks. What the heck were you thinking Capitol? Every song is edited even the classics like "the joker" and "jet airliner". The best part of "jet airliner" is the awesome opening guiitar solo, well thanks to Capitol Records they edited most of it out.It sounds terrible. Don't waste your money on this highly edited album. If you want Steve Miller Band's greatest hits, I suggest you get Steve Miller Band "young Hearts"-the complete Greatest hits. Yes It might cost you a few bucks more BUT you get the full length versions of all songs and it is digitally remastered in stere 
 This is one of those films that makes me think it must be impossible for anyone to make a truly great film.  The back cover makes it sound like a must-see for anyone going through a tough time in their lives and wanting a shoulder to lean on, and it seems all the critics concur that that's not an inacurate description, yet when I tried watching this film, I couldn't stand it!  The whole thing was a jumbled mess.  It kept going back and forth between things that I just didn't care about, tedious, boring things, and I think it focused too much on the criminals involved in the story, making them sound sympathetic or whatever, when the film was about a cop who was overcome by grief (supposedly, or something like that) at the death of his partner who was VICIOUSLY KILLED by a criminal.  A story like this shouldn't spend petty time detailing the exploits, trials and tribulations and whatnot of why the vicious killer kills people and does whatever else and all whatever...and when the writer wasn't focusing on the goodfornothing criminals, it focused on a bunch of pathetic backstory, the kind that makes teenagers cringe at the thought of reading a book (too much "character development").  And then I saw a truly breathtaking film, titled BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and was blown away by its depiction of heartbreak combined with stunning visuals, and everyone else is like "oh, who cares?"  I truly hate this film and I hate the society that lets people make such mediocre crap and then acts like its THEIR civil duty to put up with it (as in watch it) and then say they liked it.  And no, not all my favorite films are action/pop-corn flix.  I also liked 1999's BRINGING OUT THE DEAD, as well as 1976's TAXI DRIVER, and I even enjoy the occasional "little movie" (there's too many to mention, but I'll start with the last one I saw that I enjoyed: THE WILD DOGS, by the director of THE HANGING GARDEN - another film I hated).  Ok, that's all I have to say about this film 
 We were greatly disappointed in this travel guide since the information was out-of-date.  We spent a great deal of time locating a highly rated and recommended restaurant only to find that it had closed years ago.  Other recommended restaurants also did not meet the expectations according to the review criteria.  We tossed the book aside and relied on recommendations of the locals 
 The author fancies himself a Copernicus, by, similarly to the reversal of the notion that the sun revolves around the earth, rendering the notion of consciousness an "illusion" (last word, p.178). His ego is indeed enormous, my knowing of no other author quoting (p.45) and incessantly citing his own writing.  The notion of the sun revolving is an inference, from observing its change of position relative to the earth, and motion indeed is considered relative. But consciousness is not an inference. It is the most immediate phenomenon by which everything we know, or imagine, is manifested. Dennett persistently investigates distinctions in our brains, from dispositions to memories, often couching them in esoteric or otherwise unfamiliar terms, while sidestepping the simple fact that whatever the detailed particulars, all is presented to us through the medium of consciousness.  He puts great emphasis on the third-person approach, like questioning a subject about his perceptions, so as to discover misunderstandings about the inner workings of the mind, forgetting that all of these, whether actual perceptions or beliefs or else, are ingredients of consciousness. This his "scientific method", compared to first-person introspection, is the only approved one.  It is shared by others. Like Patricia Churchland, he has contempt for "folk" psychology, pitting it against favored "academic" (p.35). They also share a derogatory attitude toward dissenters, regarding them as reactionaries (p.8) or naysayers. The views are admittedly materialist, holding Cartesian dualism of mind and body "bankrupt" or a "disaster", as does John Searle.  Why? Descartes is not in line with their assumed all-inclusive scientific method, embraced also by philosophers, who traditionally delved deeper into issues of knowledge. I do so newly in my book and here wish to note that however physical inquiry progresses, consciousness, via which the inquiry is made, remains a distinct phenomenon. 
 Prey is to a novel what the "wild swarm" Ricky was to the real Ricky: It presents a suggestion of a real book, but lacks the features, the characteristics of the real thing ... and it disperses on the ground at the slightest breeze.   Like the worst of the bodice-ripper genre, Prey's hero, Jack, makes the stupidest decisions - or makes no decision at all - when presented with behaviors that would alarm anyone else ... all to make the plot move forward where Crichton wants it to go.   And when the communication lines were ripped out by the nano-Ricky and nano-Julia, I kept wondering whatever happened to Jack's cell phone? You know, the one he'd just used the day before to talk to his kids, and that worked just fine out in the desert?   Nevertheless, I kept reading to the end because Crichton's discussion about programming based on the natural world was fascinating. For that it gets a 2 rather than a 1.     
 Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time, by David Goodwillie is one of those books that at times fascinates the reader with insight, pace and plot.  At other times one wonders why the author and his editors included often tedious and disjointed chapters that far from enhance this memoir of New York.  As a native New Yorker, and one who lived there before and during the author's coming-of-age in the Big City novel, I usually am biased and get a kick out of these types of reads.  New York is like no other place - that is clearly true.  But one cannot help but sense that Goodwillie was reaching for a McInerney-type of novel, or perhaps even a shorter Tom Wolfe's style of New Journalism.  Sadly, Goodwillie, who at times in this book is clearly brilliant, falls short.  When writing in a more reflective and less journalistic manner is when the author is at his best.  And there was plenty of that.  Unfortunately, just when he grabbed my attention with his own style, his editor seemingly either allowed, or even encouraged, some unrelated drivel to waste several pages, if not chapters.  If he had cut out about 50 to 75 pages and focused more on the personal and societal implications of an individual trying to cut it in New York in the Age of the Internet (and its conflict with his desires as a writer) this book could have been very good.  It was not.  
 I am a big fan of Yo-yo Ma, but this CD is a tearjerker and afterwhile, I have to switch it off because it was so boring. I have all his other CD's and I wish it wasnt so... I highly recommend his baroque CD's though.  
 I write from the perspective of a life-long fan. This was one of the first modern bands that I loved and I followed their every release from my preteen years onward. They seemed to never miss the mark creatively or sonically, and the increasingly strong imagination and coherence behind each record was only matched by the increasingly complex production. But on this release, they seem to have run out of ideas and melodies and passion. That hurts to say, but it is painfully true. I'll accept this as their auto-pilot record. The reason I give it two stars is because it makes me appreciate Yoshimi, an album I initially viewed as a disappointment in the shadow of the Soft Bulletin, as a proper album (albiet a lateral move) 
 In installed this product on a Dell Optiplex GX110 (admittedly not the latest, but still a very standard machine) running Windows 2000 with 512MB of memory. In spite of spending literally hours with the software I was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse, as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video. Without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls. Multiple emails to Broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that I refer to their Website for help. This site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems (like not being able to read the install CD).  It would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver. Be prepared for possible frustrations with this product, with little support from the manufacturer. I cannot report on other features of the software because I was never able to produce even the walls of a structure 
 I bought this book looking for a good passage-based practice for the biology section of the MCAT. From my experience with the book 101 passages in Verbal Reasoning, I was impressed with Examkracker's accurate represenation of real MCAT questions. However, I soon found numerous errors in the questions used in this book, and I confirmed that they were wrong with several physiology and biology professors. From that point, I gave up on the book, because it caused more harm than good 
 Um, guys?  Isn't this the guy who testified with David Kay to Congress about "Saddam's nuclear program?"  So, um, now we know there was no program, right?  Which the CIA knew years ago, when Saddam's son-in-law defected.  So this book is, what exactly?  And how stupid are the reviewers below?  "Reads like a spy novel" indeed.  Apparently, this guy is still on the taxpayer's payroll, in charge of "re-educating" Iraqi scientists 
 Most of the information is very "theoritical" and "limited" -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her.  ...  In a nutshell, the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter(s), and in turn, the daughter(s) may pass that onto her offspring(s).  ...   
 Well, the Young Gunz basically suck.  Their lyrics are very weak and wack and the choruses they come with are extremely lame.  They also have very generic voices and flows which make for a boring listen.  The production as a whole is decent at best.  However, this album is 100 times better than the atrocity that is Memphis Bleek - 534.  But it's still not good. JayZ needs to clean the rap house and get rid of these 'guys' that call themselves rappers.  He should keep Kayne, Sigel, and Freeway and then cut the deck and start recruiting.  Young Gunz & Memphis Weak just don't have what it takes to carry simple songs let alone the entire Roc for years to come.  Please JayZ for the sake of the Roc's good name...get rid of these tag along bums bringing it down.  1 star 
 One has to know and understand the original German text of the Dreigroschenoper to be really able to judge the quality of the English translations. This one, used among others by Helen Schneider on her album  with Weill songs, has nothing of the sarcasms of the German lyrics. Better  read the 1954 translation of Marc Blitzstein or the translation made by  Frank McGuinness in the early 1990s 
 I picked up this short-story collection because the cover said it was a collection of vampire erotica and because the book was edited by Poppy Z. Brite.  I feel like I've been ripped off.  First of all, to say that this book is a collection of vampire erotica is misleading.  Aside from some rough language here and there, there is almost no erotica in this collection.  This is a collection of horror stories, period.  And the stories are quite dull at that.  The only ones I liked were "In this Soul of a Woman," by Charles de Lint; "The Alchemy of the Throat," by Brian Hodge; and "Café Endless: Spring Rain," by Nancy Holder.  The aforementioned stories are thought provoking and horrific at the same time.  The other stories simply failed to spark my interest.  Poppy Z. Brite has let me down.  I have the second part of the collection and am considering returning it to the bookstore.  If you are in the bargain for vampire erotica, try the Ellora's Cave books 
 I was attracted to this novel after reading a non-fiction article on stem cell research written by the author that was anthologized in Best American Science and Nature Writing. McManus' daughter has had diabetes since childhood, and when I discovered that he had written a novel about a 29-year-old woman with diabetes who takes a cross-country bike trip to lay her personal demons I hoped for a tale of overcoming great obstacles. I was taken with the character and kept reading to hear more about her even as the unlikely events piled one on top of the other. I gave the author a LOT of slack hoping for a thoughtful, enlightening denouement from someone who clearly is an accomplished writer as well as the parent of a diabetic. I will not spoil the book in case someone wants to read it, but suffice it to say that I felt betrayed and disgusted by the ending.  My thought as I closed the book was, "With all the books on my shelf to be read, why did I waste time on this?" My advice, "Don't. 
 I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books. 
 Reagan's campaign autobiography is titled _Where's the Rest of Me?_, based on a line from one of his movies.  Unfortunately, Cannon has amputated a lot of Reagan in the second volume of his biography.  (The other volume is Governor Reagan, and it is much, much better.)  Much of the book is based on leaks, kiss-and-tell interviews, and the various Iran-Contra reports.  As a result, the book is not a fair picture of Reagan but is really the revenge of administration officials.  As a result, the book has a lot of inside information, but Cannon has not put it in context.  Even worse, there is very little of Reagan in the book.  Most of the material describes what Reagan's staff is doing to each other, and there is plenty of in-fighting.  There's very little of Reagan's thoughts or actions.  For example, you get David Stockman's understandably bitter view of economic policy, but there is almost no discussion of the longest postwar economic boom, except an attempt to debunk it.  Mostly he portrays Reagan as asleep and uncomprehending.  It is highly telling that Cannon has not cited in his bibliography any documents from the Reagan library.  He only seems to quote Reagan's diary when it was used by the Tower Board during its investigation of Iran-Contra.  So this is a book about Reagan's chiefs of staff, counselors, and a few cabinet secretaries.  They are interesting people, but it's not a Reagan bio.  My final complaint is that the book is written in stream-of-consciousness.  Cannon describes whatever events he thinks of next, so there is little overall organization to the book.  He jumps years between paragraphs.  For instance, he doesn't mention the air-traffic controller's strike until he is discussing the re-election campaign, when it has only a tenuous connection to the matter at hand.  Major events are hardly covered at all, such as the assassination attempt.  So I still have no overall understanding of the themes and organization of Reagan's presidency.  Nonetheless, the book does have some strengths.  Cannon is an interesting writer, so you'll enjoy his prose.  He also has a lot of interesting inside information gained by his years as a reporter for the Washington Post and many years reporting on Reagan in California.  For example, he seems to have a good understanding of Nancy Reagan, probably because Michael Deaver was a key source.  Also, he provides insightfuly analysis about Iran-Contra, the MX missile deployment, the 1984 re-election, and the first budget.  His discussion of the different types of intelligence and the ones that were strengths for Reagan is very useful.  Note that even the revised version of the book ends with Reagan leaving the presidency in 1989.  It also begins with him taking office in 1981.  Overall, I CANNOT recommend the book.  It might be a good supplement if you already understand Reagan's presidency well.  But if this is the only book you read about him, you'll be left in confusion and with a biased portrait by a reporter who mostly seems to disparage Reagan 
 I read this book and I can't figure out what Banks was trying to say. I was thoughouly confused for days wondering what was going on. I would love for someone to tell me what it was that I read, becasue I certainly don't know 
 I will keep this short and simple: Friedwald is a bad writer. This book contains a lot of bad jokes, forced analogies, a juvenile prose style and some occasional mistakes. However, this book is invaluable for someone who knows little about jazz singing, for it contains much information and most, if not all, the really important names in vocal jazz. However, if you are a more experienced listener, you will be put off by his off-handed dismissals of legends like Helen Merrill and talented minor figures like Lee Morse and Julie London, with little or no justification for his dislike of them. But he praises people like Perry Como, Dinah Shore and Doris Day. Hmmmm 
 Walpola Rahula's book is simply put, Theravada dogma which pushes the belief that the Buddha taught natthatta, namely, there is no self.  Rahula makes a number of claims about what the Buddha taught which have no basis in original Buddhism.  For example, Rahula gives a confusing account of the Five Aggregates (Pali, khandhas).  He omits any serious discussion of why the Buddha does not identify his own self with the Five Aggregates or why the Buddha always deprecates the Five Aggregates declaring them, for example, to be the Buddhist devil, Mara the Evil One.  It never seems to dawn on Rahula that the Buddha, in his many discourses, is deploying the via negativa (Grk. apophasis) with regard to the Five Aggregates.  The Buddha is really saying that our true self is other than these illusory Five Aggregates; and that we should have a revulsion towards them instead of the self!  This book deserves careful scrutiny.  And let the beginner beware, this book draws a terribly nihilistic conclusion about Buddhism.  It is ironic to note that three months before the Buddha dies he said the following: "My life is fully ripe, my life is at an end, I shall depart from you, I have made a refuge for the self. 
 Am I the only person who found this book to be shallow?  I actually couldn't finish it!  I got about halfway through and got tremendously irritated with two things: the first one is the author's focus on apparently gossipy details - like Tenzin Palmo's early love conquests.  It seemed an awful lot like the undertone was "Look at this woman!  She became a nun, and it's not because she was socially shunned by men!"  This introduced a note of melodrama that really doesn't suit the subject matter.  Now, the second part that really bothered me: The title of the book is "Cave in the Snow" not "Small cottage in the mountains".  I had to put the book down when I read the sentence about the DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOWS that were installed in her "cave"  COME ON!  It is amazing what she did, living in the himilayas on her own (except for those annual shipments of goods to last her the year).  I would have been interested to read about that.  But the author had to create melodrama and insinuate that Tenzin Palmo lived in a cave - the cave was bricked in, repaved, installed with a window with DOUBLE GLAZING, there was a patio out front, and a terraced garden.   I'm not saying that Tenzin Palmo doesn't deserve all the credit that she has received - she has truly blazed a trail for all women in buddhism, however the author's attempts to create interest border on melodrama and significant inaccuracy.  
 I would have given this film 0 stars if possible.  This film was long, boring, and painful to watch.  If you like Jane Austen films or other BBC period films, do not be deceived by this one; it is nothing like those types of films 
 Peter Lynch's book held me back about 10 years in my investing success.  I used to believe things I read in books because a good publisher like Simon and Schuster would publish it.  I counted cars in parking lots of companies with due dilligence and questioned managers on how things were selling.  I also avoided "reading tealeaves" like drawing trendlines on what I was actually concerned about THE PRICE of the stock!  Now I make a living "reading tealeaves" and leave the parking lot duty to those who think counting cars makes the price go up.      My suggestion is to learn basic technical analysis from a book like John murphys Technical Analysis of the financial markets.  Start there then go on to learn more advanced TA.  I also like Investor's Business Daily-BUT it is very specialized and takes reading several times and probably help from a more advanced user to understand IBD.  I also swingtrade - hold stocks for 2-5 days sometimes longer.     
 I've recently discovered Krentz at a local library. I've read most of her works by now, and her formula is a little worn from being used so often. I keep reading her mostly because there are flashes of brilliance in her  works that promise to be something more, but all of them then get lost.  Grand Passion is the worst of the lot -- I figured out the mystery of the  paintings by the second or third chapter, and the suspense and romance was  so unrealistic I was skimming every other sentence just to have the relief  of getting to the end 
 As a former military hand-to-hand combat instructor I can say that while this book contains horribly ineffective information, it contains things that are commonly taught in the military.  Regardless of what some say, the military teaches hand-to-hand combat to primarily teach aggressiveness, not effectiveness.  There are things that the military teaches that are quite asinine.  However, the main goal for 99% of the military is to teach aggressiveness.  For example, the US Army Rangers teach Gracie Jujitsu for Christ sake.  They go out to the wrestling mats and roll around.  Why?   To teach you to be aggressive.  If you think you can wrestle wearing 70 pounds of gear, carrying a rifle, and after marching 20 miles through rough terrain, then you should be able to qualify for handicapped plates.  Does this book contain information that is commonly taught to the US Special Forces?  Yes it does.  Does it work effectively when faced by criminal violence?  It's not really supposed to 
 I've had my Micro for over a year now, and when it worked, I loved it! However, I'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue; the sound is output in layers, and I am constantly trying to "reposition" my headphones to get full sound. My husband called Creative Labs for assistance, and he was told that it would cost him [...] per month for a "customer service subscription." After reading these reviews, it seems we'd be paying Creative Labs [...] so that they could tell us there's nothing they can (or will) do. Next brand, please...  
 Rush Limbaugh - the man most responcible for replacing the biased liberal media with the biased conservative media - giving millions of Americans false hope and dangerous half-truths.  I've had enough of this marketing phenomena known as "conservatism."  They have created a demographic group for the sole purpose of selling books and merchandise.  The anti-Clinton/Moore/Kerry books are the same junk as the anti-Bush/Cheney/Reagan books.  No on is interested in opening their mind  and learning-they simply want to reinforce their own shallow ideas, entertain themselves and feel comfortable in their own little imaginary world.  Forums hosted by so called Conservatives are run in the same close minded ways in which college liberals shout down any guest speaker with whom they disagree.  Meanwhile, the two parties (the only choice the American voter is given) are virtually the same when it comes to the most important issues.  Both parties are taxing and spending, and supporting the illegal invasion of America by Mexicans.  Big business is in bed with big government and they are both getting even richer by selling you books pretending to speak ill of each other.

 I am not sure why this book was written, except maybe, the author wanted to add another title to his published works. This book is basically comprised of briefs from various chapters of the author's two previous books (which were very good, by the way). If you have read his two previous books and/or you are a seasoned manager, the book is repetetive and boring. The author gives many examples of real life scenarios but the stories go on and on for pages. A good book to read if you can't fall aslee 
 I bought this book because I'm venturing more deeply into interior photography after many years of portraiture and architectural/travel work. This "updated and expaned" edition has simply tacked on a couple of cursory chapters on digital photography to a tired and outdated manuscript that needs reworking from top to bottom. You won't learn much here, with a lot of topics, almost all covered inadequately. The author appears to know whats he's doing (judging from the sample photos) but he's revealing very few secrets. I've learned a lot more through trial and error. If you're interested in interior lighting, for example, consider John Freeman's Lighting for Interiors. It's dramatically more useful 
 It is tough to appreciate the spirit and enthusiasm that these tunes usually convey. Good song selection, but it sounds like this was recorded by a 30 piece high school band in their band room. I highly recommend going directly to your favorite college web site and purchasing their own arrangement and recording. No band can play any other school's song with the same emotion given to their own fight song 
 I had a problem with the Veronica doll sold by MEGA Toyland (ASIN: B00081FP3I) but the seller addressed my concerns immediately and much to my satisfaction. I have deleted my original comment, but can't revise my star rating--would if I could 
 In a very convoluted plot, Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tautou) are chased through the streets of Paris and London by the French police and a crazed religious fanatic named Silas. It's your typical Hollywood action-thriller in most respects. Yes, it's silly and unrealistic. But if that's all there were to it I might go along with the "it's only a movie" argument.   Unfortunately, this movie is also full of ideas, ridiculous ideas that run counter to the historical facts. As an atheist, I certainly have no problem that the movie brings up some of the darker moments in Christian history. For example, the Inquisition, the witch burnings and the Crusades are all mentioned. Yet these actual historical events are only brushed over. Instead the movie focuses on making up some bizarre conspiracy theory that the Catholic Church is involved in a grand cover-up to prevent the public from knowing the truth about Christianity. For example, it states that not only were Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had children but that their bloodline has continued to the present day. They also portray a secret Catholic society that is involved in murder plots, strange sexual rituals and all manner of evil activities. It's completely fair to challenge the Church on its grave errors. For example, the shameful Inquisition involved the murder and tortue of many innocent people. I also disagree with the Vatican's present opposition to legal abortion and birth control. However, the sort of ridiculous conspiracy theory that this movie suggests is the worst sort of anti-Catholic bigotry. It's also dangerous to society as a whole as demonstrated by how similar lies and falsehoods have been historically used against Jews to justify brutal acts of anti-Semitism, including the Holocaust. No, I don't think it's likely that the "Da Vinci Code" will lead to the mass execution of Catholics. But any time a particular group is scapegoated it's a potential source of trouble.   Basically, "The Da Vinci Code" is a bunch of mumbo jumbo, distorted information and flat out lies that are not supported by the evidence. But, unfortunately, as P.T. Barnum said, "there's a sucker born every minute," and some people are going to believe this nonsense. History is a complex subject and I have no respect for people, whether they be the book's writer, Dan Brown, or the film's director, Ron Howard, who play fast and loose with the truth in order to make a buck. This is garbage. Don't waste your time 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 I don't normally writereviews...but this book is bad !  every second sentance is "Clinton-Gore Administration" did this or that wrong.  It is just 200 pages of Clinton bashing - nothing more.  Also it is very poorly written - a Pulitzer Prize this author will never receive.  
 tom martinez is a joke he snitched on his comrads to keep his ownself out of trouble when he was the one that passed the bill that led them to question him.the accounts that he told in the story does not add up to much.if you want the truth write bruce carrol pierce at the levenworh us prison in kansas or "richard sucitari at the usp in florence co, last i heard richard was still there. the both are very informitve and usualy have kind words to say. i would have rated 0 but there isnt one so 1 is all i could d 
 I know that this was a memoir, but at one chapter, the title is definately misleading, and many of the goals and events received highly biased coverage.  Ms. Zia begins with a survey of history of how Asians were treated in America.  While I agree that the treatement was not ideal and certainly horrific by today's standards, there is absolutely no historical context here.  Unfortunately, Blacks were treated MUCH worse.  Catholics were vilified far before Asians were, and for much longer.  The way she presents things, you would only think that Asians were getting the short end of the stick.  She also harps on the lack of positive images of Asians in the media.  She self selects a small sampling, while there has been an increasingly large number of positive Asian role models in American culture.  Do the Italians whine when most Italian characters in media culture are mobsters?  She even imagines slights where they don't exist - for example, Sulu in Star Trek.  He was hard working to be sure (not that there is anything wrong with that), but as any fan of the series will tell you, he DID have a swashbuckling side to him.  If there is anyone who was emotionless and hard working, that would have been Spock, played by a white.  Besides, Sulu eventually made captain of the best vessel in the fleet.  So much for a negative image.  She gets into the issue of ethnic casting, focusing on Miss Saigon.  Well, it works both ways.  If only Asians can portray Asians, then Asians shouldn't portray whites either.  Too bad Lucy Liu.  Her character in Charlie's Angels was WHITE in the series, but was made half-Asian in the movies.  Opps, Lucy isn't even half Asian.  I would like to see Helen come over here to Asia to complain about the negative images of foreigners.  How many negative images of foreigners exist in Hong Kong and Japanese movies?  There was an advertising campaign here in Taiwan where a company had three white men in jail costumes after being arrested.  Foreigners are constantly portrayed by media outlets in several Asian countries in a negative light.  Why can't you get on your soapbox about that?  She comments on how many Asians are complemented on their English even if they have been in the U.S. their whole life.  Well, how many people who look white in Asia have been here their whole lives, but are still referred to as foreigners?  It works both ways Ms. Zia.   She also gets into her homosexuality.  What does THAT have to do with Asian American Dreams?  Like most Americans, those of Asian descent are opposed to homosexuality.    Finally, there is the notion of hyphenated Americanism (though she technically doesn't succomb to it because the omits the hyphen.)  She wants Asians to be treated as equals in America.  I have no problem with that.  I would like to see the same thing.  However, when you put your ethnic homeland BEFORE American in what you call yourself, how do you think you will ever be accepted as truly American 
 Oh yes, Stacie Ferguson is goddamn sexy, we should everybody spend our money on her by buing a Wack Eyed Peas CD and this art of a CD-single. She's real, yes, the one they call natural beauty, she hardly knows what's plastic surgeon about. Everywhere she goes she stays just naturally pretty and sexy...   What I just told is as true as this song was good masterpiece of art 
 I've got to be honest, I couldn't finish this book.  I couldn't even get through the introduction because I was so angered and offended by two comments: 1) large breasts are an abnormality caused by an overactive pituitary gland and 2) small hands are a malformation.  My reaction to this was to take my overactive pituitary gland and malformed limbs and go find another book to read.  Attacking other women for the genetics that define their body types is NOT what feminism should be about 
 I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.  Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do? 
 The contents of "The Passover Plot" is pure tripe.  If Hugh Schonfield had realistically thought about what had happened 2000 years ago, then he would have realized that; 1) Jesus was scourged at a pillar where anywhere from 2-4 men whipped him mercilessly with metal attached to the ends of the leather whips.  They ripped into his flesh and muscle causing bleeding, contusions, probably cracked ribs and bones and chunks of flesh and muscle to hang off of his body.  This type of torture was used to weaken the victim into total submission thus making crucifixtion easy for the Romans.  2)After that they placed thorns on his head and pressed them into his skull causing bleeding and terrible pain to add to what he had already gone through. 3)Next he had to carry a piece of his cross weighing approximately 75-125 pounds through the streets until he could no longer do it himself after his brutal torture.  4) Then he was laid on the ground and had his hands and feet nailed to a cross and had his body stretched so far on the cross that ligaments and bones were stretched until they popped out of place.  Three hours on the cross with all of his weight on his nail driven hands and feet and then a spear in his side.  I don't think that he was some sort of prankster, just doing this for laughs.  He was the Son of God and the author should remember the following:  When you want a seat at a table in the club called "Eternity", they'll check to see if he gets "Smoking or Non-Smoking" 
 The information printed by Amazon.com in their description of this book bears little relationship to the new Pelican paperback. The paperback is a facsimile of the 1911 edition. I myself wrote the description used here by  Amazon to describe the Pelican book. What I wrote refers to the Quellen  Company's enlarged and annotated edition, which has foreword and  introduction, and six appendices telling about the publication of the  original book, the two plays produced from the book, and the silent movie  made from it. Also, many illustrations not in the original book, or the  Pelican paperback. A lot of original research went into gathering and  putting together this material. I believe the description may convey an  erroneous impression to prospective purchasers of the Pelican book. I did  not authorize the use of this material to describe any other book than my  own, because, oviously, it does not describe any other book! Signed:  Quentin Burke, editor of the enlarged, interpretive edition of  "Barbara" and of the commemorative edition of  "Barbara." Both are hard cover and both are obtainable from  Amazon.com 
 Ordered all 3 Alton Brown books.  The cooking and baking books are loaded with info for curious cooks and bakers.  The kitchen manual you could do without and your money could be better spent buying a good 3 ring binder and some good paper for making notes and writing down recipes 
   So the first thing you need to know about this movie is that it sucks. It really does. I'm not sure who their military consultant was, but if Samuel L. has Specialist pins on his collars, you don't call him Sargeant. Women aren't allowed in the Rangers (Nunez), not my rules ladies, Colonel Styles looks a little young to be a colonel (even for the Army), the Army doesn't issue tiger stripe BDU's (Mueller), the list goes on and on. This may not seem that important, but if you're gonna make a movie about the Army, you could at least get some very BASIC (soory, could't resist) things correct.      Yes, it's true that there are many twists and turns in this 'plot', but all that really means, at least in this case, is that they can multiply a weak and thin screenplay. Hey, if we tell the same story a couple different ways, it makes the story really interesting, right? Not so much. Oh, and that scene where "Specialist" West is standing on top of that shack with his pancho blowing like a villains cape? Wow, who decided that was a good idea? I don't want to ruin the ending for you, because there's no point in even seeing this movie, and anyone with enough brain cells to operate the remote will figure out the 'finale' long before it makes its belated arrival. By the way, how do you follow someone in an Army Humvee w/out them knowing? Seriously. Please spend these 90 or minutes talking with your kid's, reading a book, excercising, writing a review... I dunno, something worthy of your precious time. You've been warned.  By the way, Connie Nielsen looks hot w/ short red hair 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 Sorry, I'm a big fan of the first two D.F. CDs. Anxiously awaited the third...bought it without hesitation...mmm, sadly disappointed. The magic the first two brought to the world is what seemed to set them apart.  Cosmic, mysterious and almost spooky. So fitting to the groups name, Deep  forest made me feel sensuously connected to the natural world. Comparsa on  the other hand, though it must certainly fill the musicians desires to  expand their creative global conquest, fans like myself feel abruptly  misdirected. Harsh, tinny, fast Latin rhythems, overwhelm a majority of the  otherwise liquid and textural backbeat tracks. I just can't seem to kick  back and drift away with this latest endeavor. Unfortunatly, it reminds me  more of a Nature Company Latin sampler (don't get me wrong, I love the  works of groups such as B-Tribe). But if you're expecting more of the same  to come out of this beloved duo, get ready for a hard right. Perhaps their  next albumn will return to a kinder, gentler world 
 I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I put it down in frustration.  It reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat. The theme is interesting, the execution poor.  Cannot recommend 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 This book has absolutely nothing to do with the Magic Bullet Blender; it is just a little organic cookbook.  The title is  very misleading. Since there was no description of any kind, I assumed it referred to the Magic Bullet Blender. Big mistake! There is not one recipe in it that I would use, unless, of course, I want to make 2 kinds of ketchup.  The "magic bullets" that the author refers to are "Delicious recipes rich in bioflavinoids and other natural food factors that are the "Magic Bullets" against our most serious ailments" 
 While this book may be good for an absolute first timer, it is a total waste of money for a familiar user.  I purchased it in hopes of learning how to properly use the instruments for approaches/landing and the control tower.  All of the lessons in the book refer you back to the "Learning Center" (on your computer) - why even bother using this book.  For someone looking to have a paper reference to coach them through something, this book is not it!  I wanted a step by step lesson and it gave me "try the Learning Center."  It also skips over a lot of the key steps and assumes you already know how to do certain things.  What makes this book even worse is that it doesnt even provide a list of common commands.  My advice: Don't Bother 
 This is a spiteful, hateful man who is out of his element outside of linguistics.  And he got that wrong, as well

 I was confused by the many examples. Most of the times I did not see how they fit together in the theory. Perhaps I would have appreciate it more, had I known some algebraic geometry first 
 My daughter is almost three, and she was so excited when she received this for Christmas.  Unfortunately, the strings do not work, and also the star buttons are supposed to play notes and/or chords, and they don't work, either.  I was going to send for a replacement because my daugher absolutely loves this, and I was so disappointed when Amazon responded there are no replacements available.  I'm going to see if the manufacturer can replace it 
 This book is a guide to psychological manipulation of the church, geared toward leaders that want to move the church in a different direction whether it is scriptural or not.  If you are resistant to what they want to implement, this book will instruct them on how to fool you and draw you in, even using false flattery and kindness as a tool.  If you are not easily taken in they will ostracize you, making you appear to be the problem and perhaps even recommend you leave. Deception and cunning are key words here.  If church leaders will stoop to the levels suggested in this book, they are not led by God, but by their own flesh and are not worthy of term 'leader. 
 This book has plenty of tunes,but presents them very poorly. The small print of the tunes and the placement of two on a page makes reading very testing for a musician. Also the chord changes on some tunes,the bebop  tunes in particular,are wrong. This book is good for the casual player,but  one who is looking for decent representation of the music should look into  other sources 
 It was probably fascinating in its day but based on today's standards, it is pretty old fashioned 
 After reading other reviews, I ordered this book. I've worked with SQL Server since version 4.2 and just wanted a resource for new features. I was very disappointed. I found very little of use.   Integration Services is new and I looked forward to the chapter on the topic. There is nothing in the book to explain the design or graphical use of SSIS. Everything is programatic. I followed it through the chapter. It was difficult to follow and to set up. When I got to the end of the chapter, it said data flow (a common use of SSIS) was beyond the scope of the chapter and referred the reader to Books Online.  My experience is that you might as well use Books Online as this book. I own many technical books. This one I sent back 
 Jonny left edgy guitar slinging blues-rock quite a while back if you did not realize.  His current amalgamation is more of a hodgepodge than concert of styles for my taste.  I would have preferred a harder core gospel as Dylan did with 'Saved'.  Two stars only because as Gospel there is much better to be found.  If it was under the Contemporary Christian category I would go three stars. (He is still touring bars/clubs and not the church circuit yet though.) Probably no stars anymore for blues or rock. 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 Although he is a very talented and highly illustrator I get the feeling that he wanted to just whip out some drawings to get it published. There are pages where there is only a head or a small figure w/o reason. Most of the sketches (but not all ) looked hurried not worthy as publishing material. Be aware the sketches are only B/W 
 Don't waste your money on this book. I will finish the book because it is our book club choice. The characters are shallow and  self centered. The writing is middle school quality. Kris Radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water. No poetry and no beauty, I could care less about the women in this book. Who could possibly think life's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine? I treasure my sisters and women friends but I wouldn't want to be a friend to any of these women. I would give it no stars if I could 
 Even at a cheap price, its not worth it, spend a few $$$ more and get a better machin 
 This sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access.  However it is not a good sharpener.  It sharpens knives but not well. Also, it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash.  Probably half a year and it will be useless. Spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year.    
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 Tsukiyama knows hwo to write beautifully, BUT her metaphors and poeticisms feel too contrived. This novel is for lonely, flighty housewives. If you enjoy daytime soaps and/or exoticized perversions of the Asian culture, you'll love Dreaming Water 
 Generally speaking the design is a good idea.  Too bad the bottles don't seal well.  The lids are poorly maufactured/designed and do not seal properly.  As a test, I put water in one of the bottles and put the lid on nice and tight then turned the bottle on it side and watched the water run out.  This is not good for spices as they will not keep well if the container is not sealed 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I'm all for the light, "chick-lit" genre, but this book was really sub-par.  I felt like I was reading a grade school book report, where one re-words encyclopedia entries to avoid plagerizing.  The characters and movies depicted were laughable they were so bad.  I almost didn't finish this book and I honestly cannot remember the last time I did that. Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library and did not waste my money on it.  Rachel Pine should look for a different career.  Writing is not her forte 
 ...out quickly within the first 100 pages.  I was very intrigued with the premise of the novel--poor little rich girl has to learn to make it on her own.  I thought, this one could be really fun!  However, what I found instead was a story about a walking doormat, who let everyone and their family up to the 6th cousins take advantage of her.  With this statement, I have in mind visions of MYRON floating through my head.  At one point, Rachel has a box of macaroni and something else left in her fridge, with no money to get more food to make it through a whole week, but she blithely shrugs off Myron's raid on her pantry.  Her attitude is, "Who cares if he eats all my food and clutters up my house?  He's my FRIEND".  This attitude safely does fall under the TSTL category, which I was relieved to see another reader point out.  Furthermore, Rachel teaches a weaving class OUT OF POCKET...and we're all expected to believe she does it out of the goodness of her little heart, and for sheer love of weaving?  Please!  I could understand Rachel waiving the wee for a student or two, or bringing weaving materials for a student or two, but PAYING HERSELF for the class to take weaving?  Come on!  No one is that desperate and lonely that they need to PAY for other people to enjoy their company!  And if they are, I certainly don't want to read about them!  One of the worst and most annoying things about this book was the horrid slang Julia London had Flynn speak in.  I could understand a few slang comments thrown in, but his entire character spoke in dialect.  (Most people, when taking beginning writing courses, are warned to use "dialect" SPARINGLY.  So what does Julia London do?  She writes a whole character who speaks in nothing BUT dialect.  Help me rip out all the hairs on my head one by one for each "nancy boy" and "bit of all right" and "I rather suspect..." and "lucky chaps"!)  Two of my best friends are British, and do they speak like that?  NO!  They have a few expressions we don't use in America, but they still speak ENGLISH!  Instead of being charmed, I was desperately annoyed.  One more thing that bothered me was the way Rachel's dad was painted as a horrible villain who, although dying, didn't deserve to see his daughter for Thanksgiving.  No matter how awful your parents are, if they're dying, you could at least agree to go spend the holidays with your family!  This coming from a girl who pays for other people to take her classes, who rescues kittens from cruel owners, and who buys groceries for a vilely grouchy widower.  But yet we're expected to believe she won't go see her dying father for the holidays?  Whaaaat?  Oh no, he tells her she needs to finish school--she's THIRTY!  What does she expect?  Yet of course, once she starts having a relationship with a man and falls in love, she suddenly is able to finish her long-stagnant thesis.  Gag me!  Now, after all my ranting, were there any redeeming qualities to this novel?  I'll admit, there was quite a lot wrong with this novel.  However, I did enjoy the way Rachel's character tried to take her life into her own hands by doing things she'd never been good at before.  She stopped whining about being overweight and went to the gym, she stopped saying she could never get a date and started flirting with a nice, normal seeming guy.  Also, the tone of the novel was mostly light and humorous, especially throughout Rachel's first encounters with Flynn.  It made the novel more appealing and comedic, which I enjoyed.  However, all in all, I found Rachel's repeated put-downs of herself to be too much of a hindrance to the story, and her newfound self-confidence blossomed much too late in the story for me.  Sorry guys, but I give this one a miss.  
 I have to strongly disagree with the editorial and reader reviews on this essay, even though it was a national bestseller. The book is touted as possibly the most rational description of a descent into morbid, clinical depression and suicidal despair. I didn't find it so. Styron was descriptive but rather than probing and baring the depths of his mind and emotions during his depression, I felt he only hinted at the tip of the iceberg. I didn't find any riveting, palpable tracing of his depression. It was rather moribund for a subject with such potential. There is a detachment throughout that many attribute to Styron's calculating dismantling of his own emotions to throw light into the abyss. I found the detachment sort of hovering over the pond, unwilling to dive in, which robs the reader. Candor, yes in some aspects. Precision, somewhat missing.  He quotes Dante "In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a dark wood, for I had lost the right path." Styron was in the melancholia described by Dante but he never succeeds at identifying why or even how he managed to eventually recover.  From what most reviewers have said, this book should have been the definitive treatise on deep depression, written by a survivor. It is not that impressive at all 
 Women-in-prison films are supposed to be erotic!  That means they're supposed to have AT LEAST ONE of the three following things (and preferably MORE than one):  1)  An evil lesbian warden who enjoys the bodies of her pretty prisoner-playthings, turning at least one of them into her beautiful nude sex slave.  2)  Evil lesbian guards who occasionally strip the girls naked before whipping/spanking them, and later take them into their own quarters for their private pleasures, especially late at night.  3)  Tough, lesbian inmates, who prey on the younger, most beautiful newcomers, often in the shower, but also in their beds at night.  Well, this particular video HAS NONE OF THESE THINGS!  There are NO LESBIANS in this prison!  There are only gay male guards and a boring old man as the warden.  The women are certainly pretty enough and their outfits revealing enough, but as a women-in-prison flick THIS ONE SUCKS!!!  IT'S NOT EROTIC!!!  NOT RECOMMENDED!!! 
 As stated above, to date (August 13, 2006) I have yet to receive this book which was ordered on 7/13/06 
 I am a graduate student in organizational development.  Although this book has some good underlying concepts, I found most of the book hard to follow and not very engaging.  It was often difficult to see how many of the concepts actually apply to organizations.  There may be good ideas, but they often get lost in the rambling chapters 
 This flan pan is very flimsy, and don't hold up well 
 u cannot finish this on 24 hours. I have Flash background but I finished "chapter 5" in 13 hours, which was supposed to finish in 5 hours. Sooooooo many text and difficult for ESL students. Not step by step and not too many graphic. No CD or resource files to do tutorials 
 I read this book, aafter I had seen the movie several times and I must say, Elizabeth Levy left out alot of the Romance and other things. But she did put a different view on things. I would give it 2 1/2 stars, but I  can't 
 This book breezes through the basics and then isn't able to deliver on the advanced. There's very little information about the features and functions but I did find a section on how to dress!!! This is supposed to be about the program POWERPOINT, not about presentation basics.   I specifically wanted to understand more about programming templates and add-ins...nothing helpful at all, and sadly, not even enough for a beginner to get a good foundation in this very important concept in powerpoint and in all office components.   I was very disappointed and will be returning it as soon as I can wrap it up and ship it back. 
 The previous books in the Kincaid series were clever for the most part.  Not this one.  William Bernhardt discovered his thesauraus for this entry in the series and his soap box.  Clearly William Bernhardt felt his political views needed to come through - and they do.  Repeatedly.  Made the book boring 
 I was looking for a more detail book and I found this one too basic 
 Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.   
 This trash-book is too much absurd.Santa claus isn't morer absurd than this trash-book.Please, don't waste your money or time, reading this trash-book 
 We purchased lots of LeapFrog products but this is the one we are very disappointed with. The toy can be put together very easily but it stopped working in one day. We were told to clean the battery compartment with alcohol but it still didn't work. Since we purchased it through Amazon, we had to wrap it up and returned it and paid for shipping and handling. We called LeapFrod and found out they have lots of issues with this particular product. 
 I bought this book on the recommedation of the Tom Peters' "50" books.  I've so tried to extract some value out of it, but Schrage goes on and on without seeming to get to the point.  This book seems to be a mismash of Shrage's notes collected over the years.  Yes, simulations change the way we work and interact, but how can we best use them to communicate ideas or speed delivery of new products?  I derived much more value from Tom Peters merely encouraging me to prototype than from "Serious Play" 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 Put simply, it's an odd mixture of current fashion, fiance drama, and - get this one - god 
 I am in complete agreement with reviewer "zmusicman" in absolutely panning this book.  I found The Sacred Romance to be so poorly written that at many times I could absolutely not understand what the point was at which the authors were clumsily trying to arrive.  Okay, one thing was clear:  God is courting us and trying to get us to enter into a "romantic" relationship with Him, which promises to enter us into the whirlwind adventure of our lifetime.  Hmmm, I have to wonder if the authors were somehow referring to the theological concept of Divine Eros, which has been expounded upon by the Church Fathers and in Orthodox Christian (and perhaps Roman Catholic?) theology.  However, their arguments and illustrations show that even if they have heard of Divine Eros their understanding of it is faulty and extremely shallow, resulting in a self-centered, thirsty for self-esteem sort of "I'm OK, You're OK" relationship with the almighty God.  This is not surprising in light of the fact that this book was written by "evangelical" counselors (not respected theologians) more bent on emotions and warm fuzzies than on the Truth in relation to God's relationship with man, man's fallen nature and sinfulness, the Eros of the Holy Trinity, Christ's Incarnation, etc.  The next big problem that I found lay not in the idea of "romantic" adventures in the Christian life (for if you read the lives of the saints you will find this, as this concept is not new, much to its credit.), but in the so-called messages of the heart and messages of the arrows.  Basically these are the things that either help or hinder our relationship with God.  However, according to Curtis and Eldredge, all of the wonderfully happy and pleasant things occurring in our lives are helpful and all of the not so pleasant, mean, and traumatic things that others have inflicted upon us are arrows from Satan to keep us away from God.  This is, of course, ludicrous and completely unscriptural as the Bible teaches that all things are under God's providence and, although the Devil can harm us, not every unpleasant and uncomfortable occurrence is necessarily from the Evil One or even to his temporary victory.  Many "arrows" are allowed to occur and are even blessed by God for our spiritual growth and health (obviously the cultivation of humility is not a big priority for these guys as it might make someone uncomfortable).  The result: humans remain a bunch of "whiny spiritual babies" who can't take the pain required to gain the Kingdom!  This is obviously dangerous to our souls and I fear that all of the earnest but misinformed readers and workbook filler-outers who buy into this pseudo-psychology (as tempting as it may sound) are placing themselves in spiritual danger.  Finally, I must return to my original critique in once again stating that this book is terribly written.  The authors rarely finish a coherent thought.  Entire chapters are presented without a lucid conclusion.  The quotes from scripture are taken out of context (such as the rambling on Job) and, worst of all, they use literature and film in an attempt to prove their theological assertions as being true.  I am not saying that fiction and the arts cannot contain glimpses of the truth, illustrate a point, or even be biblically based- of course they can.  However, they are not the Canon of Scripture or Church Tradition.  The last time I checked my Bible there was not a Gospel according to Forest Gump or an Epistle to the Last of the Mohicans (of which the authors referred only to the movie, not the novel).  Thus although these films most definitely contain Christian themes they cannot possibly prove theological precepts as being true or false!  On a different note, after reading about 145 pages of nonsense and boo-hoo heartstring tugs disguised as personal accounts on the spiritual life, the authors finally caught my attention with a rudimentary introduction to spiritual warfare.  "Alas", I thought to myself, "They are starting to speak my language!"  My excitement soon waned when two or three short pages later they made an offhanded and clumsy reference to the concept of spiritual "detachment" without even citing it as the drowning of the passions or crediting it to St. John Climacus' Ladder of Divine Ascent and the monastic tradition of the Orthodox Christian Church.  Why would they, after all?  Why not just make the public think that you've reinvented the wheel by making the spiritual life easy, carefree, and painless?  Self-denial, discipline, and obedience just don't sell books.  So Curtis and Eldredge apparently decided to merely borrow the term, clean it up, polish it and paint it, and present it to the unsuspecting masses in a spiritual "get rich quick/miraculous diet pill" sort of way: It might work, but it will most likely destroy you.  Come on Christians, its time to go back to your roots and seek the Truth of Christ.  He may ask you to change your ways, it may sometimes be unpleasant, but the pay off is eternal.        
 In simple words, Easy Rider is probably the most morally detestable film  I have ever seen. My impression of Hippies before seeing this movie, was that they were more or less just lazy(but peaceful)people. Now Hippies kinda disturb me. In the beginning of the film when they stopped for some food at the commune it was clear that the director wanted me to sympathize with the hippies. I  personally, however, could not have felt anymore different. There were kids running around everywhere not being watched, while adults irresponsibly thought only of themselves, wether that meant engaging in immoral behavior such as taking a swim naked or doing drugs. The odd thing is though that while drugs are never exactly glamorized (though done frequently by the heros of this), swimming naked is treated as if were innocent children's play. That seriously grossed me out. How could something so lustful and dirty, be thought of like that? Hippies are  just plain creepy.  Also its kind of hard to get around thae main characters. These guys were nothing more than no good drug smuggling degenerates. And yet they are the sad excuse the movie has in the place of heros. The director or one of the cast members I believe, on the making of Easy Rider, compared the two main characters to John Wayne. But If John Wayne ever played a hero as lowesome as these one,s the movie would just simple not be any fun.  Another problem in this movie was the South. They were potrayed as nothing,but lowesome biggots. Their hatred for the hippies unrealistically comes out of no where. Now I'll admit there are people like this, but to  generalize the entire south, is unfair.      Ultimately though I would have to say the worse part of this movie, was where they had LSD trip and the Apostles Creed(a Catholic prayer) was being recited. As strong practing Catholic, this could not have been more offensive. I had to leave the room  after about half way through the scene it disturbed me so much. I returned once it was over, though Frankly I wish I had never seen it in the first place. Everything from this scene represents what I hate about society. The hatred for Religion expressed is not very peaceful or loving. Long story short, this movie is about as immoral as they come.  P.S. I dont think I can ever look at my Steppenwolf CDs or Records in the same way again 
 I would rate this piece of film trash a "0", but unfortunately, that is not an available option. This stupid movie did not start the scene, but it did contribute to it. This review is to all of you ghetto monkey morons who think that because you have ground effects and an obnoxious sounding muffler, that somehow you have transformed yourselves into Mario Andretti and a Ferrari; I have some astounding news for you, the average citizen thinks you are an idiot with a license, and should be barred from ever contributing to the human populus. No one is impressed with your driving antics that endanger the rest of us on the roads and highways. In fact, everytime I read that one of you idiots died in a tragic accident due to your own ignorance and lack of driving skills, I actually celebrate with my friends, and we relieve ourselves on the grave, because there is one less stupid person on the road. Do the rest of the world a favor, save your money, don't make your car look stupid and ghetto, which in return, makes you look stupid and ghetto,learn how to drive safely, turn your hat around (facing forward), pick up your retarded looking baggy pants, put a belt on, and hide your underwear, (that no one wants to see, but laughs at you while you walk past) and speak a normal language that includes words besides "dawg" and other non-understandable neanderthal sounds that clearly indicate your lack of education and stupidity 
 This book is more a history of Bohemian style than anything else. The photos are uninspiring, dated and not at all what I considered "Bohemian" to be.  It was a total disappointment. It IS hard to find books that show you how to decorate in an eclectic, ethnic and Bohemian style which is what I was lookin for. In the end I've decided to add ALL ethnicities to my bedroom: Morrocan lamp, Mexican wrought-iron candelabra, Thai carved wood platform bed, rattan headboard, leopard skin chair, carved red Chinese armoire, and Indian-style entertainment cabinet!  Now that's what I'd call Bohemian 
 While I like about half of these bands music, it is just another spasm of moronic idiocy. Any college kid can get this palp form their professors. They don't need some know it all musician telling them the way it is! I mean, get a real job and see how it is. If you challenged any one of these guys to a debate I guarentee you would be dissapointed, if not a little emberassed for them. But hey, if you want to follow along like just antoher lemming, be my guest 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 After using this product for about a month and a half, I began to get very high blood pressure readings (157/106).  My doctor took my BP on the same day and got 130/80, which I also got with my manual cuff.  I find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well.  The only good thing about it is that you don't have to record your readings manually.  If they calibrate the machine properly, it would be a great thing, but I wasted my money 
 Yogananda's message is potentially world changing.  However, I got more out of the Autobiography of a Yogi published by Self-Realization Fellowship because it was full of added footnotes which I found just as important and meaningful as the text.  Many explaining the essential oneness of western and eastern religions through biblical passages, etc 
 On the shelf or on line, this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt. It took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging. My son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys. Yeah, the shovel portion drags on the floor and will NOT lock into position above the rig. This truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand. I grew up with Tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation. If your looking for a durable fun truck for your child, move on as this truck wont get the smile your looking for.   
 I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom.   The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?   This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it.  I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published! 
 I'd loved all the other Jack Ryan stories I'd read (though I hadn't read all of them).  This was a little too coarse and nowhere near as good as the earlier ones 
 but this one isnt all that bad, it has rarities in it. "emotion" by samantha sang is one of them. She vanished after that effort (which was produced by the BeeGees) but what a hit it was. I guess if you are going to soak the money into the complete series, you need this volume 
 Now that fine arts photography seems to be permanently entrenched in a rut, it seems as though the only way for photographers to get noticed is to become celebrity photographers. It is quite an easy formula: To become a celebrity photographer, one must immerse themselves in the mindless world of celebrities, and, thus through hyperbole and self-insertion into this world of celebrity, one becomes a celebrity him- or her- self. David LaChapelle is no exception to this sappy, self-serving, trend which began the moment Annie Leibovitz ran out of ideas.     It is no coincidence that LaChapelle is so often compared to Herb Ritts. Both of them produce technically strong work that, alas, has no soul. Both their work screams the triumph of style (and such schlocky, narcissistic and ultimately vapid style at that) over substance.    Ultimately, LaChapelle is an empty suit, now that the game in fine arts photography is not about achieving a unique vision -- wrought by years of mastering the craft of photography -- but in being seen as clever and trendy. The whole post-modern fraud -- in which LaChapelle is a routineer fellow traveller, posing as some sort of master of photography -- is predicated on the aesthetic equivalent of a hispter's sneer.    Strangely, though, LaChapelle's work is neither clever, nor hip. If you want clever, check out Weegee. For real hip photos daddy-o, peruse Phil Stern's pix of the Rat Pack. If you need to ride Madonna's coattails to notoriety, then hip is way over your head.    In Hotel LaChapelle, we are left bereft of inspiration and style. Certainly, the overly self-aware artiste gives a passable imitation of same, rather much as saccharine compares to honey. Strip this book of the glitz and the glam and we are left with a young photographer who has quite a store of technical know-how without the foggiest idea as to how he can put it to honest use.    To those comparing the ostentatious affectations of this posuer who fancies himself a photographer to Man Ray or Andy Warhol, pulllllleeeaase! Albeit, Warhol was oftentimes just as pretentious; however, Warhol did have some pretty striking ideas, and some of his graphic (re)creations were brimming over with the stark sensibilities of Roy Lichtenstein or Paul Rand. As for Man Ray, LaChapelle is way out of his league. Man Ray belongs up there with Magritte, Dali and Luis Bunuel; LaChapelle fits in a little better with other trendoids such as the photography staff of Us Magazine.    I find LaChapelle's work more akin to another hanger-oner of the celebrity scene, Yoko Ono. That's my story and I am sticking to it 
 I had to find out who is tormenting me over the cable radio they play at the gym.  It's this band.  Please make it stop.  If your favorite band is featured on "The OC" it's time to start thinking for yourself. 
 You can pick up a few good nutrition ideas here, and maybe one or two good recipes: but the pickings here are slim, in both areas.  This book is not a complete waste of money, and it's not terrific either: just so-so, any way you slice it 
 I recieved one of these for Christmas, I would love to tell you how it works.....but it is missing a plastic piece. Now to be fair, I lost it, in the confusion of Christmas it must have gotten tossed. I called Rival to purchase a replacement piece. What a joke. I emailed....no response. I called, they don't know what I am talking about (even though it is clearly listed in the instruction manual), or if I get a rep who does know what the piece is, they say they don't have one to sell, but if I want to pay to ship the unit back and forth,they will replace it. I have left voice mail messages for non-existent supervisors. So, instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece, I will return this to the store as defective and get the money back. They lose a sale, the store loses a sale, they get in return an unhappy former customer and a defective unit. DO NOT BUY RIVAL PRODUCTS, we need to start showing these big companies who hide in voice mail hells that we are tired of poor, illogical treatment 
 This book, short and terse, takes a reproachful tone and minimalist explanation style. My biggest crticism, though, is its lack of challenging words. Those who have no trouble telling apart "incite" from "insight," "disparage" from "disparate," and "plum" from "plumb" aught to look elsewhere to satisfy their intellectual curiousities. I was wholly disappointed with this book, but very glad to have found a replacement for it called "The Bibliophile's Dictionary," which is in every way superior.  This book is a reference for the laity and, in my unintentionally high-brow opinion, should be skipped 
 The cover blurb made this book sound amazing; if only it were as complex and fulfilling as it sounded.  The book is very dependent upon Katherine's character, yet she simply didn't mesh for me.  She didn't come off as dangerous or interesting; she sounded more like any immature, impulsive, hard-drinking twenty-two-year-old. And the plot seemed bogged down in a "Groundhog Day" scenario, the same scene happening over and over.  There were snippets here and there that showcased talented writing; I agree w/ the other reviewer that Sabina Murray seems more suited to short stories. Over all, the book seemed poorly edited, with no real cohesion or feeling that the plot was moving forward 
 Chris Van Alsberg's beloved Christmas classic is brought to the screen in this sickeningly self indulgent, outrageously overblown animated film. The characters are bland,and their movements are creepy and mechanical, both of which make them feel more like robots than humans. The film's biggest problem is that it dosen't seem to know whether to treat itself like a horror movie, a children's Christmas cartoon, or a slapstick comedy. The film overflows with half-baked ideas,for instance,there is a mysterious hobo-zombie who makes his home  on the train's roof and a room filled with abandoned toys. It is NOT an exaggeration to describe the film as creepy, as many other reviewers have. While not quite the ''cat''astrophe of the Seuess films,THE POLAR EXPRESS is still something of a train wreck.   SCORE:4/1 
 Actually, since a couple of the Yuen brothers did the choreography for this movie, it isn't really ripped off.  Corey Yuen Kwai did the action for 'Buddha Assassinator' and there is some sleeping style in this movie also, but I will get to the action in a minute.    Stephen Chow plays the king of beggars.  Once a rich young man and great in kung fu, he gets cheated out of everything he should have had by a government official.  He is now forced to become a beggar with his father.    The main problem is that the movie just doesn't flow together very well.  There is just too much beggar talk.  The story doesn't move along at all except at the start and end.  The rest is just mindless talking.    This starts out like a kung fu movie, but when Chow becomes a beggar, that becomes the main focus of the story.  The action is very good when it does happen and I loved the sleeping style.  Sleeping style has been used in a few older movies and it was nice to finally see it in a newer one, but they could have used it more.  The undercranking is way too fast but the fights are still pretty good.    2.5/ 
 This book does ask the right questions, on the power of prayer, the root of evil, the truth and historicity of the bible, etc., but its answers are essentially juvenile.  For instance, Schulweis writes about the Holocaust and asserts that the evil committed was seperate from God, as the work of free-willed humans, but that God was present in the non-Jewish people we sheltered and saved Jews from persecution.  This thinking brings up some serious questions.  Why were the good people less free-willed than the bad?  If God can intervene to save a few in cellars in Poland, why did He forsake the rest?  Most importantly, how does Schulweis know where God was and God wasn't?  Again and again throughout the book Schulweis tells us confidently and categorically that God is evident in good actions of people but absent in bad.  This is illogical.  On the subject of prayer Schulweis tells us that God doesn't literally hear our prayers, nor can prayers ignite miracles, but that prayer can strengthen us.  This idea directly contradicts the content of prayer in the Jewish liturgy which is primarily focused on adoration of the divine.  If all prayer can do is help us 'gird up our loins,' why pray to God?  Why invoke the supernatural, who Schulweis tells us will not listen to our prayers directly?  Surely there are better ways of strengthening oneself.    Schulweis gives us similar schtick on miracles.  He tells us not to expect actual miracles, like the regrowing of limbs, but to notice that everything is miraculous. This seems to follow Spinoza's view that God reveals himself in the laws of nature.  Well, if that's all He can do, if he is completely impotent otherwise, than why even bring God into the picture?  This is really just spiritual pantheism, or properly, dishonest atheism.    Unfortunately, I can't go on right now.  Essentially, there are so many logical flaws in the worldview Schulweis presents that I don't think anyone can honestly believe what he writes.   Skip this book 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 There are many good kung fu books, however, this isn't one of them.  If you think the book is interesting, it may be because the lack of knowledge you have about martial arts. Try beating a street fighter with those movements and see what happens.  On one of his web sites, Wong Kiew kit advice how to beat a boxer by using two Shaolin Kung Fu patterns, the supposed boxer throws some passive punches, then Wong Kiew Kit beats him by constantly repeating two patterns until the boxer is beaten. This is a weed-smoke fantasy, a boxer would bravely come over you throwing a bunch of direct, jab and uppercut punches until you fall unconscious, as well as a street fighter.   You won't  be able to defend yourself with the movements in this book, overall, you can't learn to fight from a book, you need to constantly practice your defenses and attacks in order to make them unconscious reactions, you can't think: "oh, I need to use the mirror pattern" when you are in the middle of a fight, you need unconscious reactions.  In this publication, Wong Kiew Kit himself says that you can not learn to fight from a book.  Also, the author is incompetent to remark how dangerous it may be to apply the pattern named "poisonous snake shoots venom". Someone without previous martial arts knowledge may think it's okay to use that as an attack, apparently it is just "one more attack" listed in the book, however, someone can get into big trouble or can even hurt (if not kill) a friend because of the author's incompetence to explain how dangerous a strike on the neck can be 
 I tried and tried to convince myself that this sounded good, or even acceptable.  Alas, the sound was so muddy, no matter what I did.  I set the EQ on treble boost, and I pressed the "3D" button on the unit.  Still as muddy and muffled as could be.  Besides that, there was a terrible sound between tracks that reminded me of a CD player searching for the next track.  Amazingly, I never hear this sound when using the nano with headphones.   I am returning this and moving up another price point when searching for my next small speaker set 
 I read this book and several others on the subject to help myself recover from a painful life-long relationship with an untreated, undiagnosed ADDer. My goal was to understand, and have compassion for those with ADD.  This book seems to be aimed at making those who have to live with ADD or ADHD feel good. In an attempt to make the ADDer feel better, he takes the approach that ADD is an outdated human survival mechanism that causes problems in our more organized society, therefore, it is not a "defect" or something that needs to be treated with medication.   The tendency to pile on fat is also such a mechanism, but that is no reason to consider it a "gift" or not seek ways to overcome it. The reality is that such things can pose very real health risks and the danger is that such opinions can assist those in denial to ignore the consequences of ADD/ADHD behavior on the family's health, happiness, and survival.  He also blames a lot of the increase in ADD on a society that watches TV, and an education system that stifles creativity. Many people try to link ADD with creativity as though one relies on the other. However, there are a lot of us that have grown up in the same environment as those with ADHD, but we manage to remember to pay the bills, we can maintain a job, and we manage to maintain healthy human relationships. And there are many artists, musicians and creative individuals who do not have ADD, and are no less successful for it.  If you are the parent of an ADD/ADHD child, there are some good tips for parenting. But if you are a spouse or child recovering from a disastrous relationship with someone with undiagnosed or untreated ADD, or if you are currently in a relationship with an adult with untreated ADD this book won't help you a bit.  There is no doubt that our society has been bad at helping those with ADD and our attitudes toward the behavior of ADD have caused self-esteem problems. However, the same is true of the overweight issue.  The bottom line is that ADD and ADHD has caused an untold amount of unhappiness for the person with ADD and the family. The behaviors of risk taking, the communication problems that manifest in relationship problems, and the impulsiveness and lack of self control that can lead to emotional or physical abuse are far too serious to be ignored. The exercises in the book are fine, but for anyone facing serious issues because of ADD behavior, think about medication to get the worst of the behavior under control. If medication can help treat it, I say, go for it. Then we can all sit in a circle and sing Kumbayah and rejoice in our "differentness" 
 As is generally the case, Dr. Laura directs her criticism/suggestions directly at her readers/listeners: "get your own act together and your life will fall into place."  There is, of course, a lot of wisdom in this.  Before making a laundry list of complaints about how other people are letting you down in your life, you probably should examine your own shortcomings.  This can definitely help put things into perspective (i.e., "yes my husband is insensitive and aloof, but maybe my constantly criticizing him isn't helping").  Dr. Laura goes on to give some decent advice on how women can improve their marriages: be friendly and cheerful with your hubby rather than bitchy and resentful, don't let yourself go to pot (keep your weight down and dress nicely), don't withhold sex.  Yes, your spouse will probably will be in a better mood if you are cheerful, look nice and eagerly welcome his sexual advances.  According to "the doctor" men are "simple creatures" (give them food and sex and they are happy), it's women who are chronically dissatisfied, constantly complaining and impossible to please.  She claims that the situation is made worse by the feminists who are always telling women falsehoods like: "men oppress women," "women who are housewives are unhappy," "women should seek, and expect sexual equality with men."  Of course, Dr. Laura isn't very clear about who "these feminists" are and she talks about "women's magazines" as if they were the voice of  "the feminists," even though most feminists would probably argue that magazines like Cosmo are more part of the problem than the solution.  There are a lot of women who call themselves feminists and very few see eye to eye on all issues.  However, I think most would agree that feminism is about giving women the opportunity to realize themselves in whatever capacity they choose.  This can mean as a wife and mother, as a professional or as both.  There may be feminists who look down on women who've chosen to be housewives, but there are at least just as many "feminist haters" who impugn women who have sacrificed motherhood in order to pursue dreams that were more important to them.  What's the difference?  Both are guilty of criticizing women who make choices different from their own in order to feel better about their own decisions.  Dr. Laura clearly errs is in her assertion that all women are happier being wives and stay-at-home moms and having a husband who provides for the family.  If this were the case, why did the 1950's (the epitome of traditional family-life) bring on the feminist movement in the first place?  Rather than becoming addicted to Valium or clamoring for more equality, why weren't women simply singing the praises of their wonderfully fulfilling domestic lives?  I think the answer is clear: a lot of women were extremely bored and unfulfilled without the intellectual and social stimulation that a life outside the home can provide.  Also, being economically dependent on another person puts you in a very vulnerable position if you are in a physically and/or emotionally abusive relationship.  It is very true that women today who are juggling careers and family are feeling their own dissatisfactions: they are overworked and feel robbed of time with their families and they feel like the do a disproportionate share of the work in the home. However, I don't think the answer lies in sending ALL women back to the traditional role of housewife.  At least now women have options.  If they decide staying at home and caring for children is the #1 priority in their lives, or that they simply cannot "do it all," then everyone should respect their decision.  If they prefer to juggle work and family or remain childless and free to pursue other ambitions, those are also decisions that should be respected.   Life is complicated and there are no one-size-fits-all answers to life's most important choices.  Dr. Laura tries to support her claim that ALL women REALLY WANT to be stay-at-home moms and cared for by a man with some study that "demonstrates" that partners in marriages that don't follow these traditional roles have higher rates of heart disease.  Rubbish!  You can always dig up some obsolete study to prove any argument you are trying to make.  There are A LOT MORE studies that show that single women are happier than married women (I'm not saying this so, I'm just saying that such studies say nothing about whether or not YOU will be happy in any given situation).  Particularly offensive is what Dr. Laura says about sex.  Essentially she argues that it is women's duty to provide their husbands with sex whenever they want it.  I agree that discrepancies in desire can be a problem in a marriage and that women should not make a habit of casually dismissing their husbands' sexual attentions.  However, there are "reasons" why many women are not as interested in sex as their husbands, the biggest one being that they are not getting the kind of sexual stimulation they need in the bedroom.  But, "the doctor" makes no mention of this.  She advices women to service their husbands and act like they are loving it ("men like to think that they are good lovers").  What about a little more communication?  What about telling your partner what you like?  What about some compromise?  No, according to the Dr. Laura, sex is what you give your husband in exchange for his ultimate sacrifice: his marrying you.  She even goes so far as to remind women that in some states we are legally obliged to do so (does she want to put women who don't behind bars?).  I guess on this issue I am "idealistic": sex should be something that is mutually satisfying for both men and women.  Life is probably more complicated for the modern woman, but this does not mean that it is worse.  In fact, I would argue that women have it better now than they have at any time in history.  Turning back the clock to a "simpler time" may seem like an appealing solution to today's overworked and highly-stressed women, but I sincerely doubt that it would provide any lasting satisfaction in most women's lives.  Women, as individuals, must decide for themselves what lifestyle is most gratifying.  The path Dr. Laura suggests is only one of many that "can" lead to a healthy, rewarding life 
 I received the wrong item, a videotape and emailed the address of the company that didn't send the book I ordered, but they didn't reply to my email. I tried to email Amazon about it, but ran into snags: your system wasn't working, etc. I finally had to take the book out of a college library, since it is out of print 
 I couldn't finish this book, and usually I finish books too quickly.  The reviewer who described her book/writing style as tedious wins the prize from me.  I think I would have liked her piece if she wrote differently.  But.. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.   Re: J Czecholinski  Hey J, you couldn't be more wrong! Your review is as flawed as Lahaye and Jenkin's unbiblical writing. First, I am a Christian who does believe that Jesus is coming back, but I do not believe He is coming back in a secret, silent rapture that the LEFT BEHIND series is making millions of Christians believe. I believe in the verse you used (to try and prove me wrong), which is 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves.Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.' When Jesus comes back, we will know it. Keys words being COMMANDING SHOUT and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD. We're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years. In the Bible, 7 years refers to completeness or totality, which is time until Jesus comes back for good. Lahaye and Jenkins are taking figurative language from John's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies. This adding to Scripture and polluting the word of God makes me think of Galatians 1:6-9 which says: "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!" This is what Lahaye and Jenkins are doing: perverting the gospel with their own spin. And your "belief" in the anti-Christ is incorrect as well (along with Lahaye and Jenkins). Check out these verses: 1st John 2:22 "Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son." or 1st John 4:3 "...but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world." Key words their being EVEN NOW IS ALREADY IN THE WORLD. This is referring to SATAN who was in the world in John's day and still in the world. The Bible says in 1st John 2:18 that many anti-Christs have come and anti-Christ is anyone who is against Christ. There are many people who are persecuting the Church and Christians (as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd Timothy 3). Why are we looking for somebody like Nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the Anti-Christ? Why are polluting the word of God to try and sell books and movies. Why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking? Do you think that the disciples, when Jesus ascended to heaven, thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation? No! Finally, you said that 2nd Corinthians 6:2 says: "TODAY is the day of salvation I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation." What bible version are you looking at. 2nd Corinthians 6:2 clearly states: "For he says, 'In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation." Nothing about Tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures!!! You are just making up Scripture, perverting the GOSPEL! Now verse 4 talks about troubles (lower-case "t"), hardships, distresses, etc. That is happening now, today until Jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of God to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period!!! Live today like it was your last day, because you could die or Jesus could come back (and believe me, you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent, secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years, I will continue to follow the God-breathed word of God and not fluff of Lahaye and Jenkins. "Tribulation" is found once in the bible (Rev 7:14 NIV) and it is with a lower-case "t" and has nothing to do about what the books suggest. "Rapture" never appears as this is a word that hasn't been around that long. So in summary, Jesus is coming back and we will know about it (whether you are a Christian or not). And off the subject, yes, baptism is essential to becoming a Christian and being saved (not praying Jesus into your heart)...it seems that the same people who believe in Lahaye's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well. Please do yourself a favor. Read the Bible and follow it. If you do that, then you won't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like J. Czecholinski who cannot even get his Scriptures straight!  Follow the teachings of God 
 I don't like propaganda. Take a look at Jerry Z. Muller's The Mind and the Market: Capitalism in Modern European Thought. It is apolitical, richly textured, tightly organized, and packed with ideas. If you are looking for the antecedents of the Industrial Revolution, read Maxine Berg's The Age of Manufactures 1700-1820 
 I thought this book was long, drawn out, and boring. It was too descriptive. To me, the writing style is a lot like Jane Eyre. I don't particularly like that type of book. Plus, it was way too sad and unrealistic. I don't think THAT many bad things could happen to one person 
 This book is not even up to the level of smear.  It is a shame that people could write such trash and make money off of smearing a good and honest man. Please do not wast your money and reward these political hacks 
 Cannot order these as they do not say what small, medium or large=....I have a 6 year olde and is 60#'s so do I buy a medium or a large...I hate this when I want  something and there is not enough information.. 
    The Jesuits run this country?!? And, according to one reviewer (with the poor spelling and the "PhD"), THAT'S why we have a priest/pedophilia problem?!? [Sigh]. Listen, instead of this pamphlet, read "The Secret Architecture of Our Nations Capital: The Freemasons and the Building of Washington, DC", a dense, information-packed piece of research that reflects all of the ten years the author poured into the meticulously documented work. Incontrovertibly, it offers PROOF VISIBLE TODAY for who founded this country (and not just it's capital), and not a trace of visible evidence exists that the founders were even mildly interested in the intellectual property of the likes of the Jesuits or ANY Catholic intellectuals. [In fact, whenever the Vatican tried to offer a piece of cut stone for the construction of the Washington Monument, along side a great many other countries, the denizens of DC hurled it into the Potomac.] This country was OPENLY antagonistic towards the Catholic Church, as every pre-schooler knows, and understandably so: the left-leaning doctrinaires on the back of our two-dollar bills thought the essential problem with the Old Country (which ever one that was) was the Catholic undercurrent that "kept" man in the Dark Ages and suspicious of Reason and Science and Intellectualism, the trinitarian gods of the Enlightenment. But who doesn't know this? The other reviewers of this book, apparently.      The author claims his family came into this country via Savannah--then he should know, as does every Georgian with at least an eighth-grade education [that's when you take Georgia History], that Oglethorpe, GA's founding pater, barred Catholics from settling in "his" colony, and, even if in the succeeding years the number of Catholics coming into GA (Savannah especially) made the law a dead letter, the colony--and eventual state--retained traces of it's anti-Catholic past.      But perhaps I'm wasting my time: The author of RULERS and its fawning reviewers have their "conspiracy", and in print, too, which means that it's "true".   
 This book is stacked with lore.  Nice for a light read, but if you are looking for a really useful book with practical information (and less superstition), pass this one by. 
 Good luck actually getting this item.  Delivery is a severe problem.  I have been back-ordered three times.  Latest estimate is 7 weeks after the order was placed.  Recommend you call your local bookstores for stock instead of relying on false delivery promises, especially if this is a gift.  
 In the world of modern Hollywood the Suspension of one's disbelief seems to be a critical skill.  However, no matter how highly honed one's "suspension" skills they are likely inadequate to carry a reader through this saga.  In 1939 Cavalry officer Slavomir Rawicz was arrested by the NKVD and taken to Moscow.  At Kharkob he was interrogated, tortured, and poorly fed before his trial. Afterwards Rawics is imprisoned in Lubyanka in Moscow where the torture continued.  Rawics, convinced that a confession would mean certain death, resists his captors.  Rawics is found guilty of spying and sentenced to 25 years of hard labor in a Siberian prison camp.  His journey to Irkutsk is a multi-week ordeal alongside thousands of others.  This journey involved a, a train car where men are packed so tightly that one cannot sit, followed by a multi-day hike at gunpoint across a snowy landscape to the location of camp 303.  Once there Rawic and other survivors are asked to build the camp from the ground up.  Pg 80+ or so  At this point I put the book down.  I could not longer suspend my disbelief.  With the assistance of Google it was not hard to discover that the veracity of the "The Long Walk" has long been in question.  It is also not difficult to find evidence that disproves, or at least seriously questions, much of what is claimed in this book ([...]).    However, hard evidence is not really needed unless a reader is in the market for a Bridge in Brooklyn.  Comic books are well written, but we all know that there is no man faster than a speeding bullet, and Rawics, in "The Long Walk" comes close to such imagery, by making an incredible journey, building his own prison, planning an escape in short order, and then an incredible escape that involved a 4000 miles journey across the Gobi dessert, across the Himalayas in the middle of winter, and a sighting of a Bumble.  Lucky for Yukon Cornelius - Bumbles bounce...oh sorry, getting confused.  This Story gets three stars, but minus 2 for the derogation of the publisher The Lyons Press.  There is no recorrd of camp 303, nor is there any record of Rawics seven compatriots Zygmunt Makowski, Anton Paluchowicz, Anastazi Kolemenos, Eugene Zaro, Zacharius Marchikovas, Smith, and a Polish women named Krystyna.  In short the publisher took the uncorroborated story of one man and pased it off as fact 
 This book is without value.  I thought I was going to learn a better way of communicating with my animal companions.  Instead I got nothing but New Age stories.  If you believe in New Age philosophy, you might want to read this.  If you're not a New Ager, don't waste your money.  I rate this book at minus 2 stars 
 I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.    After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?   There are other far better literary works.   
 I was really interested in the story, but the author wrote like  a 5th grader.  Every sentence seemed to be written in the same boring way. THis was a really brutal read which I couldnt finish.  
 ...where are the editors when you need them?...maybe this could have been a good 50 page book describing some difficult mathematical problems...as it stands it rambles on for two hundred plus pages with information that is shallow if you know a lot about math and incomprehensible if you don't...get it from the library 
 AND THAT IS BORING AND SNOBISH!  I watched the first two hours of this and coudn't keep awake.  The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!!  In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying "Check Please". 
 In my opinion, one would be hard pressed to find much of beauty here, or even of interest... Listen to clips, at least, before spending good money. Although perhaps beside the point, a good alternative is The Nine Horses project, featuring Sylvian, Jansen, Sakamoto and others 
  I purchased this book to read on a scuba diving trip in eastern Indonesia over Christmas and was very disappointed (I should have read the online reviews before I did).  While the subject matter is fascinating, and a large part of the narrative engaging, much too much time is spent by the author digressing into his often unrelated personal experiences during his travels around the world, name dropping those in his profession, inserting strained literary references and generally telling the reader endless amounts of useless information.  Admittedly, in Chapter 1 the Author tells the readers that "where my own experiences with people or places will serve to bring the process of investigation alive then I shall make diversions, the better to illuminate the way forward."  This sounds great in theory and a valid alternative to dry, impersonal prose.  The problem is that these many, many diversions provide no illumination at all on the subject matter (or the way forward), and they make much of the book read like a bad travelogue, with the author telling us he's in London or Oman or China or somewhere else and how fascinating or wonderful his trip is, such as a conference in Wales where we are told during a dinner he "sat next to a jolly professor of Celtic languages who explained the bardic tradition to me."  How does this possibly illuminate anything remotely related to natural history?  A few such diversions are tolerable or even folksy, but unfortunately they are never ending in this book.  In addition, the work suffers from an appalling lack of tables, maps, charts, diagrams and similar visual information that would help the reader better understand the subject matter.  Instead, the book contains pictures of such things as (and I'm not making this up) a row of slot machines in a Las Vegas casino and the tablecloth used during teatime by Lady Smith Woodward.  If you want a good book on the natural history of the Earth, keep shopping. 
 Apart from the section on Shannon, who is not covered well by others, I found very little to recommend this book. Much of the material is popularized elsewhere and Seife is not a compelling writer who can clarify concepts. I remain to be convinced that conceits equating the universe with a giant quantum computer really enhance our understanding of the universe, or its contents. Particularly as we still have no idea what 96% of the universe is made of (dark matter)!!! In essence, saying that information explains everything is rather like saying language is made up of words that have to be in specific patterns to make sense...a worthless tautology that sounds great but whose information content is zero. 
 The movie had so many ad's at the beginning, that you can't skip through, that my child was bored before the movie started. 
 This book is certainly heavy on the eye-candy - it has lots of great pictures (though perhaps dated... very late-80's hair styles) and nice listings describing the colleges and whatnot. If you're looking for something that gives a feel for the look of the place (or at least the look on nice early-summer days when all the students are wearing their gowns), this is a lovely place to look.  Unfortunately, glaring factual errors and odd 'stereotypes' really detracted from the quality of this guide. Included is a brief summary of the Oxford colleges. Unfortunately, many are left out (seemingly at random - the maps also leave out several important sites while including other entirely mundane ones) and the descriptions of others are factually quite incorrect (and sometimes contradictory - All Souls is described as being the only graduate college [it is not a graduate college], then Nuffield is also described as being a graduate college [it is]). There are also odd little tidbits of information that seem to represent a story of the colleges frozen sometime in the past (and not a nifty 1920's past - presumably the late 1980's or early '90's when the first edition was published) - 'excellent darts team?' ok, so they may have once, but that's rather useless information today. My own college's description, though quite pleasant, is not a very good representation of the place today. Some of the college descriptions are also really just mean, representing some undefined antipathy on the part of the author (did someone from that college steal his girlfriend or something?).  Overall, it's a very pretty publication that certainly had a very good team of photographers and graphic designers, but as it's not so strong on the facts and could do with some updates - Oxford isn't as unchanging as it may seem 
 This Biscotti is just awful, too sweet and too hard.  La Tempesta is a real Biscotti 
 If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot.  As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least.  I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day.  If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book "Improper English", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series 
 I've never read the Balzac novel this movie is based upon, but if Balzac wrote a coherent story, it didn't make it to the screen this time around.  The settings and costumes are glorious, leading one to expect somewhat high-brow entertainment, perhaps on the order of Merchant/Ivory.  Not to be.  A sophomoric joke repeatedly cropping up in the film is Elizabeth Shue's naked backside.  Huh?  Wouldn't the Gendarmes come running, in 1846 Paris?  Sacre Bleu!  None of these people are very nice, but they don't deserve the mischief Cousin Bette inflicts upon them.  And what is Jenny Cadine's motivation for letting herself be used in Bette's schemes.  Nothing makes sense, and the whole movie was just bad misfire.  Avoid if possible 
 I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to "radio control" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized.   If you need a "cable release," I strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera. It gives you 2-second and 10-second settings, and you're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time. 
 The plot is so contrived and the acting is just SO BAD.  My copy is in a landfill somewhere, right on top of Al Pacino's career 
 I purchased this book keeping in mind the depth of knowledge of Romila Thapar, but was extremely DISSAPOINTED.  The book completely underlights the Golden Period of India 800BC to 800AD and leaves off details like the discomfiture of Alexander (the Great :-0 ) and  many other really fantastic details that could have been included.  There is not much historic or literary value for this book.  Not th e right buy for studying the history of India 
 A few words to describe this book: vulgar, crude, and boring. I was truly excited to read this book when it was suggested to me. The idea of reading a sexual autobiography that was praised for not being another watered down censored bore, excited me. It only took me a totally of 50 pages to realize that I was stuck in the middle of someone's sexual nightmare.   The book is exactly what it is, a blurred recollection of someone's sexual history from roughly about 20 years prior to writing the book. So what's so amazing about a women's sex life that it should be an entire book? Well Catherine M. was not interested in conventional sex, she was involved in countless acts of group sex, orgies and sex clubs. Interesting right? Sadly, No. Catherine explains that her remembrances of these encounters are vague due to her ability to block out what is going on. Her memory is a blur of sexual activity. Parties, men, women, sex, sweat, faces, [...]is, kissing...it's all a confusing mess of events. The entire book is paragraph after paragraph of vulgar/crude descriptions of her involvement during each sexual act she tries to remember. It's not sexy/steamy or interesting. Though my boyfriend seemed to be really interested in reading how raunchy she can describe getting DPed while sucking some guy off. Catherine M. should stick to Art Reviews, not autobiographies 
 Chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist, is he begins with a typical theory: America is bad and all that it does is bad, finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together, and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme. Despite Chomsky's belief that Bin Laden's attacks were driven by US foreign policy, all one has to do is go to the source, whom Chomsky believes can be taken at his word, to realize the goals of Bin Laden.   All actions taken by Bin Laden and his organization have this specific and narrow goal: to re-create the Islamic Caliphate that existed centuries ago and basing it on Shari'a. It is driven by a chauvinistic belief that "Dar es Harb" does not deserve its prosperity and "Dar es Salam" deserves to take its rightful place of power on the world stage. Realistically, the only thing standing in the way of the recreation of the Caliphate is the United States and the force it can project to prevent this, and that's why Bin Laden believes it needs to be destroyed. One does not even have to stoop to Chomsky's level of vile intellectual dishonesty to make this point, Bin Laden's own words are very clear on this.   "the pious Caliphate will start from Afghanistan"  This is Bin Laden's reason for 9/11, everything else from the Palestinian issue to Iraq, to Saudi Arabia is a pile on to garner him mainstream support, but his core ideology a, Shari'a governed Islamic Caliphate, is what motivates his backers, allies. and foot soldiers.   Chomsky confidence that he understands everything that motivated Bin Laden, is more a projection of his own beliefs, ideology and motivations for wanting to see America destroyed than Bin Laden's motivations. Chomsky on September 11th is like someone who, upon hearing that Reagan was shot, immediately launches into a ten-minute tirade  about the Contras, Cuba, Palestine, Vietnam (etcetera), only to be told that was all about Jodie Foster.  His analysis, if that's what one could call this tripe, about Bin Laden also repeats the often told lie that Bin Laden was involved with the US during the 80's in Afghanistan. The Mujahideen were split into 6 different factions , three of which were hardliner Islamists : Islamic Party , Islamic society , Islamic Unity and three moderate factions : Islamic Revolutionary Movement , National Islamic Front , and National Liberation Front . None of these factions were led by Bin Laden and not all them were supplied by America, the hardliners were supplied by Pakistan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Don't believe it, look up Rober Fisk's interview with Bin Laden in 1988 where Bin Laden categorically denies that he took any assistance from the US during the Afghan Jihad.   If you want to know who Bin Laden is read Michael Scheuer, if you want to know what drives him, read Daniel Pipes, and if you want a poor alternative for toilet paper read Chomsky.  
 The success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people.  I was drawn to this book by it's title and central premise.  TOo bad Ben Sherwood can't write worth a lick.  I'm not sure which is more upsetting:  how poorly Ben Sherwood writes, or how low our expectations have fallen as readers, given the number of positive reviews this book has received.   
 As a feminist, I hate movies that portray women as victims who struggle futile against the big bad evil MAN.  There are no good men in this movie.  There are no evil women.   Such portrayals of women are demeaning.  We are human beings, just like men.  We are capable of evil.  Men are capable of good.  Yes, some men would turn their wives into robots if they could, but so would some women!  And I find it ridiculous that not one man stood up for his beloved partner.  I find it ridiculous that not one woman was capable of true evil.  Are we puppets?  It also bothers me that if these women are so strong and powerful, that they are helpless against the big bad men.  The message seems to be that we can't save ourselves.  We are just doomed to be what men want us to be.  I hate this attitude.  Men are not all powerful.  Women are human beings, not saints.    Two stars, though, for capturing the fears of women everywhere 
 This book was used in part, for a class on the in Classics on the Age of Homer.  This book describes early Greek life and culture in depth, yet at the same time seemed to be way over my head.  The text is very longwinded and confusing for someone who has not met the material before, and would not recommend it as a book to read in your pasttime.  Rather, the book is very thorough, and would make for great refernce material, giving an in depth perspective to  early Greek culture 
 Would rate at no stars if possible. First one failed after 7 months, would not hold charge. It was replaced under warranty; the replacement failed after 8 months, again, would not hold charge. Customer Service said to send in for repair, no estimate of how long I'd be without a razor. My response is "forget it." Braun, here I come 
 I've read 2 other Walter Mosley's and that's it for me. He's too sloooow and most of all  empty. He's character are not very interesting and the stories always lag, drag and fizzz out. I don't see how the reviewers see  Walter Mosley as a black writer with something  powerful to say about the  black condition/experience etc. He hasn't said anything, let  alone  anything profound. In fact he doesn't even scratch the service.  He should  be  writing kids books because that is where his composing skills have  remained. Snails  think faster than Walter Mosley 
 I should have listened to the reviews.  Within 15 minutes I was so angry with this joystick I pitched it into the trash.  I'm a Mac user and it didn't work for me at all.  No matter what game I played, it kept moving characters backwards even when I wasn't touching it.  Calibration is terrible.  Do not take a chance with this one, I did, I lost 
 "The myths in this collection use their Roman names..." -Quoted from page 71 of book.  Um...why does this book use Roman names if it is supposed to be a collection of Greek Myths?  Very confused.  I think that "D'aulaire's Book of Greek Myths" is a better book of the same caliber.  
 Nothing more than paranoid conspiracy theorist ramblings.  Poorly written, providing no verifiable supporting evidence.  If this vast conspiracy reached so far and resulted in the "accidental deaths" of so many people who knew too much, then how exactly was Al Martin able to write and publish this book without ending up in a shallow grave next to Jimmy Hoffa 
 PROS:  Makes a quick cup of coffee. CONS: I went through two of these.  Very cheap and breaks easily.  I'm finding the specialty pods- Skinny Latte & Cappuccino, hard to come buy.  Usually the ones I find on the store shelves are expired.   If you really want a Black & Decker Home Cafe, get the newer model-  GT300 Home Café.   *Note: I also owned one of those Senseo coffee makers.  It would consistently dispense the wrong amount of water resulting in numerous overfills therefore wasting numerous coffee pods, so more expensive isn't always better 
 This book is written by Sonia on how great Sonia is. If you are looking for a step by step instruction on how to do your makeup...this is not the book for you 
 I am not a John Wayne fan, and believe other reviewers who have pointed out the inaccuracies in 'Flying Tigers', but I'd like to have the DVD just to take me back to a time (1942) when, at the age of six, I was left with a friend in the United Artists theater on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, to watch my very first movies - this one, and 'Bambi'.  I entered that movie house a dedicated, blood-thirsty fan of blowing enemy folks to bits, and left horrified by having repeatedly watched pilots get their faces shot off behind broken canopy glass.  I had not realized there was so much bleeding in war, and that death might actually happen. Upon returning home, I told my mother, who would die, of TB, the following year, that I had become a pacifist.  'Uh huh'. she replied, knowing well my sanguinary inclinations. Of course, she was right - before very long, I was happily imagining myself flying a B-17 and creating firestorms all over Europe.  This is a VERY good movie for young children to see 
 One of the things a prudent business owner should seek to avoid when adding to the library are books that are the same garbage they've already read somewhere else. This book is a quick and dirty version of several other author's materials, rehashed and reworded, with some quotes from people who aren't high on the list of those one would want to emulate. Plus, anyone that quotes Nancy Langdon Jones on the first page as an "expert" on how to build a successful practice cannot be taken seriously. Dick Koreto has never been a financial planner, nor has he been a successful business owner. His selection of so-called "experts" shows how little he really knows about what it takes to survive and thrive in the craft of advice. Save your money and time, and keep browsing for more suitable material 
 Very disappointing.  I only bought it because I found Ringo's 4-volume "trilogy" on the Posleen wars engaging with interesting characters.   This book does not measure up. It starts with lots of clunky expository dialogue, then goes on to a tedious, way too long set up. After 164 pages, after you've followed the tiresomely cliched characters around for a lot of totally irrelevant and uninteresting non-events, when you're wondering for the tenth time if the story is ever going to start and which of these cardboard cut-outs you're supposed to care about (you never come to care about any of them) there's a betrayal (finally, some action!) for what turns out to be a totally uninteresting motive, followed by a long tedious stalk (here we go again) and frustrating out of character behavior of the survivors: A master sniper can't find a wounded guy who's crawled a few meters into the bush? Doesn't even try? When he obviously needs to leave no one alive?  And where was the Darhel's vaunted "Sense" while the murder was being planned? Then we're told Darhel can go a week sans rest without too much trouble but he's so worn out after three days he can't take the opportunity of the bad guy falling asleep to move? He exposes himself to fire to begin some great plan then two pages later is again wondering what to do next?   Don't hold your breath waiting for him to do anything to justify the book's title.  You'll be horribly disappointed. Then we find jarring contradictory details like "the hero" still being tracked several pages after he's discovered and ditched the tracking device. etc. etc. etc... The final fate of the bad guy is straight "god out of the box". Come on! I won't reveal what it was in case some masochist wants to slog through the long tedium for it but it made me want to hurl the book across the room. Or just hurl.  And the denoument is laughable.  Think of the old "Kung Fu" TV serious.  "Well done, grasshopper...." My bet is Ringo had very minority input on this.   Note to Baen: Crap is crap no matter whose name is on it 
 This video copy of this movie was one of the worst I have ever purchased. The DVD would play for about a minute then freeze up. I could not enjoy the movie. After complaining about the poor quality of the movie I was granted a refund but still lost out on the shipping cost. The movie is listed as Language English but the copy that I rceieve was in Mandarin or chinese. Very dissapointing 
 I found the book to be extremely wordy.  As I read the book, I found myself having to remind myself what the chapter (or topic) was suppose to be covering.  Many of the statements in the book are common sense and points are repeated over and over through-out the text. The books is loaded with long list consisting of from 4-12 items.  The list appear to be attempts by the authors to include every possible idea they could think of.  My Professor used the questions from the test bank and many of the answers were buried in the readings.   	The cases studies were interesting, and the information on the website helps with the case analysis.  Although after reading one of the chapters, any reading was interesting.  Reading this book became a chore.  If the book is required for class, start reading now because the way the book is written will make you procrastinate 
 A lover's betrayal. . . A killer on the loose. . .   Eve Duncan was actually happy. She had a man who loved her, an adoptive daughter as great as her own, and her dead daughter's bones were found and safely buried. But then a letter in the mail opens her eyes to a secret her boyfriend, Joe Quinn, kept for two full years. Now she wants away from him, and when a job opportunity in a different state presents itself, she packs her bags and leaves. On her first night in Louisiana, someone tries to kill her, and they won't give up until she's dead! Will she uncover the secret in time? Or will death silence her?  When I picked up this book I wasn't surprised it got high on every bestsellers list. It was moving a mile a minute and between the hired assassins, secrets, deaths, and conspiracies, I knew I was reading a great novel. And then, after chapter 5, the book came to a stop and decided to creep at turtle speed. The character of Eve Duncan became uncharacteristically naive and immature, while her 12 year old adoptive daughter Jane was acting like a 50 year old, smart and mature beyond her years. The book dragged all until chapter 12. Once chapter 12 begins, the book takes flight once again and the bombs (literally) start going off. The ending was good and though I thought it was predictable, it was still somewhat enjoyable. It wasn't as good as the first two books in that series, but it was better then the third. 
 Edward Hirsch has written a meticulous analysis of the art of poetry, imbued with an authentic love of the form. From page to page he dissects and interprets; his enthusiasm remains high throughout. Not just the poetry, but also the poets themselves are lavished with heroic praise, their craft transcending the mortal. Their words are golden strands of virtue more appropriately whispered into the ears of gods.  But, but...  For those of us uneducated in the art of poetry there is a much more basic level of understanding that has to be achieved first: Why no punctuation? Why do sentences break in mid-breath? How does one find the meter in a poem? How does one read poetry without the stops and starts from line to line? Perhaps we should have learned this in school, but we didn't, so we bought this book.  This is a good book, really, but it is not what its title suggests. It should rather be entitled "The Love of Poetry", or "Falling in Love With Poetry", or "Furthering Your Love of Poetry", or something else emotive. "How to Read a Poem" sounds mechanical, the basics, just what those uneducated among us get when we do a keyword search on how to read a poem.  Select another book in order to learn how to read a poem, then graduate to this one once you comprehend the basics. 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!  Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.  First things first, the Lovers- Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end. Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is  shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.  Next we have the plot- As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how "sweet" and "fine" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.   My Opinion- The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless "Yes", "No"s, and "All right"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers 
 From the above title, I thought I was ordering a set of 4 mugs.  Howver, when the order arrived, there was only 1 mug.  
 Linda Ashcroft crafted a well-written book of fiction. The dates she claims to have been with Morrison have been publicly proven as inaccurate. She was sued by the Morrison family when the book was first published in Europe and she lost the case, 3/4ths of her advance money and the book was pulled from the shelves. When the book was edited and published in the US, it was proven she did not know Jim and she again lost her advance money and her publishing company canceled her book tour and refused to do any promotion. It would be a great book if she just published it for what it is...fiction. 
 I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it.  Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release 
 This book is inviting Muslim women who presently believe;  God  transcends sexes(ontologically different cathegories); sexes are for the created Man and woman are created from the same selves (ontological equality) A woman can stand up in a mosque and remind the caliph his duties (and the caliph says "she is right and I am wrong")  To another faith which believes;  God is male (a father) that gives birth to a God-son (another male).However the worldly birth is by a human-woman. Man is the primary creation and the woman secondary A woman cannot talk in a church but can ask her husband later  With an art finding its roots in sophists who openly said: "our art is one of showing the small big and the big small"  As a proverb in my country says "a mighty arguing thief can overcome the houseowner". Something like that.  Do not forget many ex-christian western people came to the realization that  the basis of all inequality is due to a MALE God. The troubles about women's issues are ontological in Christianity and the accusations -which I disagree with most but agree with some- on Islam are in level of law or tradition. Former unsolvable, latter something can be done about if people intend to.  Indeed Muslim scholars are very expertly critical of their hadith collections from the earliest days of their existence. This criticism finds its roots inside Islam:Quran is divinely preserved, Allah said so  but Allah did not say such a thing about the sayings of the prophet so noone can say hadith collections are perfect.How much ever you try you may not be able to escape human errors in them. This is most beautifully and very briefly summarized in Murad W. Hofmann's Islam in 3rd Millenium in a constructive way.   Also one wonders if crescent is a shadow and Christ is light are they not equally shadow and equally light for Muslim men? Is this a trick of (conceptually) "divide and destroy"? As we well know Evangelists care less whether we Muslims become Christians or not but basically want to diminish the resistance of Islam to Anglo Saxon/Jewish hegemony which we Muslims mostly find unjust.     The impressionn that the authors have been brought by  a muslim cleric father is misleading. Their mother was not Muslim- she was Swedish though I donno if she truly practised Christianity. Due to difficulties in family at an early age they have been taken by Evangelic Christians and they have learnt Islam Evangelic Christian way.By people who HAVE TO look all other  religions as founded by Devil in order to exist. And have to interpret everything according to this basis.If you want to know how the basis you accept changes interpretation than a cow is a god in India, something you fight with in Spain, beef steak in North America etc.I have seen books Christians try to show Buddha's light is from Devil or Hinduism's mystical experience is so too. Wheras Islam  sees other religions as teachings of prophets corrupted by time and people and yet still carries something precious in them. Quran says Allah gave compassion to Christians' hearts.I believe this was what Caner brothers faced when they met Evangelists.   
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 Not as expected. Does not give off enough lite to read cook books. Appears to be strictly decorative 
 I've always enjoyed Sara Paretsky's novels, despite the left-wing preaching. In the past this has been subordinated to character & plot. But not here. There's not much plot -- a few elements here & there -- & it never really drives the story. Far too much space is given to the standard left-wing caricature of the rich & the repetitive, boring stereotyping of 'family values' as just so much plutocratic hypocrisy. Ms Paretsky, we _know_ you hate the American rich, & they're probably as hideous as you paint them to be. But here they're just cardboard cut-out characters. And of course the book is just a long, boring wait to see just how the filthy rich committed the crime & how they'll get away with it. Plus the satisfying way in which the horrible rich are (once again) forced to cough up the money they at first (of course) refused to give. This is getting tedious. 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I really wanted to like this book, but was immediately put off by Lisa's "holy-roller" mother trying to get Catholic girl Amy to sign a "statement of faith" to assure her salvation. Yikes!!  I could see where an ill-informed fundamentalist character would do this, but shame on "Amy" for leaving her Catholic roots and joining a "mega-church".  She could have found a deeper faith in the ancient Church instead of leaving it on what appears to be a whim!  After this, it was hard to like her character...I'm sure that the evangelical publisher would not have liked a main character remaining Catholic, but, sorry to inform some of you, it's the same Jesus that died on the Cross that we believe in too. We also worship the risen Christ, most just choose to display a Christ on the Cross as a reminder of how we got our redemption!  Robin, write a sequel where Amy gets involved in the Charismatic Catholic Renewel and that will re-establish her as a true French girl and a faith-filled Christian!  
 Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text.  This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read.  I lost attention, and attentiveness.  My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone.  If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary 
 It's hard to give an objective review, as I didn't get the PCB Board with this book. I emailed McGraw-Hill, going to see why it didn't have one.  If I can't get any help there, I'm going to contact Amazon about this....  Update:  I got a response back from McGraw-Hill, these are no longer going to come packed with a PCB board.  They said something about a CDRom, but I didn't get one with my book. This is really uncool, as most of the experiments are predicated on having that PCB.  So, I would urge anyone who was really considering this to perform the experiments to pass it up.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 How absolutely assinine this book could get at times is beyond me....to quote the Bible like some fundamentalist zealot, claiming GOD made/caused a better deal on an Oldsmobile rather than a PT Cruiser is childish drivel and not worthy of publication.  If fundamentalists would spend MORE time helping out fellow mankind than attributing serendipitous coincidences of daily life to some mystical "God" intervention, the world would be a better place to live.  Save your money---go put your religion to work and volunteer to help feed the homeless or a family in need and give them the money you'd have spent on this book.  Sheesh! How embarrassing for women in general 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book.  The only thing this book gave me was the notion that action makes everything happen.  Trouble is, I already knew that, and I bought the book to learn more about it, and perhaps gain new insights to enhance my life's actions.   It seems Ringer has patched together a bunch of disparate ideas which are all supposed to be related to "action", but really they are just conventional wisdom forced to fit what his book is (supposed to be) about.  A perfect example is his chapter "People Taxes and Action".  He talks about all sort of "people taxes" (people who tax your ability to act), such as "The Evilness Tax" (evil people), "The Dishonesty Tax" (dishonest people), and "The Negativism Tax" (negative people).  The conventional wisdom he offers is basically this: avoid evil, dishonest, and negative people, as they will get in the way of your ability to act.  I found this chapter, and the book in general, trite and patronizing.  This book was not even close to what I expected based on the reviews I read before buying it.  I am suspicious of all the glowingly positive reviews about this book.  My strong recommendation is to leaf through it in a bookstore or library before you buy it, to make sure it is what you are expecting.  I sure wish I had

 This CD should be named "Songs That Never Made It". Except for 2 tracks (Jump and Heavan Knows),which are available on other volumes, the songs on this CD are all unknowns for a very good reason. It would be  interesting to know the names of the DJ's who thought these were their  "Favorite Pix" 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 The Contortionist's Handbook, Craig Clevenger's first novel, is a weird, complicated, seemingly pointless exercise in futility.  The novel follows John Dolan, who is known by many other names throughout the book, because that is what he does, he changes his identity, and others, with great expertise and perfection.  We are introduced to John when he wakes up from a headache that he refers to as a "godsplitter" in a hospital, and he is forced to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he is suicidal or depressed.  From that point, the novel divides its time between the interview between John and the Evaluator and giving us John's life story, which is remarkably uninteresting for such a weird tale.  The thing that gets me about this book is that it seemingly has no point.  I guess one could say its point to be "anti-psychiatry," but forgive me for asking that the author also include somewhat of a plot to at least make the story interesting.  The only interesting and entertaining part of the novel is the interaction between John and the Evaluator.  But, for some reason, Clevenger decides that John's life story is more important, even though we are only given a brief, fleeting glimpse into a life that seems to be much more complicated than the author wanted to put into the novel.  Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining about the novel's length, because I don't think I would have finished it if it was longer than it already is.    I also read Clevenger's second novel, Dermaphoria, a while ago, and while I didn't really enjoy it, the novel at least had some semblance of a story that made it worth reading.  As this novel grew closer and closer to ending, I slowly realized that there was no way that any meaning was going to be given to the convoluted story within the last 20 pages.  Clevenger tries to inject some suspense into the story near the end, but he ends up just using underdeveloped characters to do things that we have no idea what their motivation is for doing.  I think that Clevenger could be a good writer, but, dear Lord, he needs to try writing a "normal" novel, until I read about one of his novels, and it isn't about a drugged out freak or a mentally unstable counterfeiter, I think that I am pretty much done giving his novels the benefit of the doubt 
 The early part of the book was pure Ludlum, good opening, strong plot buildup, etc. The second quarter went off on a tangent of the spy hero suddenly meeting up with another spy, an old female flame, and yet another spy, a British tongue-in-cheek type.   This was followed by paragraph after paragraph of what they all once meant to each other, ad nauseam.....gaaaaaagggg. The whole story took a new direction possibly aimed at getting women to read spy thrillers.   I don't know. I don't care. The unread remains of this trivial pursuit spy scam lies buried in a wastepaper basket somewhere in my house waiting for next week's trash collection. I'm just glad I bought it second-hand. 
 I think it is tragic that such an excellent intstrumental performance should be marred by some very unpleasant vocalizing. I can't understand why so many fans take it for granted. I would rate Keith Jarrett very high as a pianist; in the same league as Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea; if only he could keep his mouth shut while he plays his pianistic miracle 
 If you believe that all men are out to get you, if you believe that all men are potential rapists, or if you believe that sex is a weapon men use to opress women, then this is the book for you! I imagine you will read the book while looking tentatively over your shoulder, fearing some evil man may pass by.  I always weigh every book I read objectively, trying to find a balance and see both sides of the argument. However, Andrea Dworkin makes this an impossible task for any sensible and rational person.  Even a cursory inspection of this book will make it a glaring certainty that the themes here are paranoia, hate, and fear. If you believe the psychotic rantings of Andrea Dworkin, all men hate all women (this isn't a negotiable idea), and sex couldn't possibly be an act that a woman might consensually enjoy with a man. No, if you believe the ravings of this madwoman, all men are rapists that use sex to "keep women in their place". No woman ever "really" wants to have sex with a man. But, alas, women are forced to have sex with men. And if a man ever sees a woman experiencing happiness, he immediately devises a way to rob her of it. Give me a break.  If you enjoy or agree with these kind of theories, don't have a penis, or are lacking common sense, then you will love this book.  It's funny how Andrea Dworkin preaches (high and blind in her lunatic ivory tower) about the need for a woman to control her own life, yet goes on to tell women that they cannot be happy with a man or enjoy sex with one, which takes away the exact choice she rages about. One thing she professes, in no uncertain terms, is that if you're a woman that does not agree with her, then you are a detriment to all woman. In the real world, we call people like her dictators.  Even more irritating than her inane diatribes, is her complete and total lack of credible evidence or argument. There are no facts, only paranoid opinions. Andrea Dworkin truly believes that the whole of the male species is out to get her.  What's really disheartening about all this is that there are so many women fighting for true equality (and not the complete subjugation men). Unfortunately, paranoia is contagious, and a few other women have turned to this sort of radical feminism. Studies have shown, time and again, that the vast majority of these radical feminists have been either raped or molested at some point in their lives. So it's safe to say that these women are extremely biased, provide no evidence of any kind, and make up blatant lies to support their "cause". And yet they purport to speak for all women. It's clear that these women, just like Andrea Dworkin, are the real detriment to women everywhere.  But I'm not worried. Most women, like myself, still love men, and will continue to ignore the ravings of the lunatic fringe. And that makes the radicals madder than anything.  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life reading this ridiculous drivel 
 This book is awful. Crump repeatedly takes unfounded shots at Christians and Clergymen. Eventually I had to give up on the book, it became intolerable.   The rest of the content was mediocre at best. He made very little effort to keep the reader interested. It read more like a lecture from a dull professor. This is not due to my lack of interest in the subject; I'm a 3rd year physics student. Thomas Crump just managed to suck and blow while writing this book. His insulting attitude towards Christianity didn't help. 
 This book twists facts and constantly points the finger at the 'massa' letting down the poor. White men are said to be in a position of leadership out of 'accident of birth'. She tells us not to make, snicker, of stand for racial jokes. Then in the next chapter she tells one of her own in support of black pride. This book is absolutely riddled with contradictions. She feels it is the responsibility of you and I, through government to pay enough taxes so that there are no poor families in America. She writes that one should not feel 'entitled' to anything they didnt 'sweat' and 'work for'. Then says 'we' should 'give' to the poor instead of buying more things for ourselves. This book is absolutely ridiculous. If a white man wrote a book like this it would be dismissed as racist garbage.  
 Reading this book, I didn't expect much, given that every book Black Flame has put out for Freddy and for Jason has pretty much been awful.  However, I decided to give this one a chance, with a fresh set of characters, and an interesting new idea with the Trancebox dream machine.  However, soon after starting this book, I found that the dream kills, while unique, were very repetitive, with several characters dreaming the same dream over and over and over.  It got really boring toward the middle of the book, and there was next to no suspense surrounding Freddy.  It was all centered around the Trancebox, which is a rip-off of The Riddler's dream machine from "Batman Forever".  Don't believe me?  Go watch the movie once.  In the end, I was glad some of the characters met their demise.  Most of them were annoying, and none were even the slightest bit interesting.  The author had no grasp on the character of Freddy Krueger.  He was portrayed too much as a comedian instead of the dementedly sick slasher he truly is.  In fact, aside from Wes Craven, I don't think any director or author has ever really been able to get that right.  The bottom line here is, avoid this book at all costs.  Just like every other Freddy book, I found it dull, boring and definitely not worth the money I wasted on it.  I'd give it a zero rating, but Amazon.com says I have to at least give it a 1, so that's what I'm stuck with 
 I picked up this book when it was first published. Since there are so few books on the subject, any new book is a welcome addition.  That is, until you actually read it. I've had college textbooks that were more fun to read.  Apparently, this title sells very well.  Perhaps it's the curtain on the cover or the whimsical thought bubbles that lead people to believe the secrets of directing are within this book.  If you want a book on directing that is uninspiring, lifeless, and an all-around chore to read, this is your book.  If you're still looking for the straight-forward approach to directing you thought would be within this book, "A Sense of Direction" by William Ball will ultimately be more helpful 
 I have been a Neil Young fan for decades.  Like many others my age, I cut my teeth on his music, followed him into his electric phase, and bought and learned to play just about everything he recorded.    This album is tired.  Its the same old licks you've heard before and, whether you agree with his politics or not, his lyrics just don't have the sharp edge that they once did.  He has written so many compelling songs with strong social or political messages in his time (Ohio, Zuma, Rockin' in the Free World).  He stands in a small group of musicians that can claim to be among the most influential of our time.    So, given that I think so highly of him, let me say that I wish he hadn't recorded this album and I am sorry I bought it.  
 The commericial for this doll shows her swimming in water.  Now I wasn't crazy enough to believe that it could actually swim, but I did think the doll could be placed in water.  NOT!!111  My daughter was very disappointed that she couldn't play with it in the bath tub.  Also the dolls singing is annoying, you can't understand what she's saying 
 Examples are few and offer little explaination. I find this book so hard to follow.  On a good note: algorithms are clear 
 In fourth grade we were read this book by our teacher, after lunch (!) for about 2 weeks. I really think this had everything to do with my now phobia of worms, which sounds stupid and a little crazy but believe me not a mild problem when it rains. Thanks, Thomas Rockwell and Miss Maroon, the nightmares continue!  (I gave it one star reluctantly because the review wouldn't post with no stars selected) 
 However it doesn't work as well as my previous one from Pavoni. The cover on the Capresso fits around the outside of the grinder so when you transfer the ground coffee to another container there is always some cleanup required. It also takes longer to get the beans finely ground. 
 This novel is neither a love story nor a story about Titanic. Don't be misled if that's why you want to read this story. What it is, is the tale of a 12 year old boy struggling with the confusing and conflicting feelings which the onset of puberty brings. Unfortunately, this is a poor choice of narrator for a tale of the tragic ship. Sumner Jordan, is so wrapped up in his own feelings and fantasy love story, the object of his affection is a 21 year-old suffragist, that he is neither observant about his surroundings, nor perceptive about the feelings of the famous and fictional characters he meets. Worse, he complains about everything. So much so that when he is going through his crises, instead of feeling sympathy, you just wish he'd deal with it and keep quiet. Sumner is also hard to believe as a 12 year-old boy. Especially at the beginning of the book, the voice is more that of a girl.  A major problem with the story is the lack of character development. You never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care about their fates. During the sinking, the life and death decisions are made so quickly, little suspense is generated. If you collect Titanic literature, by all means, add this to your collection. If you are looking for greater insight into the disaster, look somewhere else

  In the first line of his 1971 work, Eduardo Galeano clearly states, "the division of labor among nations is that some specialize in winning and others in losing." (Page 1)  For Galeano, the economic well being of the United States and Europe rested on the back of Latin America.  First pillaged for its gold and silver, then for it's human resources, Latin America served as the foundation for capitalist interests.  This is the thesis for the book, and the author spends over 300 pages expounding on the "horrors" and "injustices" that the western world has plagued on Latin America.  "Latin America's industry," the author writes, "lies at the bottom of the Imperium's digestive apparatus.  Our union makes their strength to the extent that our countries, not having broken from the molds of underdevelopment and dependence, integrate their own respective serfdoms." (Page 254)  This, according to Galeano, resulted in the dividing up of Latin America's population into disjointed nation states, as each section of the countryside was developed to capitalize on one resource.  "Today," Galeano writes, "any of the multinational corporations operate with more coherence and sense of unity than the congeries of islands that is Latin America." (Page 260)      In presenting his argument Galeano divides his book into three parts.  Mankind's Poverty as a Consequence of the Wealth of the Land, Development Is A Voyage With More Shipwrecks Than Navigators, and an update to the original work added in 1977 simply titled, Seven Years After.  Unfortunately Galeano provides a very one-sided overview of Latin American history from the time of Columbus to the late 1960s.  Within the first section's three chapters, the author paints a greed driven picture of Spanish explorers bent on finding gold at all cost, followed by European, and then American exploiters, manipulating the sugar and coffee industry for their own gains at the cost of the native peoples.  While spending a large amount of text in describing the first Spanish expeditions, Galeano neglects to mention the then current situation among the Native American Indians.  He never mentions the ambiguous relationships that certain Indian cultures had with their own neighbors, or the fact that the Aztecs were oppressing their own people.  No mention is given at all to the fact that Cortes had help from neighboring tribes in the overthrow of the Aztec Empire. The Indians are portrayed as simple peace loving people.      Galeano also seems to make assumptions that do not stand the test of time.  In writing about the Spanish-American War and the acquisition of Puerto Rico the author states, "at the same time the Philippines and Puerto Rico dropped into the United States' lap." (Page 71)  He then goes on to expound, in a footnote almost half the page long, the horrors the people of Puerto Rico have faced (no say in Congress, trade controlled, Puerto Ricans drafted to fight in Vietnam) as a "colony" of the United States.  He fails to point out, and as time has shown, that since the late 1970s Puerto Rico has been given the choice of either remaining the way they are, becoming independent, or becoming the 51st state.  Although the margin is narrowing with every election they have always chosen to remain a commonwealth (My second wife was of Puerto Rican decent with family still living on the island.  A heated debate over this issue always ensued as most of her family did not want to see Puerto Rico gain independence or statehood because it would affect their property holdings on the island.  This, I later discovered, was the position most Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. but owning property on the island held).  In Galeano's defense one can argue that this was not the case in 1970 when he had written the book, but as the work had been updated in 1977, and a 25th Anniversary Edition was published in 1997, this fact could have easily been added.      Another case-in-point is the author's examination of Cuba, and the effects that the sugar industry has had on that nation.  While one is not arguing with his take that the "fate of the `sugar islands' to be incorporated one by one into the world market...condemned [them to produce] sugar until our day," (Page 65) has had an adverse affect on the economies of these nations, his ideological look towards the Castro revolution seems a little off base.  "Cuba," Galeano writes, "continues to depend on the sale of sugar, although the agrarian reforms of 1959 sparked an intensive diversification of the economy." (Page 65)  For Galeano, the throwing off of American interests has allowed the Cuban economy to expand, thus ending seasonal unemployment and allowing Cubans to work beyond the "five or so months of the sugar harvest, but for twelve months in the continuous job of building a new society." (Page 65)  What Galeano fails to have foreseen, is that in the 30 odds years since he penned this work, Cuba, which has had no influence from the United States, and trades freely with most of the outside world (a source of Cuban cigars from Canada flows steadily into the United States), is still one of the poorest nations in Latin America.  Castro's great social revolution, even with billions of Soviet dollars poured into the country, has failed to raise the living standard of the average person, and Cuba remains one of the poorest nations in the region.      It is clear that Galeano failed to look at both sides of the issue, and fell into the trap many who study history fall into: judging historical events by late 20th century standards.  The Spanish did not leave their shores with the expressed intent of destroying Latin American culture, nor did the concept of accepting native religions even occur to them.  The view of the world of 1500 was a very narrow one, where the Church ruled and if you did not follow their example then you were a pagan, ripe for conversion. To the Spanish, and later British and Americans, Latin America was a resource to exploit while bringing "civilization" to this region of the world.  Yes, it is true that imposing European ideals and customs on the natives destroyed their culture, just as it is true that imposing the Requerimiento, the telling of native peoples that if they did not accept Christ as their savior, then the Church would sanction the enslavement and exploitation of their cultures, was calculated and brutal. These acts however, were not a distinctly European invention, although reading Galeano would make one think it was.  While raking-over-the-coals European and American involvement in the region, the author fails to mention the same conditions embarked upon by non-whites, like West African nation's participation in the slave trade, the Japanese slaughter of Chinese nationals, and in our own part of the world, (as I have already pointed out), the Aztec civilization being an oppressive culture, whose empire was built on the labor of conquered peoples also.

 You will still need either a good book or a friend to help you figure out how to hold the pen and make the letters.  This is just a kit w/ paper and pens and the pens weren't even that great.  No matter how you write they don't make lines that transition between fat and thin.  Might as well use a regular pen... I am kinda dissapointed and will keep looking for better pens.   I give it 2 stars for dollar value.  
 Common sense tells us that who would know more about a product then it's inventors. Who whould be better to teach us about that product then the inventors. Well Microsoft has not and does not believe in common sense. you rely on this book to pass the test or to know anything pratical about Server 2000 and buddy you're in for a world of hurt. It leaves out significant details and aspects of server 200 that are need for a complete understanding of server 2000. Yes, what little detail and knowledge it prvides are accurate, but they are so few. Old Billy Gates again with a half attempt like everything he does. It seems their idea of common sense is: Well we charge $135 a test and sell the book for $45 and since they'll never pass the test on the first or second try then we'll make a bundle. Save your money and save your time. Buy the Sybex book for preparation for the test 
 It took me a little while to get through this anticlimactic book!  The only redeeming quality was the setting, a tropical island.  The story left nothing to the imagination, it was totally predictable and each chapter gave the views of every character.  When you know where everyone is at every moment, there's no mystery.  It's a very predictable story that did not keep me on the edge of my seat 
 Speaking clearly from experience, and perhaps even from a wearied condition, Gordon MacDonald does a thorough job of identifying various kinds of habits, individuals, attitudes, and situations which are prone to drain us of spiritual passion, or quite likely of any passion whatsoever.  In fact he does so thorough a job that the men in my Bible study class began to question whether the book would do much more than define the problem.  MacDonald does offer some wise counsel after a clear transition from "problem" to "solution" is made on page 119:  "After all of this discussion about weariness and passionlessness, is there anything positive to say?  Are there principles and truths that, when properly applied, permit one to put the inner, and even the outer, life back into form in much the same way as we realign the pool balls at the beginning of a game?"  At this point the book does begin to outline the sorts of practices and relationships that help a person recharge.  Reservations expressed in class had to do with labeling people as "the very draining people", "the very important people", "the very nice people", etc. and advocating the need to recognize people as such so we can appropriately tailor our responses.  Students questioned the wisdom here and doubted whether the "normal Christian life" is truly intended to always exhibit passion.  Several cited examples of people like Paul, Elijah, Job, Jonah, etc. who seemed utterly despondent at times.  Another reservation had to do with the relative lack of scripture references as the foundation for the specific points being made and for the book as a whole.  Some of MacDonald's other works come highly recommended and may be better starting points for those who are not familiar with his writing 
 I should know better than to buy books with arbitrary numbers in the title;  "101 this," "60 days to that," "10 simple whatever."  How many mistakes did the authors really think of and how long did it take them to pad out the number to reach 101?  All that aside, this book reads like a PowerPoint presentation and with a good speaker it might be a really good one, but it doesn't make for compelling reading material.  After 30 pages I was just scanning the bullet points.  The information and advice is valid (for the most part) but there just isn't enough of it here to justify a book 
 I have read other novels by Dorothea Frank, and I wasn't expecting too much- only interesting characters and a reasonably interesting plot.  The book was horrible.  While it did have the usual low country setting, the plot was awful.  The book was written in first person with the narrator being Grace, a travel agent who could not even ask her Italian-Catholic parents to include her boyfriend in their family gatherings. Her spineless mother, who couldn't stand up to her husband, and who was a slave to her own mother, supposedly had some deep secret reason for her doormat behavior, however that aspect was not even explored. Most annoying to me was the Catholic miracle aspect.  Perhaps Frank ought to reconsider writing novels and write sales material for holy water and religious statues 
 I was really hopeful about this product working.  I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8.  I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button.  They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it 
 Hackneyed, boring, predictable. I'm a bit surprised by the positive reviews of this lame flick. Sal's acting rings false, but the guy sure had charisma and looks. Particulary his well-shaped mouth. I actually found his "drumming" far more convincing than his singing, though he moves so quickly, who can say whether he's hitting the snare or the cymbal at the same moment you're hearing those sounds?  Anita O'day's too-brief moment in this film was a tragic lapse of judgement on the part of all involved with the making of this movie. She is the most authentic thing going for this film. Why they kept her in the background in her only scene is a mystery--the woman emanates jazz and her own unique brand of sex appeal 
 Not only are the things listed in this book cheap trinkets but most everything in the book you have to pay $1.00 or $2.00 for. The stuff you do not have to pay shipping for are useless pamphlets and literature. There are a few things that are pretty cool and possibly some useful information for some folks but most everything is Junk. Plus a lot of the things listed are repeated through the book. Its like the author needed to add stuff and thought nobody would notice that several of the things were repeated. Overall this 31 page booklet was not worth the paper it was printed on. If you are interested in getting free things I would suggest finding "freebie" message boards on the internet 
 What a waste of time. This was like sitting through a very boring business course. I was never interested in turning the page. I would have liked to see more of Carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story.Instead I felt like a robot was telling this story.Very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else. I forced myself to finish this. A huge diaappointment.Don't waste your money 
 Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones. Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs.  
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 i bought this for a friend so i dont like it. thats all i have to say 
 "Magnification", Yes' last studio effort shows that the boys still have what it takes to produce brilliant, inspiring, and worthwhile music. (IMHO "In the Presence Of" ranks right up there with the all-time Yes greats.) However, we don't need yet another rehashing of the past (no matter how great the music is). Members of Yes: please give your long-time fans at least one more album of new material to further assure your musical legacy. I gave this CD a rating of two stars because it could be valuable to new fans, but it will not satisfy the hard-core Yes fans who need some fresh original music from their favorite group 
 This novel deserves 5 stars.  I was given 44 Scotland Street as a Christmas gift. I assumed it was a "detective story" given the author's previous well known work. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was like nothing else I have ever read.  I have lived in Scotland and have visited Jenner's department store in Edninburgh, as well as some of the other landmarks mentioned in the book. I can assure readers who have not been to Edinburgh that the descriptions and the characterizations are very real, for example, the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow.  Although it may be difficult for non-Scots to fully appreciate certain elements of the book, the characters can be found practically anywhere and in any time. For example, the narcissistic Bruce and the class-conscious Sasha. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and especially homesick Scots.  I can hardly wait for the sequel 
 This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you. My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item.  Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it. I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper) Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it. I don't think no one will die from this type of trick 
 Once again, Koch, for reasons that I cannot possibly fathom, assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes. I know I'm feeling large amounts of gratitude. It's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone, right?  At least the copy I bought was used, so Koch didn't make a dime off of me. Anyway, this is another Koch release that you should definitely avoid 
 This book says absolutely nothing about the condition that America is in today; it says nothing about American history, nor the American people. It is just a collection of mindless warblings, fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right. I would not recommend this even for kitty litter. Burn it 
 Beginning in 1984 in a series of articles, Richard P. Saller, joined a bit later by his ally Brent D. Shaw, mistakenly contended that the ancient Romans married late - males on average at age twenty-eight, females at nineteen.  They cited hundreds of Latin epitaphs from the late Republic into the Christian empire which proved beyond reasonable doubt that fathers normally commemorated their sons who died before age twenty-eight and their daughters who died before age nineteen; after those ages spouses became the predominant commemorators of each other.  From this solid base they erroneously concluded that those were the average ages of marriage.  Although otherwise erudite, much of Saller's Patriarchy, Property and Death is based on these miscalculations. His corollary about marriage ages, upon which most all of his other conclusions were based, was deduced from a faulty axiom. That is, he claimed that the patria potestas was really rather insignificant because most Romans married for the first time after the deaths of their fathers.  In fact very, very few of the specific references collected to date corroborate such a late age for first marriage.    Regardless, the text has been praised to the skies in numerous reviews and gained a seemingly widespread acceptance, most notably in Debating Roman Demography (Brill, 2001), authored in part and edited by Walter Scheidel, the dean of Roman demography, and containing a long article by Shaw.  No one has yet seriously criticized this gross mistake 
 If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one 
 I enjoyed this book but found that it repeated information I could find online at sites like Faux Like a Pro - www.fauxlikeapro.co 
 When I first saw this film as a college student I thought it was ok, but not great.  Now that I've seen it for the second time, I don't even think it is ok.  I guess when I was younger, I either missed or wasn't so bothered by the way Robert Redford's character treats Barbara Streisand's, not to mention the way he treats his daughter.  He just leaves Katie right at the point when he finds out she's pregnant with his child.  And at the end of the movie it appears that he has never kept in touch with either of them.  This bothered me to the point where I just couldn't have any sympathy or any positive views about Redford's character and, without this, the movie doesn't work at all.          
 I am a longtime Govi fan and have all of his CD's.  That said, I have to agree with Amazon.com's editorial review of this CD. The two traditional Govi cuts on this release are darn good, but not among his best. The rest of the songs are, to me, filler material lacking a distinctive melody that do not generate any inner feelings, good or otherwise. The recording quality of "Jewel Box" is top notch. My overall conclusion: Govi has abandoned his great trademark sound for something that doesn't quite deliver. I sure hope that this is only a one-time experiment.     George M -- Phoenix, A 
 This was a HORRIBLE, annoying, obnoxious movie.  I will give Mandy Moore props for being a good actress but, Dianne Keaton's character got on my last nerve.  I kept thinking oh MY God can she be any less appealing.  If that were my mother I would throw my shoe at her.  I have never disliked a 'chic flick' until yesterday.  I went in thinking this would kind of be like Monster In Law but, I actually liked that movie.  I am just grateful that I only paid 4 bucks to see it during a matinee but, sorry that I lost 2 hours of my life.  
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 this movie sucks.  don't buy it.  the gore looks like spaghetti and it is boring as all hell.  if you like the camera-work of 10 year-olds and people who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag...this movie is for you.   p.s. the infamous "eye gouging" scene can't get much worse...i'm no medical professional...but if a sharp piece of wood penetrates a person's eyeball, shouldn't it bleed...a lot?  oh, i guess not when the shot suddenly switches from a real person into a fake eye closeup that couldn't fool any re-re on the planet.   
 the consept of giving the number 2s their due credit is good enough, and the stories and facts make for great reading and entertainment - in addition to serving several trivia purposes.  Improvement for the next issue must be pictures of all the artists - we know how they sang, now we also no why - but how did they look in their day?  Still - a great book!  
 I purchased to books from Amazon...this one and "Photovoltaics: Design & Installation". In the begininning of this book the author says that you should not try installing an PV system, leave it to the professionals. It kind of contradicts the title doesn't it? Maybe he should have said that on the cover. Being a pretty good DIY person I found that this book provides very little practical information on hiow to actually install a solar system. It lacks detail in in describing materials and "How To" guideance. A much better choice is "Photovoltacs: Design & Installation". Very detailed instructions with examples. There are work problems at the end of chapters to test your understanding. An excellent boo 
 I've just finished this book and found it rather annoying. Though I have enjoyed the Pitt series along the way, it seems that Anne Perry plays fast and loose with historical facts and, in this story, contrives an entirely unlikely key to resolve the plot.  Although no date for the story is given it appears to be set about 1880. The fact that Pitt and other characters have telephones at home, when the telephone was first invented in 1876 and not in general use until much later, is one problem. Another is a reference to someone's having seen another character's photograph in the newspaper, when photos were not used in newspapers until considerably later.  The chief bad guy in this story, police inspector Wetron, supposedly knows that one of his underlings is trying to catch him in illegal acts. So Perry has him leave a clue in his office that will lead the underling to his home, where apparently Wetron is planning on catching him. But the clue he leaves in his office is the real thing - a link to his criminal activity. How dumb can that be? And then he allows the underling to spirit him off on a wild goose chase in the middle of the night while his house is searched. The ridiculousness of this ruined the story for me. 
 I got this item to control pet hair as I have 2 dogs that shed.  It is ok, but not the performance I expected from dyson.  I love my vaccuum cleaner and figured this would be just as awesome.  Worth using, but not at the nearly 80.00 price tag.  If you can get a used one for half this price- then maybe 
 This Book's focus seemed to be more about justifying Bill Gates' actions, and defending Microsoft against negative PR than the actual history of Microsoft.  A more fact-filled, play-by-play history of the rise of Microsoft would have been more interesting, I think 
 I thought the book was uncreative, exhausted of plot and, lastly, Garfield has become so one-dimensional. All in all, though, if you have a Garfield  nostalgia that you can't just abandon, then you should, by all means, read  this book 
 A man of faith with the faith unspecified.  Back in the 1800's when his folks were in politics, they firmly believed the wrong side won the AMerican REvolution.  This book, written by a subject of the British throne reveals why Bush once again places us as peons and mercenaries for the british imperial crown.  Back in the 1800's the bush family joined Cotton MAther of Yale in burning landowners as witches in order to steal their profitable farms.   Now he demonizes the IRaqi nation and kills an estimated million of them to steal their oil fields  Nothing new under the sun. Only do not call it faith  FAith in the gun, maybe.  Saint JAmes writes even the devil believes in God and shudders in fear. Faith without good works is nothing. By their fruits will you know them. Bush's fruits stink to high heaven.  For a faith with good works read a theologian like the REverend Father John Dear's Jesus the rebel, and learn why every Christian faithful and true must firmly oppose George W Bush.   By the way, this piece of partisan politicizing which helped steal our 2004 elections by deceiving countless well-intended but eagerly gullible people is now going for fourteen cents. 
 If you learn by doing, this book is not for you. I have recently gone from PSE 2.0 to PSE 5.0 and really needed to learn the new features. When I bought PSE 2.0, I also bought "50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques". It was a wonderful book. It included a CD of photos used by the book, so the reader could start with the original photo and follow the book step-by-step to end up with the final image. The book showed the "before" and "after" and all of the steps in between. That is what I had in mind when I purchased this book. What a letdown. Some of the sample pictures that this book uses are available at their website, but the book does not indicate when to use their picture and specifically which sliders to manipulate and to what value to obtain the final result. So it does little more than explain what each of the features do. You can sit on your couch and read it. No `real-world' applications. Don't waste your money on this one 
 But not quite. While I wouldn't say this was a terrible novel, I also wouldn't say that it was in any way memorable. Because of the wonderful dramatization on the audio cassette, I passed an afternoon at work more  pleasantly, being entertained by the acting skills of the readers. However,  if I'd been merely reading a text version of this story, I wouldn't have  finished it because the plot did not interest me enough to deserve my full  attention. The characters are too typical of a mystery novel, the prose  style unremarkable, and the ending not too exciting 
 $174.99 is ridiculous!  You guys keep upping the price!  I paid $114.99 elsewhere 
 Prince is Talented,though I can't remember when I last heard it because he has dropped plenty of wack Music for a really,really long time.in hindsight He is basically a Musical Version of Puffy.meaning while Prince can play,He ain't never done anything remotely Original.He was in the late 70's through the 80's a Poor Man's Michael Jackson.then fast forward to the 90's on this long-winded Album he was trying to Jack R.kelly's style.interesting irony is that Michael Jackson&R.kelly could do Prince's whole thing in there sleep,but when he tired to Emulate them He comes across even more Corny than He already is.He will touch the King of Pop MJ&the King of R&B R.Kelly so maybe in the future Prince will find some Originality??I doubt it.He just bites off everyone.wasted Talent 
 The stars tell it all. The future is not happening for this book. But I don't want to be a shrew, so I'll just say, I don't like to be bored while reading and leave it at that 
 I applaud her for working through her difficulties by writing, however I'm not sure why every anti-Iranian author must be published. I also applaud Iranians in Iran, who although they suffered more, carry themselves with dignity 
 these are really beautiful glasses, and incredibly light.  we have no dishwashwer, though, and i broke one the first time i washed it (putting the dishsponge down inside) - and i was being careful.  these are really, really delicate.  my husband broke one the next day.  we also got the white wine version of these glasses, and one was broken upon arrival - still wrapped in its bubble wrap.  i have no idea why bodum decided to make these of such incredibly thin glass.  they're really beautiful, and we love using them, but it's ridiculous to have to be this careful with them - i mean, we have other wine glasses that i used to think were delicate, but these bodum ones take the cake.  we also bought the double-walled bodum glasses, and those are beautiful and much sturdier (although they're not for wine.....)  
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 I had a series of bad experiences with Amen Clinics. But I will just mention one, the latest. After they got my $3000, they were frankly uncooperative in dealing with the insurance companies. What they wanted to send to the insurance company included speculation that I had brain trauma (nearly everyone has brain trauma, in the Amen view.), that I had an alcohol problem (I mentioned it once.), and many other things. No psychiatrist worth anything would turn over that kind of information to an insurance company. It just isn't done, because the details of the session are considered priveleged, not public information. That Amen Clinics did not respect that common boundary should tell you volumes about whether to go there. My advice: Go to a reputable prescribing psychiatrist for 1/10 the cost 
 Total waste of money.  My daughter absolutely loves to paint.  She was so excited go get this.  The splatter tip is the only thing we could get to work.  Watch out, it splatters everywhere.  The plunger is impossible to fill all of the way.  The brush tip is useless, paint just oozes off of the end. The sponge tip is impossible to use.  By the time you have enough paint in the tip to use it, it too just oozes off the end. We have tried using this two different times with no success.
