 If you're a fan of Rush Limbaugh and actually believe that Fox News is "balanced", you'll love this book.  If not.....well, you get the message 
 You can usually rely on Minette Walters for a seminar on criminally disturbed minds. There's some of that in this novel but it's way, way too long. Ms. Walters introduces us to an interesting character in George (female), a councillor trying to unravel a couple of long-ago murders blamed on a young man with mental disabilities. She teams up with a professor with an enormous chip on his shoulder.  The two of them go off investigating and the book bogs down into hypothesis after hypothesis after hypothesis. It just goes on and on. If it hadn't been a Minette Walters book I would have put it down unfinished, but I kept hoping it was going to click into gear. It didn't.  Where was the editor? The book could have been whacked down to about half its length 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 Its probably worth the US$ 25 advertised if you are building an aluminium boat, but 'In the Kingdom of the Blind, the Man with One Eye Is King'. It is missing a lot of practical information on welding, distortion, welding schedule etc... its rather general, however, reading it and reading another two or three books available on the subject, you can make a concise picture at the end. 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 I refuse to believe that any human being can actually believe the hateful, uninformed, and often bewildering things that Ann Coulter says in this book. So if you're thinking about buying "Godless" or any other of Ann's hate speech because you're a conservative and want to read more about conservative beliefs, keep looking. Turning to this drivel to learn more about true conservatism is like trying to become an attorney by watching a Judge Judy marathon. It's entertainment for the lowest common denominator. Ann Coulter sells books by being outrageous and spewing craziness so you'll be interested. She doesn't care about conservatives, and she doesn't share your beliefs - I don't care who you are. All she cares about is taking your money. Do us all a favor and stop padding this woman's pockets. 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 The article that the author originally published appears as an appendix in this book reprinted in 1988.  Although the author is to be lauded for his breakthrough in the field, the book itself is mostly light fluff about the history of the area with the meat of the text in the appendices with the original articles.  Most of what is in this book can be found on the Internet in about 10 seconds with a good search engine looking for stonehenge astronomical alignments 
 Don't waste your time and money!! EXTREMELY poor product support! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit, then you're stuck with worthless software. I installed it on my computer making a complete backup of it. Then my computer crashed and I lost everything. I thought I was covered since I just made a full backup on an external hard disk but when I tried to do a restore Norton Ghost wouldn't recognize my external hard disk. I spent a full day with their support people and he finally gave up telling me he had to send the problem to the next level of support and that they would call me within 48 hours. Nobody called! I bought their Extended Download service and tried to download the product again. It didn't work and after spending 8 hours online and on the phone I still haven't got a working copy. The product key they said I needed and I tried to use also doesn't work. I'm writing my credit card company next to try and get a credit but I expect the same result - NO credit back and software that doesn't do what Norton said it would do 
 I don't for a second believe that Burroughs is telling the truth about his life -- but I gobbled up his other books anyway.  He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily "colors" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.  That said, he lapses here.  This isn't as approachable a book and the narrator is isn't so much funny as he is unlikeable.  By turns smug and arrogant, too much of this feels self-indulgent.  Chafingly, distractingly so 
 At first glance this book looked like a really fun read.  Cute cover and catchy concepts it seemed like it would something right up my alley.  I was very wrong.  The book talks all about the sort of girlfriends that one may want to have or hope to have over the course of her lifetime.  That's all fine and dandy (not to mention obvious) but does anyone really need to read 200+ pages of the author's fond memories of her friends? Is it necessary to suck up to Oprah right in the dedication and then barely mention her in those 200+ pages? I also did not appreciate the cheap marketing ploy that involved the author plugging her stupid pajama line.  I don't think that the author imparts any true words of wisdom and I seriously doubt there is much for anyone to gain by reading this book.  You could do better things with your time like perhaps watching Thelma & Louise, A League of their Own, Beaches, Steel Magnolias, etc.... Don't waste your time or money on this.  Don't even waste a trip to the library - grab a girlfriend and go shopping instead!!!! 
 OK, this review is not about the book, it's about the live Def Poetry Jam production, I apologize, but I'm so angry after seeing it on December 12, I'm posting negative reviews wherever possible.  If you want to have your intelligence insulted with crackpot theories about how the US government staged 9/11, then by all means spend your hard-earned dollars on this garbage, be it the show or the book.  Otherwise, vote with your money and tell these hate-mongers to take a hike 
 Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics.  However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments.  The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture.  This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters 
 Desdemona is an odd ball in her family.  She comes from a family of theater people, but she doesn't have any of the family talent for acting.  Instead, she runs a catering company that helps keep the rest of the family financial stable.  Stark runs a computer security company and first meets Desdemona when he is jilted and Desdemona is trying to collect on her catering bill for a wedding that never happened.  The characters in the book seem flat and with about 100 pages left I found myself skimming because I didn't really care what happened.  Sometimes the characters just acted completely irrationally.  For example, they didn't call the police when major evidence was found in a murder case.  I just couldn't get into it when the characters seemed so ridiculously unreal 
 I am sorry, as much as I love historical fiction, and as much as I LOVED Shadowbrook, I could not get into this book.  While I appreciate the amount of research the author did into medical history of this time and treatment of slaves, the gore factor is WAY OVER THE TOP. Page after page after page, compounded with unappealing characters who even if one started to care, disappeared into another generation.    I gave up after 200 pages.  I give the author kudos for the well done research and keeping with known facts, but as stated before, the gore factor is way over what I can stomach for 600 pages.  If you are not sure if this is for you, I suggest you check it our from your local libary.  Then, if you absolutely love it, buy it.  JMHO 
 I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said "So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it." I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it! Divorce is against God's law, and I feel extremely strong about this. I cannot believe the message Ann M. Martin is sending to readers!  
 I was trying to make up my mind about purchasing this book but can't very well trust the reviews.  I mean someone who hasn't even read it gave it 5 stars.  Also, after some negative reviews there was a flood of reviews in the 4-5 star range.  It makes it appear as if some people are trying to skew the results.  It really makes you question how good a read it is 
 I just don't get the sixties guys sometimes. Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others,  it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature. This is a smug book, with its smugness somewhat masked by Southern's cutesy tones and farcical situations that he sets up. Maybe it was groundbreaking then, but it comes off as a bit dated and ineffectual now 
 I did not enjoy this book and would not use it in my work 
  It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.  I thought, What the freak, I've got a pretty inquisitive mind and I'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.  The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, "Prepare to be dazzled."  Well, evidently Ol' Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I won't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because I don't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  So I won't mention that.)  If you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask "But how?" - then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call "common sense."  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).  I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that "drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health."  Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.  In chapter 4, Smug Mug "proves" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.  Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  That's funny, me neither.  There's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.  In dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws "simply don't bring down crime."  (Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN & VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)  In dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  Ya think?   Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.  He calls some abortions a "crude and drastic sort of insurance policy."  Not "immoral."  Not "sinful."  But then I didn't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.    And even if Levitt and Dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  So why are we even discussing this?  I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to "statistically" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  I find this repulsive!  (And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)  I won't even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?  Suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  Just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are "unenlightened."  If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn't turning the "child's brain to mush."  (No word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)  And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show "that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each."  (I've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)  I've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy's fight against the "three Ks."  But if you're smarter than I am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  Economically speaking, that's just "common cents." 
 Well, this guy I have been hearing for several months among the on-line King fandom groups I am a member to, and me thinks that he is worth to check out---I go through his backcatalogue, seeing that aside from the Girl Next Door, almost identified with his name, there are a few more pieces which are highly praised...then me sees a story collection and thinking that short stories will be a good starting point for a new author to prevent any disappointment which rather cloaks on you with doorstoppers- so me orders it from Amazon UK, gets the book and starts to read it- then asks what the hell is happening?  Yes, me agrees Ketchum's writing is good- he is close to Stephen King and Peter Straub (you like his characteris- as is always in King books, characters have a life outside the pages of the stories) yes his prose is flowing (thank God there is another author better than the syrupy Dean Koontz in horror/ thriller segment)but what is lacking is substance- I know short story is a format of short tales, as its name suggests but should they be this short? Should every theme be a a story? take the story of father and son: The purpose? The excitement factor? The guessing factor? The building factor? No, no ,no It is as if Jack Ketchum, while jumping between house tasks, sat down on his way from kitchen to dining hall to bathroom and wrote a story each time. There are so many stories that it seems like a heaven at the first glance but you can easily cut three-fourth of them because they are...too pointless for the sake of heaven.   some of the stories -Rifle,the Visitor and Megan's Low and Snakes- are true chillers and effective stories -another very good one one wtihout a chilling factor is the one that involves squirrel hunting but I cannot remember its name- It is as if the longer the story gets, the more effective Ketchum is- and then of course there is the Closing Time the longest story -almost a novella (taking intou account the length of stories in the book) but it is one of the most pointless things I have ever read in my life. And I cannot help but think that if I was to write more than 30 stories I think at least three or four of them would be effective- just like in case of Jack Ketchum  If it is not for Ketchum's prose, I would completely disregard him but it appears that his novels should be more effective. Skeleton Crew was the first book I laid my hands and devoured from Stephen King and it turned me into a semi-rabid fan- Night Shift was even better...But this is fully contrary in Ketchum's case: I am sorry to say that Ketchum loses me in his short form and his first impression on me is that he is not as creative as I think- just like Dean Koontz, he puts onto paper whatever comes to his mind- but thank God his prose saves him to the nnnth degree where Koontz cannot hold a candle in this respect (and thank God Ketchum, like King, equally treats animas, you do not feel there are only  smart cute golden retrievers around the globe)  Skeleton Crew made a score for King, making me a constant reader, but Ketchum should try once more (or several more times) As usual my top three modern horror masters remain the same:  1. Stephen King 2. Peter Straub 3. Clive Barker  But the fourth place changes: Ketchum effectively pushes Dan Simmons and Robert McCommon one rank below:  4. Jack Ketchum 5. Dan Simmons 6. Robert McCommo 
 I have to disagree with the other reviewers and I know that some real Reich fanatics will probably hate this review, but I have to be completely honest with this.   I used to be a great fan of Steve Reich and for the music he created in the 60's,70's and 80's he is justly going to be remembered as one of the great composers of the 20th Century. Unfotunately I don't think he has created a truly great or memorable piece of music since Different Trains in 1988, now that's a long time for a composer. In fact his output has been frustratingly small since then and the works he has produced have been very mixed and none of them anywhere close to his great pieces like Music For 18 Musicians and Different Trains. Still I'm always open to the chance that Reich will deliver the goods so I keep buying his new releases when they come out but I've been disappointed by almost everything since Different Trains. This CD is no exception.  You Are (Variations) is the major piece here, I attended it's UK premiere in the Barbican earlier this year and the ultimate reaction I had then was one of supreme underwhelment. The piece was fine, some of it is almost retrospective and thus gives one the initial feeling that 'Yes Reich has finally found his voice again', but after a few listens the piece just left me completely flat, much as Three Tales, The Cave, Triple Quartet and City Life made me feel. After listening to 'You Are' a few times and feeling underwhelmed I actually decided to listen again to a few of the older Reich pieces that I hadn't listened to in a while, just to check to see if perhaps I had gone off Reich altogether, but no. I listened to Music for Mallets, Music for A Large Ensemble, Six Pianos, Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards all in quick succession and felt elated at the end. THIS music is what made Reich so great, the glorious slow modal and consonant harmonic movement, wonderful orchestration, attention to detail etc., all make for compelling listening. But with You Are as with much of Reich's recent work we have him struggling to think up new ideas and instead of developing on the wonderful rhythmic innovations he pioneered he has tried to make his harmonic voice more dissonant and in doing so more European sounding, now I'm not saying this music is in any way like Boulez or Stockhausen, it is still most certainly Reich, but it almost feels like it is a psuedo-Reich piece written by someone else who doesn't want to make it too obvious it is a Reich rip-off! The one person who is often accused of writing like this is John Adams and I have to say that there were times when I thought 'You Are' sounded a bit like John Adams! I used to listen to Adams and think the odd bit sounded like Reich, but while Adams has certainly moved on in style to some success, Reich has just failed to come up with anything satisfying in nearly two decades and this piece is no different. It is frankly boring, uninspiring music, it sounds more technical than from the heart. I'm sure scholars could write essays on certain innovative aspects of this and other recent Reich pieces, but that doesn't disguise the fact that it is dull, cold uninspired music. Ironically some people consider his earlier works to be dull, cold and uninspired but I find them to be full of vitality and truly inspiring masterpieces. You Are (Variations) certainly isn't.  Then comes Cello Counterpoint which I was really looking forward to. I love the Counterpoint series, Electric Counterpoint got me hooked on Reich in the first place and then Vermont Counterpoint and Clarinet Counterpoint are equally great pieces, but again Reich disappoints with Cello Counterpoint. It is more like Triple Quartet in it's overall sound and structure and while I don't expect Reich to simply rewrite Electric Counterpoint for Cello, there is just something about the harmonic language Reich uses in this piece and other recent works which doesn't feel right to me. I enjoy certain dissonant music when it is done well, but this music is a really strange kind of dissonance, it is not jarring dissonance and it is not lush harmoniousness (as say Music for 18 is) it is somewhere in between that is just dull, it is really muddy harmony which just doesn't suit the rhythmic material well.  So I'm sorry Reich fans, I was once like you, but I'm afraid I've just lost faith in him now. In a way he's gone the same way as Stravinsky who really lost the plot in later years by turning to serialism. Reich is still his own man, but he's just got incredibly boring.   
 I just completed this book yesterday and I must confess if it was any longer I might not have.  While it was mildly entertaining, it contains little that is new or particularly informative.  The book generally repackages concepts that are written elsewhere and ties them to passages in Churchill's life.  Many of the comparisons seem strained.  In fact, comparing Churchill's almost single-handed stand aginst tyranny with normal business competition, seems inappropriate and a little silly.      It's probably fair to say that the book contains a few kernals of wisdom which would be helpful to anyone in business, or otherwise. These kernals are relatively simple and (it seems to me) obvious.  It begs the question, Why, exactly, do we need a book such as this?       The people most apt to pick-up the book in the first place are those who already have a more than passing affinity for Churchill.  If so, those people will likely have read books which are more informative, historically significant, insightful and generally worthwhile.  If this is your first introduction to Churchill, do not let it be your last.  Overall, I think there are much better uses for all of our valuable time 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
 As a die-hard Cathy fan, just bought this book without looking at it..expected more cartoons, a larger book.  The recipes seem to be those you can find in any cookbook - mashed potatoes?? hot fudge sauce??  Very disappointed.  If there was more about Cathy in the book it might be worth it..but this was waste of money 
 This is an essential read for anyone interested in the contemporary Argentine history. The writer is an acknowledged expert on the subject. Why then have I awarded it one star? Because the translation is appallingly bad, at times bordering on the incomprehensible. One gets the impression that it was done one word at a time, dictionary in hand. If you are not already familiar with the events and personalities of the period you'll have difficulty figuring out what's going on.  Conclusion: Only for those who are never, ever going to learn to read Spanis 
 Over the years, I have read many excellent books on the subject of advaita - this is not one of them. Even the title is dualistic: 'I' hope 'you' die soon, that's two. And what is this future you speak of? Can you show it to me?  I have discovered that if the title is cliche and doesn't resonate - I SHOULDN'T READ IT! The title not only fails to be relative, but utterly fails, reflecting the writer's innermost feelings of despair and poison, which can be felt as one reads. After reading the three (3) testamonials on Amazon.com, I was inclined to read, yet as I proceeded, it dawned on me that the endorsements must be written by members of his own family. Because it was all redundant, drab, and regurgitated psycho-babble just like Tony's, I would say anyone would be better off dead than reading this. Just feel 'I' and spare yourself the slow torture of this masacre of the truth. If you must read a book on the subject, read Ramesh Balsekar or Ramana Maharshi, not this plagiarized brochure to authenticate Tony's enlightenment. 
 These wipes are horrible. My powerbook had more streaks than you can imagine. Buy the Monster Brand Screen cleaner instead, It is awesome 
 After reading the "Other Bolyne Girl" I was keen to read another novel by Philippa Gregory. However, this was a very disappointing read, it is  poorly written, the story was not engaging and there was little substance.I could not even bring myself to finish this novel 
 I bought this for my 9 year old without looking at it. There is a picture of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake and the wardrobe malfunction. When did that become a world record? I wish I hadn't bought this 
 I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.  The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.  Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.  The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's naï¿½ve and unique generosity.  That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.   For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!  In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.  She wants readers to get an "insight into the psychology" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.  My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.   I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is "The Virgin's Lover"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel "The Queen's Fool" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful "Earthly Joys" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)  So, get "The Other Boleyn Girl" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).   But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's "Legacy" 
 This is a weak GH!!! Mary has had a lot more hits then what was included on this compilation package!!! They could have done a lot better and spent a little more time putting this GH together!! 
 I almost put the book down after a 100 pages as I couldn't figure out what it was about or where it was going. The ending was equally bad, the book just goes no where besides talking about anti establishment type themes. Horrible. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
 Overacted. Boring. Horrible movie. The only likable character was Cat. 
 to me..this release sounded more like a  super-roots/rebore than a boredoms release.  The pre-mixed tracks dont seem new ( think I recognize a few from previous CDS)   and yea..  its boring...  after so long telling everybody that these guys are a musical Icon...  they have created another "PIOUGHED" (another god type band.. "who jumped the shark"? )  I can only hope the future is brighter,  but my guess is that the days are gone of outstanding boredoms releases and ..  hmm..  I dont know..  it makes me sad.. 
 Why do singers feel the need to butcher these very old holiday songs?  Sing it right, people, or don't sing it at all.  Rimes totally destroyed an incredible Christmas song.  Easily the worst version I've ever heard and I've heard alot 
 Not much information to find in this book, though it can be entertaining if you are bitter and need to find something to read while you are in the same situation.  Don't look for answers from this self helper, there are none.  Spend your money on ice cream instead.  You'll be happy you did 
 Some novelists are known for a pared down, no-nonsense approach to narrative, firmly delineated, plainspoken characters, crackling, lively dialogue, and swiftly moving, engrossing plots.  Lezama-Lima is not one of those authors.  It's hard to recommend a book that I have so many reservations about.  Yes, the writing is occasionally beautiful, and as an historical document of a certain type of artistic and literary milieu in Pre-Castro Cuba, it's worth something.  But I'm afraid that I'm going to have disagree with all of the reviewers here and say that LL's endless aestheticism must be something of an acquired taste.  The problem is that he writes prose too much like a poet--all florid circumlocutions with no feel for the rhythms of everyday life and speech.  No doubt he would have felt the everyday to be beneath his austere heights.  Nobody talks the way his characters do--it's all lengthy, abstruse theorizing on frequently esoteric subjects.  His essentially elitist approach to writing fiction would test the patience of anyone who looks to literature for a more immediate kind of connection.  And, sorry, Mr. White, LL is not the Latin American Proust--Proust is far more readable and speaks to more basic human experiences.          Sometimes some of the worst snobs are those (i.e., homosexuals) who have themselves suffered the most heinous abuse because of their dubious social stature--rather than reject the values of the mainstream, a writer like LL ends up embodying them and perpetuating them to an infuriating degree through his snobbish affectations.  Or else one could view his aesthetic vision as essentially escapist, understandable given the political situation in Cuba at the time.  Still, a more accurate view of what was actually happening might have been of more human interest--it would have been valuable to see how these characters strained to maintain their sensibility in view of what was actually occurring around them.  But, as it is, the book seems to exist in a vacuum with no real connection to the political situation in Cuba--its Eurocentric preoccupations offend.    
 This is a good product. Not as good as an MP3 player with internal memory, as it is bulkier. But, it is great for the price. The only drawback is, it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory. Running with it can be uncomfortable at times...if you are a runner, you may prefer a smaller mp3 player, one you can put in your shorts pocket... 
 911 was an inside job. Our constitution, our civil liberities are being taken away. The FBI has even concluded that they don't have any proof that Bin Laden was behing the 911 attacks. Moreover, what confounds me with regard to this book is that half of the identies of the real hijackers have never been established. I hope and pray people wake up.  
 The bike came in a timely fashion however it seemed to be damaged during delivery.  I returned the item for a refund 
 Okay, I was excited to see this movie.  I read a few non fiction books on the dot.com bust and thought I knew a thing or two, but when I watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more, I found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from.  I mean, WHO cares about these people's relationships??  NOT ANYONE WHO IS WATCHING THIS MOVIE!  We care about why and how businesses succeed and fail.  This movie sucked 
 There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?  Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!  It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent.  The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...   The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it 
 The book is not well written.  The author does not clearly explain her thinking, she hops from topic to topic without connecting the ideas behind the topics, and always assumes that the reader has some working knowledge on the matter she is writing about.  That is not to say that the book cannot be useful.  The author has some good points on why technical analysis can work, but it is a petty that more often than not her message does not come across. 
 I'm a big Mann fan, and i even enjoy his not very good non noir or western films, thunder bay for instance. a great director, but this one stinks. i can't even get up the enthusiasm to criticise i 
 The moment I saw this book in our local bookstore, I quickly grabbed it. The title is very eye-catching since I'm very interested about the sciences, and Geography is one fascinating subject. The book is written in simple terms and easy to understand. What I didn't like about the book is that it's explicitly very biased against the creation theory. On the earlier pages, the author clearly stated that science is dynamic which I or presumably anyone will understand that when it comes to the sciences nothing is certain. Yet the author appears to be preaching the THEORY of evolution as a fact. I thought books like this calls for unbiased and unpartial content. So I scanned the back pages looking for his credentials. And I found my evidence, "don't know much about Davis".  
 I've read all of Dianne Dorrans Saeks books and own many of them. I eagerly await each new addition so I was very dissapointed in California Interiors.It appears to be written and photographed for a European market.  It's all stuff we've seen over and over again with no cohesive theme. The  graphics aren't up to her usual standards, the book doesn't seem to have  any design. It looks as though it's a first time effort 
 I saw this on TV when it came out. I'm sure it was a made-for-TV movie, and it should have stopped there. I remember looking forward to seeing it, then was totally bummed out. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the original, but geeze, it shouldn't be allowed to have the same name or main character. Totally different plot, totally corny. Was this made to be a chick flick? Someone mentioned what's his names blue eye's, and the woman in peril. If I remember he has to drive through Utah to Idaho and plays chicken with the cops. No cop is going to play chicken! Why doesn't he buy a freakin' plane ticket? Instead he tries to kill himself so his wife has nobody. Arrggh 
 This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it 
 This novel is a collection of shallow bigotries of someone ignorant of what he writes.  It takes place in Texas.  All the main Texan characters are white and wealthy poorly educated hateful people. A cameo appearance by a family of migrant farmworkers contrasts them as heroic and well educated as they quote European philosophers. Besides the main hero, the other main protagonist is a Jewish Lesbian Vegetarian Harvard Law graduate there to "give back" and save the underpriveledged from their white masters. There are constant and tedious descriptions of how much the author doesn't like the Texas climate. For someone who writes about a hero who is a firearms expert from the military, this author makes some of the most absurd technical mistakes I have ever read. He even describes the primer of a cartridge as the "firing pin". I doubt he has even touched a gun in his life. This book is so full of obnoxious and insulting cliches I'm offended I read it. I only finished it because it was the only book I had with me on a hunting trip, which is ironic as this protagonist, who brutalizes or kills anyone who offends his sensibilities, thinks of himself as pure because he doesn't indulge in such an evil activity as hunting for food 
 Although the author purports to take an objective view of what he calls the clash of cultures in Postville, his portrait of the conflicts in the town are in no way nuanced or thoughtful. Clearly his ambivalence about his own religious identity has shaped his perception of life in Postville. The author has not taken the time to learn about the Orthodox Jewish traditions he so smugly and sanctimoniously dismisses as "guilt-producing." He manages to reduce his concept of  meaningful Judaism to bagels, lox, and pastrami. By the end of the book I found myself wondering why he  had bothered to identify himself as Jewish since his view of the religious traditions he derides seem so superficial to him. To me the book failed the basic test of intellectual honesty and clarity of thought. It was in addition, poorly written 
 Genny and Alec meet in America and from that point on it goes downhill. This book was immediately put in the trash.  I kept reading it hoping it would get better, it didn't, it got worse.  Alec was a barbarian and needed taken down a notch or two.  He wasn't even worthy of Nesta, let alone Genny.  There was no real closure to their problems and Alec's cruel heart, either.  How could you believe he loved her?  Genny needs to hit him on the head again 
 I have read all three books in this trilogy. I started with Earth Song not knowing that it was a trilogy. Earth Song is #2 and it is very enjoyable. It is funny and it held my interest. Then I went to #1 and finally to #3 which is Fire Song. The main male characters..Roland in Secret Song and I can't remember the guys name in Fire Song...border on insane! They are so jealous and suspicious through the entire book. Well, to be fair, the last 10 pages they find they really love the lady...too late for me I guess. At one point Daria got so mad at Roland she knocked him down some stairs. I enjoyed reading that part because he deserved it. I love Catherine Coulter's writing but found myself getting mad reading this after the guys had called their ladies lying and deceitful one too many times! 
 I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son.  But this book is surprisingly bland.  The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns.  The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages.  If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham 
 Finally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty! Yunnus has proven, by the success of his bank's loans to the desperately poor, that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support. Founder of the Grameen Bank, he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world (including the US and Canada) have shown that lending to the poor, helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried. Yunnus' book is inspiring and an eye-opener. It made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations cannot bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help. It's hard to separate the book from the idea. One is as fascinating as the other. Out of 5 points, I give it a six 
 This book was a reading for my 3rd grade daughter.  I have no idea how or why this book EVER won an award, unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written.  And the illustrations were just as sad 
 David Shenk's new book, "The Immortal Game" is a nostalgic journey through the history of chess and indeed, the influence of chess on history. In the context of searching his own chess past, Shenk provides a rich collection of chess facts and anecdotes. This is all tied together as the author reviews the remarkable chess game between Anderssen and Kierseritzky.  The book does present some interesting material. However, I cannot recommend the book. The book was just too simplistic and geared for an audience that has only limited exposure to chess. For comparison, try "Searching For Bobby Fischer" by Fred Waitzkin 
 I have to agree with Greg Ippolito's review.  The album is simply incomplete without Dirk Diggler's "You Got The Touch."  The most significant musical moment in the film.  Hard to believe it's not on Volume 2 either.  A shame 
 not very good not worth getting it is not good pokefan is wrong and im right not the same as original boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo bo 
 you have to read it in Russian. You CANNOT CANNOT CANNOT, and i repeat, CANNOT (!) read it in translation- its like trading feces for gold. That is literally what it sounds like in comparison to the original. The specificity, brutality, the sumptuous tenderness of the Russian language are all but lost in these translations of one of this century's greatest poets. Although you might enjoy what you are reading, given you do not speak Russian- you honestly cannot even BEGIN to touch the greatness of Akhmatova or any other Russian poet by reading it in translation.   I honestly don't know who came up with the concept of translating poetry- to me its barbaric. A poem is so brief, it is so immediate and so dependent upon every word- no one should ever touch it. If you want it bad enough, learn Russian. And just so you know, reading Russian poetry in its original form is MORE than worth going through the trouble of learning the language. There is nothing in the world like it- nothing. It beats Shakespeare. 
 This CD is just bad.  I've made myself listen to it all the way through about 6 times over trying to get myself into it, and I just can't.  There's only like 2 good songs and the rest are bad.  The beats sound like some ameteur producer made them; the rapping from Cam'ron and guests sounds like people who're trying rap for the first time, and the lyrics are garbage.  I mean, I absolutely love rap and hip-hop and have been a devoted listener since 1994, but this CD just didn't do it for me.  Maybe hardcore Cam'ron fans would like this, but in my opinion, you could close your eyes at some CD store and pick a better rap CD than this 
 Bush is winning the war on terror?    Who here is sufficiently blissfully ignorant to still believe that?  Iraq has completely imploded--even CENTCOM has acknowledged that we are fast approaching "chaos" and total anarchy there.  Bush's occupation there is effectively at an end.  As for Afghanistan, the military now admits that the Taliban is making a major, widespread resurgance, and now controls much of the country.  Our recent bid to push back at their growing offense ended in failure. In fact, we now only control the capital of Kabul, and that only tenuously.  Of course, Bin Laden still runs free, laughing at those he killed on 9/11.  No, the sad, plain truth is that Bush is not in any way, shape or form winning the war on terror.  This book has simply become a pathetic relic of a bygone era, useful only as an object of sarcastic mockery and derision.  Bush, like those who believed in him, has become nothing more than a very sad joke. 
 Nothing in the description indicates that this is heavily abridged. The introduction (after you've purchased the book) actually refers to this version not as translated (no translator is credited) but paraphrased. It is not even partitioned into St. Augustine's original 13 "books," but is instead resectioned with "new" chapter titles. I had to repurchase the book 
 I bought this cable hoping for a reasonably priced alternative to the outrageously priced Apple cable.  This cable worked fine to charge my iPod when plugged into an inexpensive 110V USB charger.  But I had major difficulties when I tried using it as a synch cable.  I had frequent USB lock-ups with this cable plugged in to my laptop (i.e. mouse and keyboard freezing).  And when I foolishly tried to update the software on my son's iPod over this cable it trashed the iPod firmware, requiring a full reset of the pod and reload of all music.  Given the very low price I guess I shouldn't complain too much, but it went into the trash shortly after it arrived 
 it is no problem to admit that i heartily envy ms kushner writing skill: she is a wondrous writer, she handles her language with a subtlety unheard of and still she manages to avoid any overwriting, any mannerism.  the story itself, though, is not great: some reviewers say it is true to the legend: should it be really so, then the problem might lie in the original plot.  be it as it may, characterization is dull, except for the elderly couple, and elfland is lushiously boring, the queen being the worst of all.  the verses included are enjoyable 
 Repetitive, boring, but sometimes effective. This set of CDs skirts around essentials, offerring too little to stand on its own as an introduction to Italian 
 I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet.  After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be "banned from the universe" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not "Playboy" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY. 
 I'll be honest. I didn't read the whole book. I tried, but bad writing grates on my nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard. Readers who think this book is well written are obviously the same ones who think Ayn Rand is a good writer. Or perhaps they're of the literary type that equate really long paragraphs--we're talking several pages here--with good writing.   That said, the opening pages showed some promise as a sustained joke about the shallowness of the privileged classes. Or maybe the priggishness of the French. Alas, the punch line never arrived.   We are introduced to the professor on the hill, who looks through his spyglass at the seething shiploads of filthy dark people poised to overrun his community. He revels in his fine home, with its aged wines and gourmet food, and even its chests of worn-out linens that his family, on principle, refused to give to the poor. No mention of how the professor's family acquired the comforts the professor finds so dear; the filthy peasants who presumably worked his ancestors' feudal estates under the lash; the labor that built the professor's fine home in his elite neighborhood.   Shortly after, we meet the laughably stereotyped hippie, the 1970's version of the anti-christ in whose mouth Raspail places all the ideas the seventies middle class held about what hippies thought and did. The professor has a refined and learned answer for this hippie's anarchist rantings: he pulls out a gun and shoots him.   One reader cautioned that some of the characters bordered on the stereotypical. I would challenge you to find one character here that borders on the real. Raspail's people are almost ethereal; they are mere coathangers on which Raspail has hung the off-the-shelf costumes of the players whose existence is necessary in order to bring about the cataclysm he proposes.  Is Raspail a racist? Oh, no. He is careful to include a brown character who is one of the elite because he too enjoys fine wine and can discuss the classics. And a white character who suffers from the sin of compassion that has got the folks in the hills so riled up.  Fast forward to now. The Far East is too busy doing all the jobs the Western elite has transferred to their shores to commandeer ships and invade Europe, and Europe is suffering from a population decline that makes them wish that more of those dark, teeming millions would in fact arrive. Only the United States, with its porous borders and endless influx of Mexicans, has escaped the looming depopulation catastrophe. It's hard to see what the appeal of this piece of dated, overt xenophobia could possibly have for anyone in the 21st century. 
 I just finished reading "Black's Law Dictionary," and I must say I disagree with many of the reviews on this board. I thought the story was fairly uninteresting and the characters one-dimensional. It started strong (the "animus capiendi" scene comes to mind) but it dragged in the middle and ended flat (too much time spent on the "year-and-a-day rule"). I will admit I thoroughly enjoyed the list of British Regnal Years in Appendix G. Good effort by the author, the up-and-coming Black, but just two stars from this reviewer. 
 The reason I am giving one star to this book is because a lot of people have given 5 stars to it. Personally I would give it about 2 and a half stars.  The main reasons for my low rating are: - The book jumps in to configuration commands without giving the proper links. The information is too disjointed. Too few actual configuration examples. The book seems littered with config commands without talking much about what info is shown by the specific show commands. How to use the commands in troubleshooting scenarios et al.  - The way in which the information is presented could have been better. Concepts seem to have been explained in a half hearted manner. And per point one, the author jumps directly to config commands.  + The book does a good job at covering the exam. If you wanna clear the exam, this book is for you. However, if you wanna understand stuff and then actually clear the exam, be prepared to go to other sources. One excellent reference source is the CCIE Cisco LAN switching book. I ended up reading about 18 chapters (out of 20) from this book, and I only came to know about the CCIE book later on. I got it and yes it was worth every cent. Any concept (except QoS) that I needed clarification was present in the CCIE book 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 When she utters the line "I feel so violated"...Reba is totally inept as an actress in this movie.  THe story is inspiring and uplifting but McEntire is no actress.  She is a complete and total failure which bogs the movie down.  Its a shame they couldn't have had a "real" actress play this part.  THe movie would have been wonderful and worthy of a five star rating.  The supporting cast is o.k. but when they play off McEntire they look inept.  SHe makes them look bad.  I'm sorry but acting is not McEntire's forte.  
 Worst of all time.  Flanigan and Zingale just defecated on my face with this pile of waste.  My life has been wasted, I feel raped and alone. Watch CNN during election time and gather everything you ever need to know about the material in this book 
 This is a first novel that has some of the usual first-novel faults:loose ends that are never tied up, over-plotting, and dialogue that doesn't always ring true.  But the larger fault is that the author doesn't seem to know what her book is really about.  At first, it seems like it's going to be a timely pro-choice thriller, one that follows the machinations of a group of anti-choice fanatics and their impact not only on an idealistic doctor who performs abortions, but also on his wife and children.  However, the title turns out to be misleading, since the doctor's wife is only one of a number of main characters, and in fact, "the artist's wife" might have been a better title, since the story becomes increasingly about the neurotic, deeply damaged wife of the artist who's having an affair with "the doctor's wife."  This deranged woman becomes part of an anti-abortion lunatic fringe group, with huge implications for the plot line.  The author tries to explore this woman's mind, and understand why she's drawn to the anti-abortion group, but with only limited success.   Eventually, the abortion plot line disappears, overwhelmed by various melodramatics set in motion by the artist's wife.  The author is clearly pro-choice, so her efforts to be "fair" (if such a thing were possible!) to the nut-cases who think that killing doctors is OK, in the name of saving fetuses, fall flat. This is truly a debate that has only one side: and that side is whichever side you're on.  There is no common ground, not even a remote possibility of one side understanding the other's thinking and motivations, so the author has set herself an impossible task, one at which she's bound to fail.   The ending is both too melodramatic and-- for this reader-- ideologically unsatisfying.  Without revealing the details of the ending, it seems to me that the pro-choice side loses this particularl battle, which is NOT the way I either expected or wanted the novel to end 
 I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago. A week ago it just stopped working. I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore. So I went out and bought the exact same steamer. I used it for 2 days and then on the third day, yesterday, it wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm taking it back today and getting something else 
 This is arguably George Michael's most personal offering to date where he sings of love (American Angel), the Past (Round Here) and death (Mother Had A Brother)...All tracks that tick along quite nicely. But that is the problem. For an artist so talented, he really needs to be pushing boundaries and not producing background lounge music !! He lifts the pace somewhat with the best track 'Amazing', 'Flawless' - with it's pumping disco beat, and the political 'Shoot The Dog' (not available on all CD's as the song was pulled off the American version)..But it is not enough to recover the uneventfulness of this collection...What you do get for your money is at max 4 decent tracks, George's beautiful voice and perfect production...not sure if that is enough to pay the asking price 
 I was initially offended by this book, as it implies that all friendships between blacks and whites serve the purpose of making the white person feel cool and muticultural. But, I spent my had-earned money on this book, so I quickly decided to leave my whiteness at the door and have a laugh. I mean, I have known my fair share of white liberals who use their black friends/colleagues/lovers/students as multiculturalism collateral. But, ater awhile, as that is THE only premise of the book, the humor got old, and the author implies that any friendship between a white person and a black person is akin to black slavery. Whats that? Was I enslaving my black friend from college when I crashed at her place while in New York and complained to her about how fat I felt? And how many times did the author have to mention the white persons desire to touch the black persons hair? not only is this book one note, it is one-sided, and maybe even offensive. i only read it for a book club. i gave it two stars instead of one because, I have to admite, for awhile ther it was funny. 
 Once upon a time I thought Jeff Sachs was both a genius and a tower of integrity....then I read this tragic work.  This book is the result of what happens when a brilliant mind goes "Hollywood". As a Financial Economist who actually lives in Africa...it is obvious to me that Jeff is selectively clueless about how things really work here. Then again...I think Jeff knows exactly what the people he works for at the UN want to hear. 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 I bought 2 pair and the light did not work on one pair at all and the light only worked on the other pair initially then stopped working as soon as the mask got wet (and never worked again). Very disappointing because they sounded like a lot of fun 
 I was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to Budapest when this card died. I was using my new Canon Rebel XT, which had no problems with my 1 GB cards throughout my 17 day trip. I lost an entire day of photos. I would not recommend this product to anyone 
   This book is an aquired taste.  If you have a taste for a sexual read about Indians, wait don't get too excited yet, this is not just about sex.  No, no, no it is a graphic novel that lets you the reader know every detail while describing two men having homosexual intercourse in the story "The Toughest Indian in the World" now that may be something you are intrested in, but as for me I would rather take a bath.  So if you are in the mood for homosexual sex, fat naked Indian women, chump men, adultry in the worse degree (with a fat ugly man) and little boys being forced to have sex with an older woman while doctors watch, don't buy this book, you can have mine for free 
 Once again Ultra records has put it's trust into New York DJ's, and the results are not pleasing.  Disc one mixed by Vic Latino from NYC is good enough for radio (stick to KTU) but not for the higher standards set by the UK DJ's who are always well ahead of the game. Bad song choices and even worse mix choices make Disc 1 a failure.   Disc 2 mixed by The Riddler, also a NYC DJ is a vast improvment and he should be commended on his effort and this just proves not all DJ's from NYC are all bad. Better song choices here more on the Trance side but with enough vocal power to keep you moving. This Disc will be the one you play the most.  But for the money it's still a deal. I've liked Ultra's Trance CD's alot better, but if your looking for real club music stay with a proven winner and check out Ministry Of Sound, you can't go wrong with any of their CD' 
  I enjoyed the Forward to the book. The, albeit, brief reference to 'elegance' being a package - the importance of a great walk and pleasant voice being a given. After the 'Forward' I found the book progressively downhill. Sure, there was the usual worthwhile guidance - the quintessential little black dress, simplicity- less is more and choose quality over quantity - but hardly groundbreaking for anyone with more than a cursory knowledge of fashion. Much of the text stressed silly, outdated and/or erroneous rules- don't wear black in the morning, don't wear bright coloured shoes except in the evening, choose neutral handbags in black and brown (much prefer Kimora's ideas in 'Fabulosity' she suggests choosing handbags in cherry, emerald or orange -let's face it, way more colorful and interesting), women over 21 look better in one piece swimsuits-(surely this is a matter of abdominal firmness- a 40 year old can look stunning in a bikini an overweight 16yr old not so). It went on to refer to Queen Elizabeth as a style icon. As I read the book, I kept seeing glimpses of a girlfriend. She's 40, well groomed, always wears expensive quality clothes but frankly it's all deathly dull - there is no individuality, no surprise in her dress, seems aging- it fits her partner is decades older.  'A Guide To Elegance' focuses on rigidity in fashion (heavy on do's and dont's)which has hopefully been surpassed by CREATIVITY. Interesting, youthful dressing is pleasing at any age and gives vibrancy and youth- my brother in law's mum,70 wore a colorful folk skirt and matching bright shoes to Christmas lunch and looked wonderful. Many readers have commented on compliments when implementing the book but when you give thought and time to your wardrobe, coordinating pieces and ensuring all is clean and fresh, shoes polished etc, hair and make up well done, a great walk and smile and then... irrespective of any supposed 'fashion' book you will indeed be stunning and elegant.            
 I purchased a Fellowes Shredder and felt it shredding money right out of my wallet. If you ever disasmbled a Fellow shredder, you would come to see that they use cheap plastic parts where sturdy mechanical parts made of metal are needed, this is why most of their products fail and their customer service is as good as their cheap parts.  I took mine apart as it was useless and time consuming to deal with returns and their customer service.    There are many other brands of shredders out there and Fellowes is the worst, so save your money and buy another brand.  Fellows is sure no fellow 
 Who would give the green light to this?   It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is  a slight revamp to reflect modern times.   Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie.   "Dawn of the Dead" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances.   Skip this one  
 I wasn't very impressed with this book.  The games for infants suggested are very obvious, common sense ideas, like picking your baby up and flying her in airplane style.  I don't think anyone who has an imagination will  get much new out of this book.  Also, it gives you song lyrics without the  tunes/music, which isn't very helpful.  While there are some good ideas,  they are too few to make this book very worthwhile 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 Joe Nickell is a very interesting character and has, without doubt, a lot of experience in investigation and trickery. He is the perfect sceptic. He also has assumedly a lot a friends in science, who are able to disprove several of his mentioned "alleged supernatural occurrences". So some of the chapters are very interesting and and the solutions he provides are looking plausible (i.e. Nazca Lines). It is fun reading these chapters.  In other cases his attempts to explain the reader, that something is indeed not mysterious or supernatural, is only a listing of assumptions and possible explanations without any scientific evidence (i.e. Wynchester House). I agree to him, that most of the occurences are explainable without the need of some mysterious background. What, in my opinion is a pity, is, that he complains, that most of the cited people have a strong fantasy and are not going to look for scientific explanations, but he is doing the same from his perspective.  In the the whole book I did not find the consideration, that some things are not supernatural, but in our days still mysterious, because our scientifc knowledge lacks of some things not discovered so far or methods not developed, yet. He is only searching for a prove for his doubts and if he cannot find one, claiming that it is disproved with providing a lot of assumptions (fantasy) without any scientifc evidence (i.e. acupucture stated as an example of intuitive healing).  As a good investigator, he should be more open minded to all possibilites and not only focused on trying to disprove everything 
 There is almost no science to back up the author's claims about the benefits of companion plants. Most of her book is based on folk tales, myths and assumptions.   A gentleman named Craig Dremann actually studied the effects of companion plants and concluded that carrots detest tomatoes. Carrots do grow well with garlic and radishes but they grow very poorly with tomatoes. Carrots only grew to 6% of normal when interplanted with tomatoes. Tomatoes grew better with carrots so clearly the tomatoes were robbing nutrients from the carrots. Tomatoes also grow better with garlic but the garlic suffers, only growing 35% of normal.  The Craig Dremann booklet with his findings is called "Companion Plants: Carrots Really Detest Tomaotes" and is available from Redwood City Seed Company in Redwood City, CA 
 WHAT A WASTE OF TAPE  AND TIME THEY PUT INTO THIS MOVIE,  ANYONE WHO SAYS THIS MOVIE IS GREAT NEEDS HEL 
 In order to maintain the legal status of your corporation, you need to pass very specific resolutions and keep very specific records.  I had hoped for a "cookbook" for the legal steps required to set up and operate my corporation, but this is not it.    The info on corporate structures is very basic and general - you could easily find this level of detail on the web.  That's my primary complaint with this book...  it mentions what you must do, but doesn't give you the specifics of how.  Instead of this book, I recommend you:  (1)  Get the *basics* from your lawyer or accountant (or even doing some research on the web)  (2)  buy The Corporate Minutes Book by Anothony Mancuso instead of this book 
 Like almost all rock bands to have formed within the past 10 years, 3 Doors Down is disposable, all their songs sound dull and boring (their all the same too), they belong in the same category as Creed and Nickelback in the "Lullaby Rock" subgenre. It's this kind of stuff, along with emo, Limp Bizkit, and ICP, that is killing rock 
 Extremely dry to watch not really humorus unless you are into very dry humor and I do not think kids are... I bought because I did not know about this video before hand it was in the family kids section in the Borders Book Store. I cannot take it back so what to do with it...UGH! I guess another unused dust collector on my video rack... We decided it was for adults... but then my adult daughter said she did not like it so I guess it is better to know what it is about before buying it 
 Ian Curtis plunges into the depths of post-existential, post-structural connotative ruminations on the implications of our "thrown-ness" (as Heidegger put it) into this world, into its light, its darkness, and the transluscent twilight of the ambiguity we confront as we try to choose between good and evil with nothing to guide us beyond the pull of our compulsive pusilanimity.  Curtis's inept baritone proves the perfect counterpoise for Joy Division's disinterested, motoric rhythms and the barely competent guitar of whatsisname.  All in all, an album for the ages.  The early middle ages, to be precise, during the last few years of Pepin the Short's reign.   More than any band I can think of, Joy Division makes it plain that it's virtually impossible to underestimate the intelligence, or overestimate the gullibility, of Western Man.  There's no arguing about individual taste, or one's ability to perceive the paradox of beauty in ugliness, or any subjective point of view when it comes to this band.  Joy Division is objectively crap.  Musically, lyrically, conceptually, aesthetically, even the production blows.  In 35 years of obsessive record collecting, I've never seen any band even come close to Joy Division when it comes to pulling the wool over peoples' eyes.  Come to think of it, why do you think you never see Ian Curtis and Karl Rove photographed together? 
 The production and performances in 'Final Stab' are good. What brings the movie down is the characters. Within the first 10 minutes of meeting this self-obsessed, apathetic group of characters, I found myself rooting for the killer. The premise of the film is basic and unoriginal. An obnoxious woman (I am being kind) puts together a mystery weekend for her just as obnoxious friends (primarily getting all of them there by extortion). She has hired an actor to play a masked killer for the evening, but alas, a real killer has invaded the evening and they all still think the deaths are just good acting. One of the funniest scenes has the Brittney Spears wannabe approached by the killer, whom she thinks is the actor, and remarks (paraphrased) "Is this going to be messy?". As the killer is stabbing her, her boyfriend is watching from a window and is seriously impressed by her 'good performance'. 'Final Stab' is not poorly made, just poorly conceived. It is difficult to like a film when there are no characters to like. This is too bad, since with some character development and a less disjointed story they could have had a good movie; the basic ingredients were there.--Bo 
 I was GREATLY disappointed in this DVD. Here's why:  1. It's basically 60 minutes of warming up 2. The level 3 (advanced) is not THAT HARD. 3. The annoying "inhale, exhale" chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center.' I just wanted to tell her SHUT UP 4. I didn't break a sweat once.  5. I used it twice and never plan to use it again. I mean, c'mon, I don't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that won't get me results.   I must say the ONLY THING positive about this DVD is the landscape.   In short, rent this from Blockbuster or buy it used. Don't waste any more than 5 bucks on this. It's not worth it.  
 This book and its author's audacious writing style are so intriguing it draws one in despite three warning signs: 1) it's billed as 'post-modernist' which too often means a poor work which is defended on the basis of its detractors being too dull and simple to understand it in all its glory 2) it's historical fiction, which too often means the author is neither creative enough to make up his own story nor skilled enough to make accuracy rewarding and 3) it was recognized by the national book award which too often lately means the public is right for once, the reason only 200 people have read this book is that it's not good.  These telltales notwithstanding the book has the power to fascinate, and readers who hate to give up, or love a challenge, or whose curiosity is powerful will likely press on to see where this careening narrative is headed and be unable to stop - for a while.  Vollmann writes long, confusing, and through varied narrators but in the end this is not Dostoyevsky, Pynchon, or Faulkner.  Vollmann DOES have ability.  It's been pointed out by (just about all) reviewers that the book desperately needed aggressive editing, but reading it makes one think this author's ego would never permit that, so there's probably little hope of him realizing his true potential as a writer.  He certainly didn't with this one. Behind the awards and condescension of its champions this is just a mediocre book that's so so sooooooo long even a sucker for clumsily sprinkled erotica such as myself simply can't stand it 
 Watch the mini series, skip the book.  If you are a fan of history, and I'm certain you are if you're reading this review, skip this book.  Read Rick Atkinson, or Dick Winters' account, anything, just skip this book.  The writing was high school quality, a poor job by the editors (apparently the atomic bomb was "dripped" on Hiroshima), and the story is short on the details that make reading historical accounts interesting.  Enjoy the mini series, but if you're interested in this topic, find another book 
 If you have read Time And Again, you will be extremely disappointed with this sequel. In the first book, Si Morley traveled into the past and there were long passages describing a long gone New York City that were well written and absorbing. Jack Finney tries to duplicate that by again sending Si back and all it comes off as is long winded and boring: an excruciatingly boring buildup just so Finney can introduce Al Jolson; page upon page of boring descriptions of vaudeville, clothing, architecture and early flight are other examples. If I did not know better, I would say that the kernel of this book (returning to the past to prevent WW I) was originally lopped off Time And Again in order to shorten that book and Jack Finney decided to expand it into full book length just to make a fast buck. He would have been better off re-issuing an expanded, "uncut" Time And Again rather than putting out this drivel 
 I guess it's still true (to some degree anyway) that being a MOVIE STAR has more, uh, cachet to it than being a TV actor.  But sometimes you have to wonder why.  Watching this mediocre-at-best 1994 effort featuring former TV star Woody Harrelson, future TV leads Kiefer Sutherland and Dylan McDermott, you just might wonder why that's the case.  These actors can all be justifiably proud of their work on (respectively) CHEERS, 24, and THE PRACTICE.  I can't imagine that they bring up this film much in conversation as being one of the highlights of their careers.  Which is not to say that they don't all give it their best shot.  As our cowboys-loosed-in-the-Big-Apple heroes, Sutherland and Harrelson are affable enough.  And it's interesting to see McDermott take on a menacing villain's role.  But otherwise, this movie is pretty predictable "fish out of water" fare.  And speaking of TV shows, didn't Dennis Weaver pretty much mine all the possibilities of out of that particular plotline decades ago on McCLOUD?    Of course, McCloud never resorted to such grotesqueries as we witness in the "hungry calf" scene.  Even in the new millennium, television seldom stoops quite THAT low. The filmmakers must have been getting a little desperate at that point.  I believe this is what's known as "jumping the shark."  Or some variation on that phrase involving a "calf."  One shudders to think 
 Paranoid and partisan? You bet. Another book added to the long list of fruitcake conspiracy offerings 
 This story has been done time and time again.  Don't waste your money.  Humor was forced and trite, book was way too long 
 Like others, I have read the whole Goldy Bear Culinary Mystery series and I have enjoyed each book...until now.  This book is slow to start and as I am only on page 100 after a week, hasn't picked up speed yet.  I can't get past Goldy wallowing in her sorrow.  Granted, I have never tripped over a dead body only to find out that it was my neighbor, but enough is enough already.   As another reader mentioned, there are a few disjointed parts for example, at one point Marla is driving Goldy to pick up Arch and Gus.  A couple of paragraphs later, Goldy is turning into the parking lot...but I thought Marla was driving???  I hope that this book was a fluke and Diane Mott Davidson will come back with a mystery of the same caliber that all of her fans have come to expect and enjoy 
 My mother (she's a great grandmother) bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  Unfortunately, at her age, she forgets to keep receipts.  This item did not even work for two days.  When I returned after Christmas, I tried to return it but could only exchange because the packaging had been thrown away. The second Video Jr. Now continually skips if you just bump it.  I can never find any new discs at Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, or anywhere else.  I put in a complaint to Hasbro/Playskool but I have never received any response back as to how to return it.  I mean, it cost $40.00 and it's not worth it.  I would not recommend anyone paying for something that doesn't last long.  
 I think that the book had lots of cute ideas but they all require lots of separate materials that I did not already have in my vast collection of cardmaking and scrapbooking supplies. You could use the basic ideas and modify them to make your own cards though 
 This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
 I have enjoyed every installment of this series except the latest edition. I could never get into the plot and left the book wondering if it was even written by the same author. Instead of the smooth flowing writing I am used to it was very difficult to follow and had radical character departures from usual behavior with very sloppy hasty justification. This appears to be a rough draft not a finished product. I am very disappointed 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 Let me first say that once upon a time I liked Larry The Cable Guy.  After reading this book, I now think he is one step above slime. To be fair, some jokes ARE funny and some stories ARE enjoyable and amusing.  He is anti-PC which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Moore, Barney Frank, Barbara Streisand, and "that fat girl from the Dixie Chicks", among others.  No problem there in my opinion. That is the entirety of the positive things I can say about the book.  The rest is just babble, often repeated over and over again, that even Larry lovers will find annoying.  A couple things that really bothered me.  The first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of "retards" and Down's Syndrome children.  He must use the term "retard" at least fifty+ times in the book.  This is appreciably different than making a joke about, say, Michael Moore.  Moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes.  The Down's Syndrome children did not. My opinion of Larry The Cable Guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on "retards".  He also racially sterotypes in the book.  Many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond.  The Down's Syndrome kids can't.  Larry, I can only hope God (in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book) grants you a "retard" child to love and care for.  Then, I would like to read your next book. I suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly.  The second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that Larry is a fraud in many senses.  He plays the good 'ol Bubba. He ain't too bright and he ain't ever changed since he left the farm.  His "celebrity" - his word not mine - has not gone to his head. OK, Larry. Why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures, including serious topics such as abortion?  Why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down?  Why the unrelenting references to your "celebrity"?  The terms "meet and greet" and "after-party" were used over and over and over, as an example.  Do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are?  Well, you are wrong.  They are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become.  That's Hollywood-speak my country, fart loving, nose picking friend.  Overall, this book is a true disappointment and Larry The Cable Guy is a true moron (see doesn't that sound better than "retard").    My Father always taught me there are two types of dumb people.  Those who are dumb and know they are dumb.  And those who are dumb but are so dumb, they don't realize it.  The former category usually shuts up (knowing they are dumb).  The latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter. The first group is obviously smarter than the second.  Larry The Cable Guy falls smack dab in the last group.  The fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book. Make jokes, Larry, and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like.  Unfortunately, Larry can't see the obvious.  Like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book, he has become exactly one of them.  A thin layer of "Good 'Ol Boy" on top, covering a core of venom and "celebrity". He plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets.  My suggestion: Don't buy Larry's act and, by all means, don't buy the book.   
 Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of "Raise the Titanic", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent. Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved. Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 My son who's 6 just received this Playhut for his birthday and it looked like a really neat idea before I set it up. It's extremely flimsy, does not want to stay up, the tent space is TINY and the sleeping bag is extremely thin. All in all, it's a total waste of money, unfortunately I can't take it back because it's a gift 
 This was just a boring movie...can't understand the other review's saying it's good. Wouldn't reccomend it 
 I liked the idea of replacing social security, medicare, and medicaid with a $10,000 a year grant. Then I ran some numbers in my head.  US GDP runs at about 12 trillion. There are 300 million people in the United States. 300 Million times $10,000 = 3 Trillion (Yes, I know that not all people in the population get the grant, but bear with me.)  US govenement revenue in 2005 was on the order of $2.5 trillion. The book claims that the $10,000 will eventually be cheaper than payments to these things.  I suppose it may be, but I would see that as an indicator that we are going to be doomed to spend less on these programs in the future than we are now. Not that we can replace them with something that will already cost more that all of government does already.  Another sticking point -- Murray is supposed to be a libertarian (with at least a lower case l) Yet he advocates replacing existing government socialized medicine systems by requiring insurance companies to insure everyone regardless of pre-exisiting conditions, and then requiring everyone to buy insurance. This strikes me as being an awful lot like socialized medicine. Murray at least commits a mild offense by seeming to suggest that one can plan a market.  Murray's chapters on the social implications of the plan versus the existing system are rife with pure speculation. Murray blames all of the social ills -- real and imaginary -- on the welfare state. Does he really believe that the welfare state has caused there to be more extramarital sex, and that the invention of the birth control pill has nothing to do with it? It seems like if it rains on Murray's birthday, it's to be blamed on the welfare state.   I do like the idea of replacing some of these social programs with a grant as Murray describes. I do believe that there will be some positive effects (mostly in the removal of government inefficiencies) of doing so. But the numbers will have to be toned down to provide any sort of realistic numbers for the future. 
 Finally, when it actually WAS over a year since I had received the coffeemaker, when I called to check on the status of my warranty claim, they said, "Your warranty has expired. You've had this coffeemaker over one year. There is nothing we can do." I highly recommend you find a coffeemaker from a manufacturer that stands behind their product! I have a Cuisinart now, and it is WONDERFUL! 
 Someone below me called this guy the king of New York? What are you thinking? There has not been a rapper from NYC this bad...forever. I really don't like him, and I think that his music is overrated 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 I ordered this ram two weeks ago! They haven't even shipped it yet 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money. 
 Mr. Das (aka Jeff) seems to enjoy dragging the reader through as much suffering as he can recall. That appears to be his main point. The text is scattered with no logical order.  Frank Hazelwood 
 A poor book. Sophomorically written, better suited to youngsters. The author has a poor knowledge of the Third Reich and is heavily biased against Germans of that era. If you are interested in Hanna Reitsch find a copy of her autobiography FLYING IS MY LIFE 
 not update info on the epic characters ofthe realms  could have used some more umph like epic spells and the lik 
 This album is mainly for big time guitar fans. Of course Robben Ford is a very talented guitar player but I find this one rather slow and very boring. I can hear one or two songs at a time, then I just can't stand it! The music of Robben Ford is a blend of blues, jazz, funk, and I'm almost certain that most of his fans are guitar players themselves. I'd buy "Handful of blues" instead of this one 
 I felt ambushed by T. Sturgeon after I finished this book. It starts out as a fun, interesting time-travel adventure, but as the novel goes on, you get the uncomfortable sensation that Sturgeon has a sexual/gender agenda, and he certainly does. I liked a lot of the inventiveness of the little bubble-world, but stepping back from the book afterwords, it really is a perverse little bubble world. After finishing the book I went back and read his introduction, and Sturgeon strikes me as a bit of a nasty man. And what was the deal with the ending? Was that actually a nuclear war that was dropped like an A-bomb on the final page for no reason other than send the reader off with a bad feeling?? I'll give it two stars for colorful scenes and events but I felt Sturgeon purposely laid a downer on me 
 BEWARE. First of all, let me say that I am a big Vernor Vinge fan. I have read and loved most of his work. So when I saw that this novel was coming out early this year (2006), I ordered it sight unseen. However, as it turns out, this is NOT a new book. It is a reprinting of an older novel. And, it is NOT science fiction - it is fantasy? What, Vernor Vinge?? Yup, fantasy. If I was jaded, I would say that this is a sneaky ploy on the part of Professor Vinge's publisher to make a fast buck. My advice - leave this old mummy be and read another Charles Scheffield or Greg Egan novel 
 After reading five of her novels, I have become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I will admit (and this probably proves that I am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself) that I've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that didn't make it on the list.   Initially I liked the book and it kept me reading, though maybe just out of habit. I enjoyed reading about the Amish way of life and the Amish traditions - though it did make me think of that Harrison Ford movie, Witness (circa 1989 or something). I like that she used one first person voice as well as the third person narrative in a well crafted and varied way.  I like that her main character has a powerful job that challenges gender stereotypes by being the morally questionable lawyer. That being said, she doesn't explore this as well as she could. We sort of forget that Ellie has blatantly suppressed evidence and watched as little girls saw their rapist acquitted. Rape, she can defend, but infanticide creates some problems for the notorious defense attorney.   Something about the book bothered me. Maybe I am reading too many of her books too fast but I am seeing a formula here.  - Many of her plots include a court room drama.  - All of her plots feature romance or end with the obvious potential for one.  - Mothers and their powerful (all encompassing, self-sacrificing) love for their children are a theme in all of her books I've read.  - There is usually a "twist" at the end. She's becoming Koontz like in her formulaic predictability and I stopped reading his novels as a teenager.  Most of her books left me content, like I'd eaten a good, hearty meal. However, this book left me hungry and searching for critical reviews to see if others shared my dissatisfaction.   So: - I was unimpressed with the "twist" at the end of this one - I knew "whodunit" about 1/2 of the way through. I was getting bored with that part of the story. The red herrings are too obvious and her suggestions that Katie didn't do it were there from the beginning. She should've stopped the heavy handed attempt to make us question that and just made it known through the 3 person narrative exactly who did the killing or hiding. Then she could have explored that character in depth instead of hiding her and others she wanted you to be suspicious about. Just because we, the readers knew, didn't mean that Ellie had to know - or anyone else for that matter.   - The characters in this novel were a tad generic. I am sorry, I like her, but they were boring.   For instance, I was bored with Ellie's dilemma over Coop - to the point where I often skipped the interaction they had when they discussed their potential future together. Duh, I knew they were going to get together after a little drama from Ellie through which Coop - being the quintessential "sensitive ponytail guy" - would wait, albeit in pain. It was just too predictable.  Hannah's ghost; she has a ghost hunter in a later novel and I was a disappointed to see another one. But other than that, Hannah's ghost seems a bizarre and meaningless addition. Is it to suggest that she, Katie, might be crazy and a murderer? Is it to explain why she was so drawn to Adam? Katie being the good Amish girl could only fall for someone who could share her secret ability to see her sister... In a book that is so Amishly pragmatic and logical in every other way makes it so the supernatural element clashes with the rest of the novel. Maybe Hannah's ghost killed Katie's baby or hid it.  I liked the details. The Amish and their daily lives, those who assimilate and those who don't, and how the religion and way of life affect one's thinking offers a neat, un-scholarly insight into a different culture. I liked the culture clashes and I wondered how they would be resolved. But what I did like, doesn't measure against my dissatisfaction.  My most recent book purchase included three works of fiction; two by Picoult and one by Atwood. I think I'll shelve the unread Picoult for a while. I'll have some time to forget her modus operandi. I'll read the Atwood and then I'll buy a book by a different author 
 Gosman's book is really bad.  He has one idea, and he repeats it over and over -- you can guess what it is.  The book is stuffed with obviously fake examples of the problem he claims to be highlighting, and has now turned into a mini-industry, and the writing is straight out of magazine articles from the 1950s.  He has no actual training in what he writes about, nor is he a professional.  He really seems to hate children, and this is a constant presence in the book.  Reading it will leave you with a little bit of a headache, and the idea that children today are basically evil, materialistic monsters.  Particularly irritating are the endless references to how things used to be, when kids were __________ (fill in the blank: more respectful, kinder, less materialistic, more hardworking, whatever).  Dumb, obvious, and nasty 
 This book gives just a general overview of cat care.  It is good if you have never owned a cat before and need just general info.  I was disappointed because it didn't give many specifics on Persian cats 
 I received this tablet and it looked real good I loved it --I pluged it in to the computer and put CD's in and nothing--the CD's did nothing the WACOM tablet doesn't work so here I am with the tablet the mouse and the pen sitting by my computer and out the money wondering why I even bothered buying this thing in the first place -don't try it because you might just get I did --a WACOM tablet that doesn't work and then you are out the money plus  figuring  out how to get your money back or how to get in touch with the sellers!!  I have tried and there are no answers anywhere there are no phone numbers to call for help---no numbers for trouble shooting you are on your own no return numbers or adresses you are left with this so think again before you waste your mone 
 The Mysteries of Udolpho is beautifully written.  Ann Radcliffe writes page after page, after page...of picturesque descriptions of Italy and France's countryside.   That being said, I found The Mysteries of Udolpho to be long winded and drawn out.  The first two volumes are rather mind-numbing and I skimmed over much of it.  I never felt a connection towards Emily and felt rather indifferent towards her well being.  I found her to be rather insipid and became tired of her constant fits of weeping and fainting.  Her servant, Annette, was more intriguing than Emily and her pathetic weakness. I would personally recommend skipping The Mysteries of Udolpho to read Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Uncle Silas.  Young Maud finds herself in similiar circumstances but approaches them with not only grace and sweetnss but a strength that she "finds from a place unknown" to herself.  You will cheer for Maud in a way that seems impossible to do for Emily 
 Title says it all.  I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series.  Forth book sort of dragged.  By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel.  Let's face it, life's too short.  If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of "The Stand".  I'm afraid this doesn't do it.    Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?  Cheer 
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
  The Million Dollar Baby was a bummer. I mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book. The only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story Million Dollar Baby. The only reason why that is good because it's just like the movie and the movie is great.   The Monkey Look, Black Jew , Rope Burns etc. are about 25-30 pages a peace and they don't keep you into the book as others.The Movie is the only Millin Dollar Baby anything i would waste my time on.   
 Tedious, boring.  The promise of what could have been a great story is, sadly, a wasted vision.  The few times it looked like a character or plot line was going someplace interesting, the author switched gears and when she did get back to the "what happend" part of a scenario, I was dissatisfied.  Plot lines dissolved into something vague or just left me with a feeling of "who cares"?.  I paid $2.00 for this book in a bargain bin and should have folded the bills into little paper boats and floated them in a rain-soaked gutter instead.  Would have been a lot more fun and a better use of money 
 I cannot say I enjoyed this book, largely because the main character, Joseph Reaveley, seemed to me to be self-absorbed and oddly moralistic in his approach to the horrors of war and the challenge of defending what often seems entirely indefensible. For example, there is the rotten war correspondent who forces (though heaven knows why) a courtmartial of a poor wounded soldier who may or may not have deliberately maimed himself to get out of the trenches and tunnels he was wounded in. It is never quite clear why in the face of no evidence of self-mutilation this fellow is courtmartialed and possibly (we never know) likely to be hung. It is, apparently, because, morality and honor require this??? Then, when this same correspondent turns up dead (with everyone thinking it couldn't have happened to a nicer fellow)- Saint Chaplain Reavely takes it upon himself to find out if he was murdered and if so, by whom. This, in the midst of trench warfare, poison gas - and then the idiocy of Gallipoli - where Joseph appears to confront another war correspondent who thinks the stupidity of that battle should be reported. Oh no, says our Joseph who is horrified that anyone in England should know of this - and tries to stop him - risking his own death (how incredibly brave) as well as that of another poor wounded fellow who, of course, is ready and willing  to die, because Joseph knows best. Then, of course, there is Joseph's moral outrage at his sister who is chastely yearning for a General, and his "courageous" decision to ruin his best friend's life because doing so is "the morally defensible and right thing to do" despite the fact that Joe knows what his friend did was necessary to save England from the truth of the horrors of war. Really?  This was the most disappointing of this series. Joe's previous moralizing was a bit much - but tolerable. This one was way over the top and thoroughly unbelievable 
 The cover of this film says "If you loved THE MISSION and THE APOSTLE(which I did!) then you will LOVE MOLOKAI!"........Sorry....I didn't!This film cannot even begin to be compared with those wonderful films.Paul Cox's direction of such talent as Sir Derek Jacobi and Peter O'Toole is an utter travesty.David Wenham is positively laughable as Father Damien.The screenplay dialogue is sheer dribble and the film is as static as static can be.What SHOULD have been a riveting retelling of Hawaii's "dirty little secret" is reduced to pure nonsense and cliche deplorably acted by all parties.Even the breathtaking cinematography of the Hawaiian Islands (which was minimal at best) could not bring salvation to  this leperous bore!Even the film BLACKROBE was better than this 
 Words need not even be wasted on this product. Besides each character having a different voice than that in the movie, the audio effects are terrible, as well as the actors and script. The one good thing about this product is its availability is limited. Save your time, save your money. Don't let Lucas put his hand in your pocket 
 I have practiced Thai Chi and Qi Gong for 12 years and I am very familiar with the movement of energy (chi) within the body. Mantak Chia tried to present on several pages philosophy and practices which take at least 4 MONTHS to master under the guidance of an experienced instructor. Anyone who tries to convince you that you can master such techniques in less than an hour definitely lies you!   The author knows how dangerous is to deal with energy without knowing in great details how to control and direct it. That's why if you are also interested in such exoteric practices I strongly recommend you to find an instructor. In this way you will avoid several potentially dangerous problems for your health, which are listed on 2 pages in the book. This is serious and your health and well-being are your responsibility!   I know how to circulate the energy in my body but I couldn't enjoy even once "multiple orgasms" in this way. Actually, it is not that much connected with circulation of energy but with your PC muscle and squeezing it right before an ejaculation. I hope that someone will have better luck than me 
 This stuff is a waste of money. It is too sticky to do anything with. I threw it all away and the kids didn't even care. Lousy product 
 This planner is pretty poorly organized.  For example, the section on announcing your engagement (which one might expect to be in the first chapter) isn't until Chapter 4.  Setting the date is in Chapter 3, after you've already read about selecting your wedding party in Chapter 2.  It doesn't make much sense to choose your attendants before you even have a date, so why organize the book that way?  There also wasn't much new information in the book that I hadn't read somewhere else before.  However, the checklists seem somewhat useful; I've only used the budget checklist so far.  There are no pockets to hold business cards or contracts or notes, a definite drawback. If you have State Farm insurance, you can get a special edition of this book for free through your insurance agent.  It sure beats paying 20 bucks for a mostly useless planner 
 what's that book about? rebellion? i don't think to be a rebel is necessary to have sex with everyone you meet, both male and female. is the intent of the author to shock you? he didn't shock me, he just disgusted me.  i didn't like this book at all, and if you are looking for a book with a meaning, you won't like this one 
 The "active liberty" advocated by Justice Breyer is another term for "passive tyranny."  He substitutes his own personal moral judgment as opposed to ruling on the text of the Constitution.  I don't care how Justice Breyer feels about an issue. A judge should not impose a moral viewpoint when the text of a law is silent.  The Constitution can be amended as it has been 27 times before.  But amendments are difficult to pass, as they should be, and those of Justice Breyer's political philosophy do not trust the people to get it right so they create terms like active liberty to confuse the uninformed.  For those who agree with Justice Breyer I would like to play them in poker, with "active rules" which "grow" and "evolve" during the course of the game so that I can win every hand.  You would be a fool to agree to play a game of poker with evolving rules and likewise should reject Justice Breyer's notions of "passive tyranny. 
 I remember reading about this album in Rolling Stone.  It had 2 stickers on it.  It had the usual "parental advisory" sticker (is there a rap album that doesn't) and another one saying "the lyrical content on this album strictly represents the views of the artist" (or words to that effect).  The article's main point was asking "are albums going to get two labels now?  What's next?".  So, my "I hate censorship" side got all flustered, and I went out and bought it.  It's a piece of s--t.  The beats are boring, and all the lyrics seem to consist of is "my name MC Eiht.  No one better mess with me".  He pads this wonderfully original thought out to 70 minutes or so, and it gets incredibly tedious.  Needless to say, the sticker "controversy" never erupted into anything beyond this album.  I just ended buying a really boring album, and I immediately got rid of it.  
 I am very upset - I bought all three and no onscreen lyrics - why would I buy a karaoke cd without them? I feel that I just wasted 41 dollars 
 As with most reviews below, Pavel is more of a salesman than author.  Overpriced books that have more ad text than information.  There is a line between being a "positive" coach and a coach with an ego.  Pavel travels way past that line, so much that you get mad at him (and yourself for spending too much money).  VERY LITTLE worthwhile infomation but try to buy it used or way below cost 
 When trying to download information to the Ipod, I keep getting error messages reading Ipod is corrupt and it asks me to restore the Ipod.  Sometimes the software will recognize the Ipod and other times it won't.  I have installed and reinstalled the software several times, but it does not seem to fix the problem.  
 This is a tabloid, so most likely the stories you're reading are not true. Why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that, a rumor 
 I found this C.D. to be horrible mainly becuase she just doesn't have the voice and is not ready to be a singer quite yet. Maybe in the future she will be better, but right now she needs a lot of practic 
 What I really didn't like about this book is the constant rambling after starting the topic sentence in a paragraph.  Which never concluded any information on the topic.  Then instead of going over all the variations of an approach, he makes it quite clear that this should be the method for every bowler.  In my opinion bowling involves individuals, and on mans view will not work for every bowler.  It would be more helpful if he used his insight in bowling on how to work with the different variations that you can see in bowling 
 The author states (p.330) regarding "Darwinism--adaptation brought about by natural selection": "Whether we like it or not, we are stuck with it. The Darwinian revolution is over, and Darwin won."  He goes on to say that any satisfactory response must hence be on Darwinian terms, "adaptation, selection, blind variation..." The last of these, also known as random mutation, is of course how according to Darwin live organisms obtain the form that allows them to survive. As I tried in other reviews here (and am dealing with fully in my own book), I am presently again trying to convey that this focus on the organism's form stems from a misguided analogy between humanly produced functional artifacts and the functionality of organisms. It was argued in defense of intention in the organism's form that just as man-made artifacts are in their functions produced intentionally by an intelligent designer, so must organisms in their functions be the intentional product of intelligence.  And the dispute is well known to be about whether or not organisms, too, were formed intentionally, by way of a goal-directed process.    The mistake is that the goal-directedness or its absence is looked for in the wrong area. While there may be difficulties in showing whether organismic forms came about by plan or by accident, there is no difficulty at all in seeing instead that it is the organism's activities that are indeed goal-directed. For this evidence of preponderant goal-directedness in the living--their aim of self-preservation--which stares us straight in the face, there appears to be a complete blind spot. On recognizing this, the consequence is that Darwinism, contending the same aimlessness in organisms as in other natural events, is false. Yet Darwin is doggedly followed in science and praised to high heaven, with the author of the now reviewed book calling him a genius (p.109). Let me accordingly comment briefly on how original is Darwin's thinking.  Inasmuch as natural selection is in essence the environment's influence on the organism, the influence occurring in any case, the main point of Darwin is that organisms become adapted to the environment by accident rather than by aim. And it is obvious that for any chance of that to happen, supposing it possible at all, there must be enormous multitudes of variations as claimed, the thought requiring no new idea.  The subsequent thinking then has had to be preoccupied with seeking explanations of how the wrongly hypothesized chance adaptations occur. 
 Denzel Washington is probably my favorite actor. Even in that dog of a movie called THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, he shone. Tom Hanks? Well, lemme quit hating the guy. This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a Latino, after all.   Actually, this is a Hollywood "message movie," and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as far away from it as possible.   There's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way they stared at him reminded me of "lao wei in China" experiences. Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks' character.   AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got.   As a totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name "Sam Francisco" means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on discrimination.   I love a great courtroom drama. This one was merely good. With so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film, they had to take a few shortcuts here. Sad, ain't it? But even so, a well-intentioned film that I'm glad I saw. Once. Not twice. Once is enough, thank you.    
 The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.  Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time 
 The Order sheds light on a religious sect dating back to the Crusades.  Having survived throughout the centuries, it aims at fulfilling a prophecy, which would plunge mankind into a third world war...   In short, the acting and the dialogues are extremely weak (Van Damme and Charlton Heston really disappoint with their performances!), while the plot and the setting, are actually very good, therefore, the potential for a great movie was definitely there if only the actors and writers could... act and write!  As for the rating, if you're going to have it rated R at least give it the sex and/or the violence.  If not, give it the proper rating i.e. PG-13. Overall, far from being a masterpiece, it just might provide for an evening's entertainment if in a really silly mood and/or intoxicated. 1½  Stars If Van Damme movies is what you had in mind, check out the Legionnaire and Timecop 
 after few months of using it, it started to lag badly, and the scroll wheel stopped working, I'll never buy logitech mouse again. 
 I was very disappointed that the songs on this album were not a comprehensive list of the songs that I saw in the movie. It's a compilation of mediocre songs. Big disappointment 
 Instead of being named "AC and the Age of Steel," it should have been named "The Age of Steel with Andrew Carnegie."  This documentary is more about steel than this famous rich guy.  They don't even bring up Carnegie until one-fifth of the way into the work.  They show about two photos of him and that's all.  You never learn if he went to college, what charities he supported, or how he died.  They show a photo of Carnegie with a man I believe to be Booker T. Washington.  Did Carnegie support Black colleges or other African-American causes of the time?  This work never answers:  all it does is focus on steel.  I can't believe that the History Channel actually thought a marketable number of people would want to know about that.  Leave that boring stuff in an engineering classroom!  I liked that the interviewees came from a diverse range of universities in the South and North.  I hate that I'm buying into ideas that only "great men" are worthy of historical works.  But still, yawn!  I was left very disappointed 
 I read this for my M.A. in History, now I know why I never read it as a undergrad. It is a bit drawn out. I like Morgan, he is very interesting and I would say the same thing about Winthrop. But like Morgan sometimes does, he draws out Winthrop's story so much that you begin to forget what the original thesis was, a people striving to be perfect in an imperfect world. Morgan's thesis would have worked much more effectively as a Journal Article in the Journal of New England History. Although, Morgan's thesis might have been ground breaking in the 1960's, it is hardly earth shattering today. I didn't feel anymore educated about Puritans than I was before. It is a good book to reflect on how historians thought about 17th century New England before the 1960's but I didn't see much use for it beyond that. Morgan has made a fine argument, it is just too bad that it was so long winded that it could have been summed up in a journal entry 
 I am a huge fan of Umberto Eco, and his novels (Rose and Foucault's Pendulum) and I had high hopes for this collection of essays. Eco is very satirical in these essays, sometimes too much so; the satirical and exaggerating style that is combined with very unusual translation style (ancient words that do not reach the nice rhythm of Eco's otherwise great storytellin in his other works) just got me tired of reading this book. These stories just do not entertain me this time.  Here and there I was able to find a nice story but only few. Language just doesn't get to its pace, and I also have say that majority of the stories are dated for readers in 2006. Stories about telefaxes, etc. are not relevant anymore. But also the general problem of satirical essays is that they are very much tied to the present day when they're written.  Overall, not a bad collection but nowhere near to my expectations 
 This book is for the Goth Fluffy Bunny. If you are into the White-lighter, Fluffy Bunny, New Age,Goth then this is the book for you! Everyone else will want to keep looking, I wish I did. 
 "You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing" is what he said. Hiroshima Mon Amour depicts the reality of the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place on August 6, 1945.  The story begins with two bodies against each other with multiple clips of the results of the bombing.  When I watched this movie for the first time, I realized this movie was far from a fairy tale.  Instead, this movie captured reality and could be described as the "fiction" aspect of history William Gass explains in "The Nature of Narrative".  Throughout the entire movie the main character, a woman from France explains the hardships she went through back at home.  It was disturbing for me to watch the movie as it went back in time where she was taunted for have been in love with a German soldier.  I felt it violated a person's right as to whom he/she may date.  It was also unbearable to watch the clips where it shows the end results after the bombing of Hiroshima.  The fact that this movie was made in 1959 the black and white picture made it difficult for me to read the subtitles.  Lastly, the one thing I must question about this movie is the fact that it was told in French.  I couldn't help but get frustrated that the movie started from an awkward stage of the overall story.  It seems as though it skipped the introduction and went straight into the rising of the climax.  I didn't like that they both speak of the war with no clear explanation as to what they're really talking about.  If a person who was completely oblivious about the history of Hiroshima were to watch this movie, he/she that's watching would have a hard time comprehending the overall point of the movie.  
 back and forth and back and forth.  im happy.  im sad.  happy.  sad.  love him.  dont love him.  love him.  dont blah. blah blah.  we're poor.  we're not poor.  we're poor.   a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.  malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).    spoiler    he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok!  (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no.  when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok.  the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad.  in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)     
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 After 18 months over dating , I thought I would give this book to my boyfriend in hopes he could come to a decision about marriage or the possibility in the following year.Before this everything was fine!After I put this PRESSURE on him to think about what he wants, etc. He BOLTED and cheated on me- something that is not even natural for him out of total fear!I think the realtionship is over for good now because I could not wait until HE WAS READY to do this on his own- Don't make the same mistakes I did- throw out "the Rules" and these other manipulative this that tell you how to make a man marry you and give ultimatums. Any time you use these tactics you are taking a risk they will backfire on you. I would do anything to take back what I did, but it is to late (probably) and I will have to learn from my mistakes 
 While I Was Gone, by Sue Miller, reads suspiciously like a blend of the steadily increasing numbers of this genre of WASP apologist novels. To my jaded eyes, these offensively scrupulous tales appear to be written for WASP C Average women college graduates of A plus incomes.  I am certain that many of these readers will consider themselves more well-read and better understood for having consumed a stack of this stuff by similar writers. Somehow, WASPS everywhere will feel that instead of being emotionally constipated and terminally civilized, that they are, as usual, better than everyone else who isn't like them.  The characters, including the animals, are for the most part, good-looking, privileged, educated, and eminently acceptable. Suspension of disbelief is just not happening here. This novel pays some token hommage to the strife of teenage parenting and the shoals of marriage. Yet, it remains smug and self-satisfied conveying beyond a shadow of a doubt that these superior folks are going to soldier on and become even better than they already are for having erred on the side of humanity.  Ugh! Just once it would have been nice to experience a character like Jo screaming at her minister husband Daniel to cease his sadistic sanctimonius silent cruelty and put himself in her place. Alas, no, that sort of low-class behaviour can never exist in the rarified world of the dazzlingly narcissictic humble.  I would exhort Sue Miller to redeem herself by writing about some low-born WASPS who know how to crochet toilet roll covers and make gloppy casseroles while drowning in some decently offensive hypocracy 
 As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who "ruined" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.  Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).  Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see 
 The only reason you would need cliff notes for this book is if you are lazy or short on time and theres a test the next day.  Yet the cliff notes arent descriptive enough for you to get the whole book.  I can understand needing cliff notes for the confusing dialect of "tale of two cities", or the background and analysis for "Brave new World", but going through the Catcher in the Rye is a breeze, and the book is enjoyable.  Its one of my favorite books ever.  Dont even bother with these cliff notes 
 Starforce....nothing else need be said. Starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of "could be" great games...I don't know since not a single one will play on a Dell XPS "Gaming" Laptop 
 Who open scroll always profit says an ancient Chinese motto. The same applies to books. I profited from reading this one, but I didn't profit much or enough. The work is uneven and needs focus. The title is poor because it misnames the subject of the book which is, incidentally, not how to win an anrgument, but how to think clearly. Some of the author's points would have passed me by and probably other points would have been downright confusing had I not had a background in logic. And one wonders about a book on the Art of Deception deceiving people into believing that the book is one thing when it is really about something else. Perhaps some well meaning editior or PR person mispersuaded the author to use this fake and phony title in the hope of increased sales. A few bones: I don't like the word argument because of its two meanings. Demonstration is better. The formal analysis of arguments (my demonstrations) in chapter three hits the reader on the head: Although it is technically correct, without a background in formal logic you might get lost fast. The chapter could have done better explaining the differences between contraries and contradictions and the reasons for the other errors which are never clearly stated. The author just assumes the reader will get it when I have a feeling derived from teaching logic for years that they won't and don't. For intstance, why the undistributed middle term invalidates a proof is clear to me only because I knew it from previous studies, and thought long and hard about it, not from what the author says here in his book. And the worst sin of all: Somewhere in the middle of the discussion of groupthink, the author seems to get bored with his own discussion. No wonder the reader nods off. Those interested in improving their critical thinking should read Asking the Right Questions. Those interested in understanding errors in logic might consult The Art of Argument by St. Aubyn, a book that hits hard where we need improvement by showing us the common errors of thinking of overgeneralization, false analogy, vague definition, and partial selection of the evidence 
 Just not my cup of tea.  Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 I've always been a casual fan of the Talking Heads. I liked their music, but only had a few of their CD's, so I decided to treat myself to this set which I thought would be comprehensive. Well, upon receiving this mess of a "box  set" I was so taken aback that it took me a while to get to the music.  The "box" is actually a rectangular book with fairly bizarre and unappealing art. (Nudes that represent... what?) The book itself, because of its shape, does not lend itself to easy reading, and while the contents are of a decent quality, some artist appreciations by the likes of Rick Moody and commentary by the band members,some intersting curios, like notes and original lyric sheets, and a discography, trying to read this while hoping the binding holds up while the pages flop all over the place is quite a feat.  The music itself is a decent overview of the band's work. The three CD's have a nice cross section of the band's work, but for the cost and the annoying packaging, I would have been much better off with SAND IN THE VASELINE 
 This book is for a more established professional, and not for one interested in the fashion industy. It was very hard to understand to me since I am a novice at applying makeup. This book is not worth the price 
 Sir Leycester Coltman was Head of the Foreign Office's Latin America Department, then Ambassador to Cuba (1991-94), then to Colombia (1994-98). But as this mean-minded book shows, this hardly qualified him to write `the real' biography of Fidel Castro.   This book gives the Foreign Office view, brimming with anti-trade union, anti-national and anti-communist sneers. For example, he casts doubts on Fidel's brother's parentage, citing as evidence Raul's `slanted oriental eyes', but even the book's photos disprove this.   Coltman patronisingly assumes that Britain can give lessons in democracy to Cuba, but how many of us voted Mandelson an EU Commissioner? Coltman smugly assumes that capitalism means progress, but capitalism, a mode of production, does not make technological innovations or scientific advances: the working class makes them all. He cannot describe US imperialism and the illegal US blockade without putting the offending words in inverted commas.  He claims that the Macmillan government's decision to sell the Cuban dictator Batista warplanes and tanks was `commercial rather than political', because Britain's economic situation was `desperate'.  When Macmillan refused to sell Hawker Hunter fighters to Castro to defend Cuba against imminent US aggression, the situation was presumably not so desperate. Kennedy's illegal assault on Cuba showed that Bush's practice of unilateral, aggressive war is nothing new.  Cuba's eight million people have sustained independence and sovereignty, repelling all efforts to interfere in their internal affairs. So Fidel rightly opposed the Sandinistas' 1989 decision to bow to US-EU demands to hold multi-party elections in Nicaragua: the Sandinistas even let the US government fund the opposition.   He warned, "Some people think they can save socialism by making concessions. They fail to take account of the voracious mentality of imperialism and of the reactionary forces. If you give them part of a fingernail, they will want part of your finger; if you give them a piece, they will want the whole finger; if you give them the finger, they will ask for the forearm; if you give them the forearm, they will ask for the arm; and when you give them the arm, they will chop off your head."  
 I've been saying for a long time that New Yorker cartoons aren't actually as funny as people assume they are. An awful lot of them are either based on lame topical references, or try to squeeze yet another laugh out of tired material like stuffy businessmen and marital squabbles. And the current crop of cartoonists aren't even all that good at drawing -- lots of little people with little heads, mostly. (I do love William Haefeli, though.)  But I've always wanted to see more cartoons from the early period, so going through the book in chronological order was a fascinating experience. The cartoons of the 20's in particular were a revelation: so much great drawing, in an amazing variety of styles.   As the decades wear on, though, it's depressing to see the sheer fun of the earlier cartoons slowly being bled away. I think the decisive break came during the 60's, just about at the end of the first CD. Since then, with the exception of a few first-rate talents like Steinberg, Steig, Hamilton, Booth, and Lorenz (very underappreciated), the quality of the drawing has deteriorated while the humor has gone nowhere.  And this during a period when the art of cartooning went in some fascinating new directions. Where were Gary Larson, Dick Guindon, Bill Waterston, Cathy Guisewhite, Garry Trudeau, Berkeley Breathed (who could have been the next George Booth)? Not in the New Yorker.   The book does provide a fair sample of all 80 years, although I think some artists, especially William Hamilton, Gahan Wilson, and Bruce Petty, are not represented by their best work.  I was as frustrated as everyone else by the fuzzy pictures on the CD. This was particularly disappointing in the case of my favorite New Yorker caroonist, George Price. Besides being hilarious on a regular basis, he was brilliant in his meticulous renderings of everyday objects. (For an example, see his drawing of the back of a TV set on p. 269 of the book.) Unfortunately, on the CD, most of those details show up as blurry.  Hopefully, the New Yorker will do a better job next time around -- on their 100th anniversary 
 This book is a bit ponderous, to say the least - that's because I was interested in his clients' experiences and not the pedantic research crap (like the fact that they had to flush the IVs with saline). Lots of stuff in here begs the question, "Who Cares???" A better editor would have done this book wonders. Regarding the research, I find it highly disconcerting that EVERY ONE of his guinea pigs were huge into drugs. There was not a single person who was not a regular user of some kind of drug, and what's more, had done acid or 'shrooms hundreds of times. What would have been far more compelling is if he had done the test on people with a high level of spirituality but didn't require chemically altered states to achieve it. The book was poorly written and the research was questionable.  
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 While an interesting light read, these 'laws' are not immutable. Nor would your business be in peril if you ignored them, as the authors suggest.  In general, these laws are only for those obsessed with being number one. People going for those few #1 slots would find this book useless. For everyone else, there are a few small pearls to be gathered, but digging through the muck to find them makes them difficult to spot 
 Kaplan's thesis arise from her definition of "perversion." But given her wide definition of perversion, what use can we make of it, for almost anything will be, and can be, encompassed within this definition?   A work most distant from reality. A work of sophistry 
 I worked through "Beginning C++ Game Programming" by Michael Dawson and that book was fantastic.   However, this book is very vague, and not very helful at all. Unless you already know DirectX very well, don't bother with this book. It's extremely confusing and doesn't explain anything, it just gives pieces of code that don't always work. It's a complete waste if you're anything below an intermediate to advanced level. I'm very angry because this book cost me $50 at the bookstore and I probably won't use it. DONT BUY THIS BOOK 
 Well, I'm an (unemployed)agronomist here in Brazil.I'll be sincere.I didn't read this book and I don't want to do this.In fact I read the reviewrs, and I realize how ridiculous believes this book claims to be true. As an agronomist, I must tell everyone in the world the fact that biodiesel won't never be a significant energy's source.And this happens, not (only) because biodiesel takes far more energy than it has in itself.This happens because, there's no fat in the world to produce enough biodiesel even to the american use. Every year american burns about 5 billions of oil's brents.About more than 2 acres of soilbean will produce 4 brents of biodiesel in an year.Even if 100% of agricultural land IN THE WORLD to be used to produce this biodiesel, there wasn't enough oil to the USA's consumption of oil. I'm not a moron about biodiesel. To replace oil from another source of energy, won't be easy, cheap or fast.It will take decades, not months. Has agriculture a hope for oil's economy? Yes, it has.But any hopes can come from biodiesel. The agricultural real hopes ares: 1-Ethanol + hydrogen + eletricity(for gaseification or hydrogenation). 2-Eletric gaseification + Fischer-Tropsch process. 3-Thermo-hydrogenation catalitical. Any of these ways, using LESS than Brazil's agricultural land available can replace 100% of oil, used in the world today. Shuck the Sheyks, but not with biodiesel's fakes.Biodiesel is a way to transform some wastes into an usable fuel, not the solution to oil's dependence of America or any other place.    
 I have a couple of friends who don't have a computer.  Some CDs they like are not at the stores so I order them from you for them and they pay me back.  I bought the Rachmaninoff for myself, one that is very hard to find.  I received that, the two McCartney CDs & the Neil Young DVD, O.K. Thanks.. 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 Just not my cup of tea.  Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series 
 I rented the film version of "A Home at the End of the World" shortly after catching the "The Hours" on cable. I was pretty impressed with both. My guess was that "The Hours" had the kind of budget and richness to capture the book, whereas "A Home..." was a small independent film that had more handicaps. I figured the book on which it was based would be a better introduction to Cunningham, because it had a better shot at being stronger than the film. Well, sometimes the film is better....  The film really centers on Bobby and Jonathan. The book includes all of the main characters as narrators and has an overlapping narrative structure. Because of this, the book fleshes out the female characters better and we see why Jonathan's mother was cast with Cissy Spacek rather than someone who seemed Midwestern and why Jonathan's father was so remote. Bobby's character has more sides, although the result is that he is less vivid than Colin Ferrell's portrayal. The three-dimensionality in the book is probably more realistic, but the film version of Bobby captures better that which is important--his odd mix of emotional distance, engagement, adaptability and ambiability. Beyond his sexual orientation, Jonathan doesn't emerge very strongly in either medium.  The book oddly does worse in setting the time and place than the film. I grew-up in the Cleveland of the 60s and 70s and made many trips to New York in the 80s. Neither place fares well in the book. Cleveland was in approaching its nadir--an unhip place beginning a long economic decline, yet also a place with vibrant music scene (that attracted many future "names" for their early tours), racial tension, and the residue of various European ethnic cultures and rivalries---in other words, it had atmosphere and it was a good launching pad to go someplace more "hip". The book protrays a generic place that is more like the inland, second or third string cities of the Midwest--places like Columbus or Fort Wayne that are big on Babbitry and bragging about their chain restaurants. New York also seems oddly unlike itself. The New York of the book's era was filled with menace--crime, fear of crime, grafitti-filled subways, filth, and a general sense of dysfunction, as well as the kind of energy, vitality, and avant garde spirit that have always drawn people to the City. The book could have taken place in the tiny bohemian quarter of Atlanta or some other provincial backwater, for all it matters. The gay world of the book's time also is lacking--it takes place at beginning of the age of AIDS and the end of libertine gay liberation. Yet, talk of AIDS is muted beyond the early denial of its presence and Jonathan has to be most sexless gay man in queer lit. Popular music plays a big role in the book, but Cunningham seems to have drawn a random selection from hits lists of the 70s, rather than combinations of music that fit in time or that would have appealed to a common audience. Although Cunningham grew-up in this era, he clearly participated rather little in the popular culture of it.  The story proceeds like the movie, with the addition of Erich, Jonathan's  bartender "boyfriend" (the relationship is undefined and mysterious to both of them). Toward the end of the book, Erich seems to be more of a plot device than a real person. The other characters take care of him as he convalesces, but with an odd lack of commitment.   Few films or books are made about menage a trois relationships and fewer films ask us to buy Collin Ferrell as a twentysomething virgin. Yet, the book came off as something far less than the film. The odd semi-sexual bond between Bobby and Jonathan was believable in the film but not in the book. Cissy Spacek took a truncated script and a thankless role in the film and communicated more about the mother's story than what we get in the book, despite the greater backstory. The film does better without Erich and without the coyness about Jonathan's HIV status. I wish I could have given the book as many stars as most of the other reviews, but by the time I finished, I just was glad that the story had ended 
 I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed.  I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative).  A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents.  I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days.  The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author.  There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative.  For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile.  This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more 
 That is the call to action by Congressman J.D. Hayworth, representing the 5th Congressional District of Arizona.  In his book, Whatever it Takes, Congressman Hayworth sets to the task of explaining why it is so crucially important to finally get control of the Southern border with respect to the flow of illegal immigrants.  Not only is the porousness of the border dangerous to the national security of the United States, but it is dangerous to the security of American workers.  Focusing on the social problems which accompany unregulated, illegal immigration, the burdens placed on the education and medical systems, the criminal behavior of immigrants during their illegal entry and the threats caused by a fractious multiculturalism, Hayworth lays out his solution to the problem: immigration reform centered on strong enforcement policies.  Not only would the author like to see a security wall built from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, but it must be monitored by a significant increase in Border Patrol agents using modern high-tech surveillance devices to stem the flow of human traffic.  Moreover, he stresses that interior enforcement of businesses that hire illegal immigrants is the key to any successful immigration reform policy.  It is not enough to try and stop the flow of illegal immigrants at the border alone.  Through the penalization of businesses that hire illegal immigrants, the magnetic force which pulls illegal immigrants to cross the border in the first place would be reduced.  Not only is it necessary to enforce the current immigration laws that the United States already has, but the author elucidates new laws which should be enacted allowing the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service the ability to communicate freely with the Department of Homeland Security to stem the illegal use of forged documents by illegal immigrants to obtain jobs and collect payroll checks.    Congressman Hayworth is unapologetic in his diatribe as he deems the atmosphere of political correctness and race baiting surrounding the illegal immigration debate as disingenuous.  The overly sensitive manner in which illegal immigration is discussed is dangerous to our security, insomuch as it disallows serious discussion of the issues.  In his dismissive attitude of political correctness, he affords himself the opportunity to also address even more controversial subjects such as ending birthright citizenship laws for children born to illegal immigrants, ending "sanctuary" laws that forbid local and state police from providing information to federal immigration officers, limiting the issue of Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers so that illegal immigrants cannot obtain home loans or other financial services, establishing English as the national language of the United States, ending all bilingual education and denying social services and in-state tuition to illegal immigrants and their children.  Clearly the immigration debate is something which Congressman Hayworth is distinctly familiar with.  The 5th District of Arizona, while not directly on Mexico's border, is in the southern half of the state and experiences the migratory effects of illegal immigration directly.  First elected in 1994, Congressman Hayworth is solidly a Republican, with a voting record showing his conservative credentials.  However, his arguments opposing illegal immigration are nothing new and his book is, at often times, an inflammatory diatribe against the "liberal elite" and the "left-wing groups" who support "amnesty" for illegal immigrants.  With the distinct polarization of supporters and opponents of various immigration reform policies, Hayworth's book fits in nicely with Pat Buchanan's "State of Emergency" and Tom Tancredo's "In Mortal Danger," all three of which share the hard-line, strict enforcement approach towards solving the illegal immigration issue.  Congressman Hayworth falls victim, in a significant way, to just what he disparages in his book; the absolutism of his ideology and brusque manner of communicating his ideas leads to a diminution of articulate debate.  As such, the book is more of a duplicitous reactionary rant than it is a well thought-out and researched appeal to tighten the U.S.-Mexico border.  Through his use of oversimplified sloganeering, most of his arguments are based on the fact that because an illegal immigrant has broken the law to enter the United States, it does not matter what the immigrant may do for work, or in what ways immigrants may contribute to American society; the fact that they broke the law is tantamount and needs to be punished.  As much as I can appreciate his passionate appeal to "do something," Hayworth's approach to the problem, and more importantly, his disdain for liberalism in general, leads me to believe that a serious discussion of the relevant issues involved in the immigration debate would be lost in the rhetoric of his ideology 
 I decided to rent this after reading a few good reviews and hearing some decent things about her. I truly believe I have a good sense of humor and find comedy in all aspects of life. I do not get offended when watching any comedian.  There are very few stand up comics that I do not find funny in some way.  However, I was dismayed to realize that I just did not find 95% of this dvd funny. The jokes are slow coming and it even has some serious moments when she touches on some dead friends and gay marriage. Sure, there was a joke at the end of each, but I prefer stand up comics to deliver jokes a littler quicker than 1 every 3 minutes. It's as if she decided to use the recording of the show to get a serious message across. The serious 'hesitate' speech at the end did not make me hesitate to turn off this poor example of comedy. A nearly 5 minute speech on how we should accept everyone.  The voices that she does to represent other characters are extremely annoying. Especially the colonic therapist who is helping her when she goes for internal irrigation. That whole routine sounds like she actually went there and only for the purpose of new material. You just *knew* that some lame joke about touching her other area was coming, and sure enough, she delivered it.   Getting fisted by a lesbian dwarf?  Sorry, but it just was not funny.  The whole scene about visiting an S&M party seems to have been developed just to sound cool. Her method of repeating punch lines is also annoying, it was not funny the first time, why repeat it 
 We brought this book along with two others to the island.  This book and very little insider information and did not provide details on how to access and find hidden beaches.  Bring the Ultimate Guidebook to Kauai instead and that book will be your constant travel buddy.  I am actually leaving this book behind!  Save your money 
 The book might be ok for a very young reader.  However, from the summary and from the other review, I thought the book would be helpful to a young person with a telescope (to help them find what's out there).  I just received the book today and am returning it because it will certainly not be useful in this way 
 I value the Amazon Product Reviews and have purchased many items based on customer feedback.  I purchased this phone from Home Depot for $69.95.  I am returning it today.  It is to large for comfort, the reception is bad, the letters too small for those of us who need reading glasses... I could go on 
 There appears to be a movement among black and liberal American Catholics to create a "black Catholic" history that rightfully belongs to multiracial Americans. Louisiana Creoles are the victims of this attempt to create "black" Catholics, but the most prominent victims are three brothers born to an Irish-American father and a mulatto mother in antebellum Georgia. James Augustine Healy was bishop of the diocese of Portland, Maine from 1875 until his death in 1900. Patrick Francis Healy served successively as professor, prefect of studies, vice-rector, and, from 1874 to 1882, as rector of Georgetown University. Alexander Sherwood Healy served as rector of Holy Cross Cathedral and, for a few months before his death in 1875, as pastor of St. James Parish in Boston. Ochs admits that the Healys did not identify with blacks but with their Irish heritage and were not considered "black" by others. Indeed, not only were the Healy brothers only one-quarter "black" and of caucasian phenotype, but it was their Irish father who reared them as Catholics and paid for the educations that allowed them to rise to such high positions in their Church. Nevertheless, hypodecent fanatics like Ochs claim that "blacks" deserve all the credit 
 Loved The Magus.  Kept waiting for this one to take off.  Save for the one chapter on his first love - about three-quarters of the way through - I found little worth hanging onto.  Great observations about L.A. and the  film biz.  Colorful  descriptions of English countryside and the Nile  Delta.  But, sorry, none of it worth the 600+ page plod 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 I am reading the book "The Westing Game" and I say that this book absolutely awful.  The book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and I never like this before. The characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as "Crow", "Turtle', and "Uncle Sam". The scenery is bad, and I could imagine better places. The ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. I would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again.  The book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. I think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. I don't now how, but Newbery Award. I would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how I really think of this book. My summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed.  
 This is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer, keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans.  The characters in this story were likable.  I enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view.  I liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times.  However, I found much of the story to be utterly predictable.  From the moment I started reading, I could tell exactly how Tibby's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the "cool" kids would turn out.  I also knew what would happen when Bee tracked down her grandmother.  Carmen's mother's relationship followed an equally predictable arc.  Although the characters were good, I found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest 
 I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better. BOOK WAS OKA 
 At least the one I recieved for Christmas just simply does not work!  OK so now I have to figure out how to return it...  this was a gift that came from out of my household, but none the less I was given the receipt.  However if you call the 1-800 number all you get is a recording that says if you leave a name and number they will get back to you by tomorrow or... go to their website and see instructions for return.  This was ordered from Amazon so I don't have "Their" web address!!!! Hmmm  FYI 
 Like Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum, these authors seems to lose steam after a while.  I suppose it's hard to keep pulling a rabbit out of your hat all the time, but Patrick Robinson is definitely on the downward slide of his talent slope.    Since HMS Unseen, which was great, Robinson has gone to heavy-handed attempts to forcefeed us right wing propaganda and his stories suffer for it.  The Democrats are portrayed as weak, stupid, and the source of all the world's problems and with no redeeming qualities.  If he spent less time on politics and more time on character development, this could have been a better product. Instead the effort comes off forced and clumsy.  If you worship the holy trinity of Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Rush Limbaugh, this is the book for you.  If you like thrillers with a little more subtlety and believability, spend your money on Nelson DeMille or Brian Haig.  
 I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance 
 I love the concept of ironing this way, I just needed a machine that didn't leak out all of the water for steam all over the table 
 Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre.  When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened.  When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions.  When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming.    In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed.   Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying.  My question to Mr. Patterson is:  If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first ï¿½ of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end?  Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)?  I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters.  Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel.   My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense.  For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows.  Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing.  This is ridiculous.  Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find.  How else do people buy drugs from them?  It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames.    Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal.  It doesn't make sense.  Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality.  Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid. 
 Trinity Collection is a Bootleg. Picture is extremly poor. 3 movies for $10. Too bad, I like Trinity, she's cute. Ooops, wrong Trinity.. 
 When one watches a George Bernard Shaw play, one does not expect three-dimensional characters with social roles and inner lives.  As the author puts it in a pompous forward to this film, 'Major Barbara' is a 'PARABLE' (his capitals), and the preaching never lets up.  The title character (Wendy Hiller) is the daughter of a millionaire arms manufacturer (Robert Morley); she is a zealous Salvation Army officer, trying to convert the destitute of London with enthusiasm, sympathy and 'a bribe of bread'.  She is seen one afternoon in mid-proselysation by Adolphus Cusins (Rex Harrison), an impoverished Classics scholar who determines to marry her.  The stage is set for a typical Shavian problem play - you might subtitle the piece 'The Soul of Man Under Capitalism', with the religious fanatic and the urbane industrialist doing battle for the souls of the English working and middle classes.  Barbara is tested by drama; Undershaft fights back with mind-numbing spectacle - capitalism's genius is that it absorbs all opposition.  The loser is the audience.  'Barbara' is one of Shaw's less intolerable plays, with the odd funny line (all snatched by Marie Lohr as Barbara's aristocratic mother) peeping through the flat epigrams, laborious dailogues and general sterile clever-cleverness.  The wonderful cast - Hiller saintly and sexy in military uniform; Harrison hysterically smart-*r*ed; Morley unflappably Machiavellian and Mephistophelean - do what they can, but they are playing Ideas, not Characters, and their attempts to blow life into cardboard only results in soggy paper.  It's never nice being aggressively lectured to, and Shaw's grinding dialectic becomes less agreeable on the big screen - his use of old dramatic forms for non-dramatic purposes stops everything dead (although you can see how filming an ironic play about the armanents industry might have seemed radical during World War 2).  The works isn't improved by Pascal's hapless filming (what can he do?), his style as clunky and grey as Shaw's sub-Wildean wit.  There are some major talents behind the scenes, including David Lean as editor and William Walton as composer 
 These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again 
 Elaine Feinstein obviously didn't have access to many sources for this VERY poor biography.  Sylvia Plath certainly cast a huge shadow over Hughes' life, but we get very little insight into the Hughes-Plath marriage from Hughes' perspective.  Feinstein doesn't know how to write biography--a difficult art form for anyone who isn't willing to hurt feelings or take criticism.  Feinstein didn't want to annoy ANYONE with her lame book.  Dates are given incorrectly and names are misspelled to the point at which I wonder exactly how much attention the author was giving to her sloppy manuscript, and how quickly she felt she needed to get it published before somebody else decided to cover the subject of Hughes in a thorough, responsible fashion.  Don't waste your money on this book.  Check it out of the library if you must, but don't buy it 
 This is perhaps the most liberal textbook I have ever read in my entire life. The authors come across as subjective and emotional, espousing the evils of capitalism and taking responsibility for one's own actions. 
 There really should be a disclaimer on the back of this book; the description given doesn't prepare the reader for the incessant preaching.  What could have been a decent mystery is totally ruined by the insertion of religion in nearly every sentence. If Ms. Blackstock wants her books to reach a wider audience then she needs to tone it down a lot.  If she's satisfied with "preaching to the choir" then she's done the job well because these books will never be successful out in the real world 
 The author covers a variety of subjects but too lightly to be useful. Too much effort is spent on things that are useless.  For example, Testing of Loudspeakers - part of the book's title - is barely 13 pages and is so basic as to not allow tuning of cabinet design. Rather this section focuses on determining specifications that speakers already come with. Suggestion of using PVC piping for ducts and asphalt paper for damping really remove any credibility for a successful high fidelity outcome using these techniques. Pictures of a hammer over a brad and a ruler on a woofer kind of tells it all. Many pages taken up with basic programming print outs - stuff that's available in Windows format free on the internet now.  Horn designs are not covered and the project section only has a couple of basic designs. That said, the author does a great job telling you how to make inductors for cross-over networks.I was done with this 200 page book in about 1 hour. Rather dissapointing 
 I read Vance Matthews review of this book and was sceptical.  The editorial reviews of this book gave me the impression it would be a concise collection of EPA, USGS, and ASTM standards related to hydrogeological investigations.  I was greatly disappointed.  At this point I am still unclear who the target  audience would be for this book 
 After 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please. 
 Mr. Greenblatt's theories continue an academic tradition of discounting the individual work of the writer by forcing historical context over text, treating the writer of a creative work as mere vessel.  What happened to the individual reader encoutering the writer via the work of art?  Of course, this common sense approach would cut short a lot of pedantic careers, and that is what Critical Theory is all about: it allows pedants to have a job 
 I was not impressed with the quality of this book.  The instructions are informative and easy to follow but the headpiece designes are out of date.  The pictures are hand drawn and do not capture the instructions they are depicting.  I have learned about the steps and general techniques of veil making after reading this book. However, I think  color photos and updated designes would be helpful 
 I had never read anything by Roth and when I finally got around to him I made the mistake of picking The Plot Against America. I enjoy "what if" books and found the idea compelling... unfortunately the book is not. It doesn't dare enough in imagining an alternative (and frightening) scenario, it fails at creating suspence and pathos at almost every turn, and it's a slow and disjointed yawn of a book. Characters are mostly very flat and the there are pages and pages of truly useless page fillers... I can't imagine why i would ever want to pick up another book of his.   You need to be a genius to act so poorly on such a good idea for a story. 
 The first books by John Ringo were gripping tales of interstellar war and invasion, liberally laced with what he himself calls carnography. By the time his third book was published though, he seems to have learned the all too common skill of filling pages without providing any content.  "The Hero" tries to tell the story of a military special operations team a thousand years in the future. All the characters are totally forgettable, and indeed the authors proceeds to kill most of them off quickly enough. The story consists of the teams travails slogging around a hostile countryside playing Blind Man's Bluff, while some of the members try to kill each other. The situations are arbitrary and meaningless. The authors introduce strange fauna, and then mostly ignore them except when convenient. The equipment carried by the soldiers is shockingly primitive for a culture with a millennium of uninterrupted technical civilization.  The only minor points of interest are that Ringo finally includes the English pronunciation of his Bane Sidhe (for those who hadn't figured it out), we learn a little (very little) about the Aldenata, and there is confirmation that the Posleen were bioengineered, like that's a surprise 
 I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do 
 WOW!I got this book back in 2003 and I dont recommend this book for begginers its very complex to understand I would rather get  Beginning Tagalog: A Course for Speakers of English     by J. D. Bowen   
 I enjoyed the subject and was fascinated on how he tied information theory into such a wide variety of areas of science.   However, I found his writing style condescending. It might be good for someone without a scientific or technical background, but if you have already read a lot about information and complexity, you find his coverage a little "light". [I just have an BS in electrical engineering]   I found his lengthy analogies and mental experiments distracting and imprecise. They got in the way of truly understanding the science. But, others might find them fun. 
 This book is disgustingly slanted toward the position of the pro-Isreali's. Each page is becomes more blatent. It's impossible for any book to be completely void of bias, but Randall Price doesn't even make an effort to lay out the facts and let the reader draw their own conclusion. It's just riduculous. I usually buy my books instead of borrowing from the library in order to support the authors; but take my advice and save you money with this one.  That is, of course, unless your mind is already made up and you simply want to feel better about your obstinance. 
 So you say you want to read about Revolution? Well you know, this book ain't gonna change the world.  A title from Acapella's "Vinyl Frontier" series, Revolution is more along the lines of an extended album review than it is a "behind-the-scenes" blow-by-blow (a turn of phrase which wasn't much off, judging by how the Fab Four began to go off each other by the late 1960s). Mr. Quantick always seems to be two or three steps removed from the source material when he regales stories of the Beatles' disputes and conversations in and beyond the studio, giving the book as a whole a decidedly unfamiliar feel.  The majority of the book is devoted to a highly subjective editorial-charged rundown of the 30-some songs on the two-LP set known popularly as "The White Album," but in reality titled The Beatles. There are some deliciously snarky remarks offered with no apologies about tunes for which the author apparently didn't care (of George Harrison's masterpiece "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," the author describes a "big bloaty thing" which "inadvertantly invented '70s rock, which is arguably a bad thing but ensured the sale of small cigarette lighters for the next decade." Get it?), however they feel somewhat forced as if the author - with his tone of studied hipness - wanted to be Bigger Than The Beatles with his narrative presence in the title.  If a person wants to know absolutely everything there is to know about the famed British rock group, then this would be a nice starting place, as the material is neither fresh nor innovative. It is a brief read, best enjoyed with a copy of the album in question playing in the background. As a stand-alone piece, the book barely works at all.  Though for all its faults, the book looks almost as cool as the actual album cover of The Beatles when placed on an otherwise bare coffee table. 
 These reviews are probably more interesting than the book. What's so interesting about them is that the reviewers don't seem to get that more than two-thirds of the country are now fully aware of Bush's utter incompetence as a leader. The "vast left-wing conspiracy" now consists of a 2/3 majority of the country. Apparently, 1 1/2 years wasn't enough time for a clear majority of voters to figure it all out. But nearly 3 1/2 years later, we all see. This book is a couple of years too late. Today it's utterly ridiculous to denounce a "conspiracy" to reveal the TRUTH 
 The reason many of us fail to succeed is that we buy into common sense.  This book does just that by reinforcing bad practices.  It suggests that one should save and invest wisely.  There is little way in which a person could achieve significant wealth by this method though perhaps a good retirement.  The most successful people do not follow this method.  I am pretty well off myself and I can say I did not follow this method and had I, I would not be doing so well.  Unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth (not that I know of).  Compare the wealth of Richard Branson versus Donald Trump - two very different approaches without few similarities.  My mother followed this approach and ended with just a small savings.  The story sounds appealing until you realize that it is fiction - there was no such man and that should speak for itself.  
 Frankly, I'm still ticked at having wasted however many hours of my life it took to read YSKOV! (and does anybody else find the exclamation mark as pretentious as all get-out?)  The original hardcover was fascinating: I'd never seen a book in such a hurry to get started that the text began right on the cover.  This was a guy I could get to like.  Problem was, I bought the later paperback edition in an effort to save a few dollars.  If you're still curious, do yourself a favor and spring for the original hardcover--it's a good deal less bloated.  Were there brilliant pages/paragraphs?  Sure.  Too bad they were so interspersed with self-indulgent, pseudo-self-deprecating, unfunny filler as to nearly ruin the book.  I spent the first 100 pages or so enchanted and the last several hundred wishing he and his friend would just go home already 
 I enjoy reading The Years Best Fantasy & Horror but this is the first time I have ever been bored to death and pleased by my decision to borrow it from my public library. Generally the stories consist of great writing and really encourage you to seek out additional work by many of the authors featured. This collection consists of very weak and quite appallingly bad stories the worst being "Old Virginia". Many of the stories appeared in other anthology collections and it seems that the editors have chosen some of the worst works from them. "The Dark" had some great and generally creepy stories but instead of choosing any number of those they selected the story by Kelly Link which was god-awful, too long and quite confusing. I'm not sure if the departure of Ms. Windling has contributed to the general laziness of this volume but if so, please bring her back 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in "Stairway To Heaven". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!! 
 Produced entirely in black & white, and with very small images.  The original was in color & about twice the size.  There is really nothing to hold your interest, visually.  This will turn people off to Krazy Kat.  I sent my copy back 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 It is unfortunate this book didn't come out better. Some glaring problems with it include: - has no concept of energy physics to begin with - does not understand "hydrogen economy" (hydrogen's an expensive storage, not a source of energy) - downplays geological data of oil discovery (or doesn't understand it), although Hubbert is covered briefly - believes or disseminates half-baked unproven ideas from the research sector: scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels - does not deal with the net energy concept (EROEI) or even refer to it  With these fundamental oversights it's really difficult to recommend the book.  It's not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right, but mostly it's pathologically impartial journalistic fluff, without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should.   It's too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil, gas and coal with tar sands, nuclear power, hydrogen and live happily ever after.  To those readers who want to believe this, this might be a good book. People looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed.  I'd recommend books by Deffeyes, Simmons, Heinberg, Campbell and many others before this (all on peak oil) 
 What a piece of liberal trash!  My five year old found it useful to press flowers 
 Let's see. Ken Starr wastes the public money attacking Bill Clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with KON-servative Mitch Mcconnel of KY to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there aren't any already !!! This book is a perfect tool for neconservative NAZIS to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by Bush/Cheney/Rove/Delay and GOP with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend Clinton but easily caved into and defended Bush the liar-in-chief ! 
 It's interesting to hear Peter Brown tell his side of the story. I first read this book over 20 years ago, and recently read it again. While informative and interesting, I do find some of Peter Brown's "Dirty Little Secrets" about the Beatles to be unfair and distasteful. Brian has been dead since the 1960's and John Lennon has not been with us since 1980. Both Paul & Ringo deny some of the situations described in this book, and George denounced the book as "Utter Rubbish". And since a lot of the wild oulandish stories in this book are made about John (who obviously was not around at this book's first printing to comment), I'd say that both Brown & Gaines took advantage of John's absence and made one hell of a killing off of their "dirty little book". But what the hell, I read it...TWICE! So can you. Just don't believe EVERYTHING you read here. There were enough incidences of "Bad Behavior" admitted by the Beatles themselves in the "Anthology" series. So now, re-tooled for 2006, this "tell-all" book comes off a little lame. But it's still "back-stabbing good fun" is it not? Getting caught is much more sensational than a confession, isn't it? I quote from the same song (The ballad Of John & Yoko) In which John made Peter Brown's name immortal: "Christ, you know it ain't easy!" Thanks a lot Peter Brown, for crucifying our heroes. I always feel better when someone I love is slandered and smeared, don't you? God Forgive you Peter Brown.  
 This was given to me as a gift. I used it almost every day for about 1 1/2 months then a cable on it broke.It never even worked that well to begin with. I e-mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty. They told me they had to order it from China and had no idea when it would come. They gave no apologies, they could not have cared less. EIGHT months later after I had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me!!!!! I used it for 1 month the whole year!! How lame 
 Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. Bought Gourmet cook book instead 
 I personally found the *gritty* style of this book annoying.  I knew it was an intimate look at the circumstances surrounding the disasterous Hubbard expedition and the subsequent journey undertaken by his wife Mina, but this account reads more like a 1950s pulp novel or a Louis L'amour western.  The prose is choppy and entirely too chatty, sinking at times to a veritable nadir of banality: "George stepped off the Williamstown train, feeling like a fox ready to have his heart pulled." (whatever hell that means), or "...a lot of trappers weren't interested in the idea of foolin' with someone dead" (too folksy).  In short it's a slipshod narrative history written in the vein of an adolescent adventure story 
 Finkelstein's book is endorsed by Noam Chomsky, the arch propagandist, for anti Israel, anti western causes. Is it a valuable book? Is anything endorsed by the Chomskys and Edward Saids of this world of any value 
 who feels this way about this CD.  When I first bought it I bought it because I liked the song "If You See Him" which I had heard on the radio and I thought that maybe Reba had come back to recording country music.  Boy was I wrong!!  The rest of the CD gave me a headache with such pop tunes as "One Honest Heart" and "Invisible".  I think this is my least favorite of all of Reba's albums which I continue to buy whenever a new one is released in the hopes that Reba has gotten rich enough now to where she can go back to the real country music that made her a name and not this pop stuff which I can't stand anymore.  
 PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS CAMERA'S SHOCK SENSITIVITY  I was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the SECOND time. It's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world. The result is it loses it's ability to focus and zoom. It didn't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket, with the lens protruding, thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly.  The first time it happened Casio repaired it under warranty. The second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that's more than 1/3 the original purchase price. I won't reinvest in a weak product. I'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether 
 I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned.  Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market.  The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it.  Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on.  On other occasions it completely locks up.  The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message "PROTECT UNPLUG".   The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner.  I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system.    First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load.  To insert a disk one has to press an "Eject" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk.  If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over.  Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be.  On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful.  I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception.  Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review.    Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great.  It's average.  Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass.  The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it.  But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now.  I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon.    
 I had high hopes for this cd. I love norwegian metal, and I love viking stuff so I thought this would be great. I was at least hoping it would be good. What I heard was a bunch of uninspired, mediocre, a dime a dozen metal songs. I mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste, but not enough to give it even 3 stars. The high points are The fate of Norns, The persuit of Vikings, and Arson. These songs are bad @$$ and fun to listen too. An Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm 5.5 just mediocre Where Death Seems To Dwell 5.5 very repetitive The Fate Of Norns 7 This one is pretty good. It has a repetitive punchy opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to it. The Pursuit Of Vikings 7.5 This is my favorite song from this cd. Pretty Bad A$$. Valkyries Ride 5.5 Tedious Monotony The Beheading Of A King 5.5 Same as Valkryies Arson 7.5 A bit of a slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic guitar Once Sealed In Blood 5.5 a bit faster than some but still a downer. All in all nothing horrible, and there is some good songs. The music is a little on the simple side which doesnt necasarily make it bad. I like a lot of simpler music like Darkthrone and Burzum. The problem is that when it comes to simpler stuff I like it to have some really good aptmosphere. That is precisly what is lacking here. I will still listen to it occasionally hoping that it will grow. 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 The only reason this gets 2 stars is because its a little better than the first version but not by much. Maps are terrible, char guides are bad, inconsistent and wrong, online information is easier to find and use. Mob info is sparse and usless, drop info is just a print out. Sorry I want this to be a good book but its not. If you are totally new to the game you may feel that this is a good companion to your gaming however if you have any char > lvl 40 its kinna useless 
 This book is awful.  The writing is bad, the plot is thin, the characters are underdeveloped.  Synners had potential, but ruined it with pages and pages of dream-type sequences and unexplained ramblings.  There were so many characters that it was ridiculous to keep track of them all.  Important events were skipped over and not explained at all, substituted with phrases resembling "a few days later...everything was fine."  I do not recommend this book 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 Corny. It's an old word but an apt description of this book. It starts well enough, but melts into bathos as the protagonist goes from the cruel city to the countryside, where he meets one soap-opera saint after another. There's the old lady who needs an operation she can't afford, the sensitive adolescent who's afraid to leave home for college, the wise Indian matron, the hulking retarded kid who just needs a little attention, and his dad, the tough but fair sherriff.  And the hero, another of those armed robbers with a heart of gold you meet so often, manages to save every one of them.  It's like starting out in a caper movie and ending up on the Andy Griffith Show. Jeez, when did America go all corny? How did the country that produced Scorsese and Hunter S. Thompson turn chicken so fast 
 Some 34 years after the publication of the Clement letter and the gospel fragments it preserves and 16 years after Smith's death, his work continues to be attacked.  Although The Secret Gospel of Mark Unveiled pretends to eschew "armchair psychoanalysis dressed up as objective scholarship," the book fairly oozes it. Smith's recollection of his discovery is described with terms like "extreme mood swings and bouts of amnesia" and "dissociative episodes." In fact, the book is largely a bashing of Smith, not a discussion of the text he discovered.   Smith, like most homosexuals of his generation, was conflicted. So what? The evidence that must be addressed is not Smith's sexual orientation, but the text of the New Testament. A particular flaw of Jeffrey's argument is that Jesus, a rural Palestinian Jew, must have known of the classical Greek "model" of pederasty. From this unsupportable assumption flows an entire line of specious reasoning.  Those interested in the "Secret Gospel" will find little to detain them here. The author knows of, but largely ignores, the work of Meyer and Brown on this subject, and passes over the work of Crossan, Koester and Dart. Writers who have expressed negative opinions of Smith and his work are briefly cited, but their conclusions never examined in any depth. This book is as riddled with special pleading and omission as Swiss cheese is with holes. Let the buyer beware.  Robert Conner, Austin, Texa 
 Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe.  This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins.  When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints.  She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size.  We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug.  The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily 
 This was a total waste of money.  The "Aloha" set was great, but this one was a major disappointment.  One entire DVD was nothing but re-takes and out-takes, the same thing over and over.  It could have all been scaled down on one DVD and been much more interesting.  We are big Elvis fans, just went to Graceland on our anniversary.  Elvis was a great entertainer and this is an insult to his fans for paying so much money to be bored!  Elvis was never boring!!!  This was marketed to get you to buy it, DON'T!  Save your money 
 I was certainly looking forward to reading this book.  While I haven't read any of the other books written by this author; his reputation preceeds him.  Unfortunately, I was wholly unimpressed by his approach.  I find the writing style very unnatural for mathematics.  It can be difficult to follow the long, rambling sentences with his strange turns of phrase.  While I can appreciate that this is modern writing, the style is inappropriate for the subject.  Mathematics must be presented clearly and accurately.  I left the book thinking that the author didn't understand the subject very well himself.  It's an interesting topic and therefore there is something to be gained here.  Sadly, there are much better alternatives to this one.  If you have a mathematical background the book may irritate you with it's style.  A pity though, it is a wonderfully rich and interesting subject 
 This book is totally dissapointing. The authors have no knowledge of aviation business. All the book is just ass-leaking of SWA. They should have done more research just to understand how airline business work.  The book repeats and repeats the same. It is just honoring of SWA. SWA has no flaws, SWA is the best etc. And there is no explanation why it is best. It is just abstract explnations from textbooks on Leadearship etc. There is no logyc connection between the statements they make and the results they come to in this book.  If you have too much money and time to waste, and you are a masohistic type of person who likes to be dissapointed by some stupid mediocre unprofessional writing by people who do not know anything the thing they write about - this book for you. Otherwise - just forget about the book called "Nuts!" by Freibergs and look for another good source of information about SWA 
 I was raised Christian, but very recently have been actively pracicing Buddhism. Although I have rejected many of the belifs from Christian church, I am still trying to reconcile my Christian upbringing with Buddhism. I read Living Buddha, Living Christ a while ago and although the message was simplistic, I enjoyed the book. I was expecting further discussion of Christianity and Buddhism in Going Home, but was dissapointed that it was a disjointed series of dharma talks with the difficult to understand, circular language that many Buddhism books contain and little real content on Christianity and Buddhism 
 You may love your kids, the smell of a newborn baby, and finger paintings, but Bill Keane's trecherously unfunny and maudlin anthology is unbearable. While it is clear Family Circus contains neither razor-like wit nor social commentary, the offensively poor quality of Keane's humour will be come inevitably clear as you turn the second page. After 40+ years of writing this comic strip, surely Keane's capacity for humour is no longer what it once was. However, astonishingly, upon viewing Keane's first Family Circus comic in the 1960s, it became clear that there never was any humour in it. No 
 I am a fan of the great Dan Jenkins and his exemplary sports writing over the years. But I have to give this book a thumbs down. The story is not much more than a Nora Roberts-type potboiler, with a lot of historical and cultural references thrown in. Did I say "a lot"? Jenkins, a life-long Texan, packs in an unbelievable amount of name-dropping, and allusions to long-ago people, places, and things, that at times it's hard to find the plot among all those references. A little nostalgia for days gone by can be a good thing, but I'm afraid it was way overdone here 
 I was disappointed when I received this CD.  Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two. By your side, (my favorite) is good for about two minutes.  Then the beat gets off track, and starts to sound terrible.  If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom why. I know this is "lo-fi", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all.  As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own. I think this CD would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop.  If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look elsewhere 
 The Next Attack is one of the latest - and worst - examples of popcorn political diatribes that lack substance, intellectual heft and reasoned analysis.  Unlike Through our Enemies' Eyes and Imperial Hubris, the Next Attack makes unsubstantiated histrionic pronouncements and offers the authors' opinions dressed up as meaningful observations.  Moreover, they offer little to give meaning to the subtitle of the book - there is virtually nothing of substance relating to "a strategy for getting it right."  If you're only going to read one book about what's right and wrong (and there is a great deal wrong with it) this, unfortunately, isn't it 
 Unlike most of the reviewers I found this book on the boring side. I think it could have been half the length, too. A lot of it was unnecessary and should have been edited better. I enjoyed The House Of Scorpion, but not this one. This book was average, nothing special and written with a lot of passive voice.  It wasn't unique. It read like many other similar books. 
 This set of CD's never arrived. They must have been delivered to the wrong address. So I am disappointed to never have heard them 
 "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together.  If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated.  However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you.  By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop.  One never materialized.  This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.   As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion.  Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages.  
 Straight up: Dip Set is garbage. This album is no exception, although in comparison to all the albums that they released, this is one of the better ones. Trufully, Cam'ron has very limited lyrical skills, and it displays throughout this album. Although during this time this album was released, he was just signed to Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records (you saw how long that lasted). Also around this time, some of the Dip Set artists (Jim Jones and Juelz Santana) were starting to surface. They themselves also weigh this album down. I did like the first single "Oh Boy". Also the second single "Hey Ma" was good also. The album's hugh highlight would be "Welcome To New York" featuring Jay-Z, that was well thought out.  The album also has many low points. A lot of these songs like "Loosing Weight 2" shows how very limited Cam'ron's skills are behind the mic. Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel do absolutely nothing for the song "The Roc". Production is good, like the Daz produced "Leave Me Alone", but Cam couldn't pull it together. Just Blaze and Kanye West would also toss in a few beats on this album also.  "Come Home With Me" is average at best. It has a few good songs and a lot of skip material. If you're used to hearing Cam on albums, then you might want to check this out for a few good tracks, or download it to hear how it sounds like. This isn't one I could fully get into.   Lyrics: C Production: B+ Guest Appearances: C- Musical Vibes: C Overall: C  Favorite Tracks: Oh Boy, Welcome To New York City, Hey Ma,   Peace Everyone 
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 This would be a great book except it needs to be updated for Matlab R12 and (now) R13.  Many of the functions referenced in the book (e.g. zplot, freqz) have now in the signal processing toolkit so one really needs to acquire this toolkit to make the book fully useful 
 Look, this game is sooo much funner without this guide...this guide only gives away things. Its not hard either so theres no reason to buy a guide for i 
 This is a very famous book, and so I looked forward to reading it with a lot of hope that it would help my game.  I found it to be pretty close to useless, and would certainly never recommend it to anyone.  It does, however, do a good job of exalting Harvey Penick, which may have been his purpose in publishing it 
 I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning.  French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying.  Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more. 
 I have this book and I think it's cheaply made.School doesn't realy work that way as shown in the book.Overall,if there is somrthing this book can teach us is how not to act and dress in school.Honestly,we should take school more seriosly. 
 The production quality is almost as bad as the depressingly awful music.  Don't be fooled folks.  The "artistic" hacks may love it, but beauty is TRUELY in the eye of the beholder. If you enjoyed the awesome first 3 soundtracks; don't waste your money on this one expecting more of the same.    Instead you will receive a CD chocked full of unimaginative (i.e. high-schoolers without talent playing on their home computers) techno and "spoken word" type lyrics that are laughably bad (but only if you didn't shell out $13.99 to listen to them).  I'm now the proud owner of a $14.00 coaster, b/c that's about all it's good for 
 This movie really showcases the extreme dorkiness of the early 80s. But it's really no one's fault, they didn't KNOW they were dorks back then, that's just the way everyone acted before Michael Jackson came along.  Clarence Beeks (the Breakfast Club guy) turns in his usual McGruff the Crime Dog performance. And nice appearance by Tom Hanks too; his 2nd best performance, very closely behind Saving Private Ryan, which I would recommend watching immediately after seeing this movie. They go well together.  Oh well, at least this movie gave the Police Squad! an idea on how to open up their show. And it's still better than Hercules in New York, although by very much, no 
 This worked great for about two weeks of minimal use. I live in New York and I don't believe I got more than 5 gallons of water before the filter stopped working completely. Definately not worth the money 
 I was disappointed that the "Open Your Eyes (Baloobalot Hot House Piano Dub)" by Rhythm Scholar was not on this CD.  It's really the only Donovan worth listening to.  Skip this and get something by Ochwat & Sam or Spanky My Monkey instead 
 I like looking at old pictures and old letters, but I thought when I bought the book that I would actually be looking in the history of someone's life with pictures to go with it but that was not the case.  It is just a random bunch of pictures and a random bunch of letters put together in a book.  The pictures aren't necessarily the pictures of the people who wrote the letters, so you know nothing of the authors, no explanation of the times they lived in or the place they lived in or anything.  In other words, no story behind it whatsoever.  Just a disappointing collection 
 Ballard makes several keen insights in this book (many of them startlingly prescient).  However, digging those nuggets of clarity out of the surrounding mess is difficult and often unrewarding work.  The repetetive and disjointed nature of the narrative quickly leads to confusion--confusion about the characters, their motives, and the surrounding events.  And perhaps that was intentional, but it doesn't make for a satisfying read.  "The Assasination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race" was one of the few bright spots in the narrative, but not quite bright enough for me to consider this book as anything more than a failed experiment 
  Buffy didn't move to Sunnydale until half way through the school year.   Therefore, she was still living in Los Angeles at the time this book supposedly took place.  Glaring continuity problems seem to plague all the Buffy books.  The fact that the authors aren't given permission to advance the storyline of the show in any meaningful way make the books the equivalent of really boring filler episodes of the show.  Only the books aren't as well-written and Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't around to salvage the tripe.  Reading the authors attempts at dialogue is funny (laughing at them funny) at first, but then it just gets painful.  The book reads like overly earnest fan fiction and all the characters become insufferable because of their sappiness and led balloon one-liners.   I don't know Nancy Holder and Christopher Golden personally, but reading this filled me with a strong dislike and sense of pity for both of them.    
 The editor provides a wide selection of essays on the subject of the potential growth of American labor in the United States without substantiating any real insurgency.  While hindsight is always 20-20, we now see that labor has declined since the publication of this book, perhaps the book's optimism and lack of critical analysis is its major weakness.  The labor movement cannot rely on empty phrases.  The writers are drawn from well known new left academics and labor leaders that optimistically predict a rosy future for a new revitalization of the American labor movement.  Unfortunately, the editor takes for granted the writers' assertions that are unsubstantiated without a critical analysis.  Labor has clearly changed from the cold war era.  However, no nuance is detected here, given that exhortation does not bring about revival nor does it make it true that organized labor has emerged from its past bureaucratic and territorial character.  The book is interesting, but larded with hubris and hopeful expectations.  More helpful would be a prospective assessment of labor's problems.  If readers are interested in what labor intellecuals were thinking in the aftermath of Sweeney's rise to power, this book provides interesting commentary.  To understand how a new labor movement is constructed, the editor and authors must understand how capital remakes labor. 
 Although this book is a detailed, if overintellectualised, account of the Sex Pistols' short career and the ludicrous media games of Malcolm McLaren and Glitterbest, It is not by any stretch of the imagination, a book on U.K. Punk. It completely bypasses England's second generation of Punk (1981-1983)out of which sprang many of the Greatest Punk Bands Of All, such as The Exploited, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chaotic Dischord ,Disorder, The Anti-Nowhere League, Chaos U.K., G.B.H., and The Insane! None of these bands are even briefly mentioned in this book! It's As If Jon Savage,poncey journalist that he is, is afraid to acknowledge their existence! Instead he wastes page after agonizing page reading overblown hippie-like ideas into the useless New Wave bands he erroneously believes to be punk! The one or two lines about Crass don't even begin to make up for this pompous smokescreen. Worthless, Stalinist tripe!!!! Save your money and save yourself a headache! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! 
 This book is not worthy of the "Unleashed" series, which typically has stellar books.  Mostly just marketing level advice with very little in-depth information.  You can get more information out of a Google search 
 the book is easy to read and is clear. but because of my first time of this nature of material it is the first information so i have no idea to compare too. It is written for easy learning. Lind 
 Intelligence in Warfare is a simplistic, arguably inaccurate, and often times pompous attempt by noted British historian John Keegan's personal theory that intelligence operations play little part in warfare as a whole.   Some have argued that this book is about how intelligence in but one piece of leadership, but Keegan's arguments refute this rather than support it. To Keegan, intelligence is sometimes crucial, sometimes not, and most of the time just a minor part of a whole. If that is the case, then why write this book? At numerous times in each case study, Keegan observes that the outcome would have been different had the intelligence gathered been acted upon, rather than cast aside. A chapter later he will complain that the intelligence should have been cast aside, and that basing decisions on faulty inteligence caused the defeat. He essentially contradicts himself chapter by chapter.   You can't have it both ways. Though his writing is fluid and poetic as always (Keegan makes the age of sail come alive better than anyone) this book is a prime case of "staying in your lane" of expertise. Intelligence is merely one part of the battle, and rarely tilts the decision one way or another. The challenge of intelligence is recognizing the value of specific bits of information in a sea of speculation. In this case, there are many other books out there on the topic that are worth the expense. 
 An Autobiography of Jack Gantos told under the name of Joey Pigza. While Jack Gantos sits in his jail cell he tells you the story of how he got there. Young Jack wants to be a writer, but growing up in a poor family means that he doesn't have the money to go to school. So he goes to live with his grandparents in the Virgin Islands. Shortly discovering how much Jack drinks, they kick him out. 	From there, he goes to live with a family who have an extra room and he messes that up too when he gets sick all over their house. After going through that and a ghetto hotel, he goes home to St Croix to live with his parents and work with his dad. He makes minimum wage by making and shipping crates. When a gut named Hamilton comes in with blueprints for a special crate for smuggling hash he offers jack a job. Jack sees the opportunity to get rich quick and use it to go to college, he had no second thoughts. He ends up in a medium security prison for smuggling drugs to the US. 	I really enjoyed this book because I, myself have done wrong things to do good things. I've also thought about doing things to get money quick. It's easy to make bad decisions when things are hard in life. this is an awsome book for teenagers to read and i think everybody should read this 
 This is nowhere near the "Best of" as there are too many classic UFO songs missing. This is merely a selection of a few greats and an overview of the Paul Chapman era when to be honest none of the songs featured would ever make a true best of selection. Check out "Essential" for a more realistic best of collection for the period. Better still buy the Live "Strangers in the Night" album, which is excellent value and has all you need to start to appreciate a great band. 
 I agree with the previous posters, this has to be one of the worst designed toys from Hot Wheels yet!  My son just received this for his 4th birthday and every button or feature on it has frustrated him (he's screaming at it as I'm writing this!).  He was so excited when he got it, as he lives for anything Hot Wheels.  He is determined to get everything to work on the truck but I can tell that he is going to get so frustrated with it that he'll end up breaking it.  Save yourself the money and your child the heartbreak, don't buy this toy 
 Certainly not what I expected given the credentials of the author.  The art-work was excellent but the text was interesting in places and insufficient in others.  The History Channel did a far better job of explaining the Templar phenomenon than did this book.  His ending was presumptous in his analysis...the Templars were unique and shouldn't be judged with 21st century morality. 
 AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.  	If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"   	At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.  	Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane 
 When the internal rechargable battery dies so does the unit. The power cord will not power the shaver once the battery can no longer hold a charge.   You cannot replace the regargable battery yourself! Sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one. As for the shave: not bad, but not exceptional either. The cutters a very tiny, not built to last, and are not durable. All rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions on how they are used. This shaver may last you a few months - a year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch.  I also have a braun and a norelco, the norelco is 10years old and running fine, the braun is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil - I heavy duty clean them in 97% alchohol about once a year, and brush out debris about once every 7 uses, these units dont have batteries and this is why I purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available. The Remington shaver really needs to have it's cutter blades cleaned (brushed off or washed) after every use (what a Pain)! I find this shaver to be a waste of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver - than one that will last 
 GOOD VOICE, BUT IF U WANT GOOD VOICE AND BETTER SONGS MY PICK WOULD BE BONNIE TYLER 
 Got this for my nephew for his birthday.  One week later (4 uses) it was broken.  He still uses the cup - my brother tried to fix it - nothing.  Would not recommend unless you want a cup only.  Again - concept great but it didn't hold up after 4 uses 
 The advice he gives men and women is ludicrious.There again  working off sterotypes.No one in this day and age should be  told it's ok to have random sex.Of course he aims this at the male because it his warped mind only men go on a ramage after  a bad relationship.Women do too but it's left out of the book because as we all know he believes women are love starved  junkies only craving romantic attention and romance.He also believes,wrongly,that women are the most hurt,oh yes,that  self worth and waves coming again at the woman.He views women as somehow half a person without a relationship while a man can build up himself financially and socially,if not sexually after a break up.Women are the downtrodden in his view,the victims. Save the poor little women from themselves is what I hear coming from him.When it comes to men,he is right there ready for an ego boost saying,you can do it.He comes across as an over protective father with the women.He has some need to see women as needy,pathetic love junkies 
 I bought the book on impulse... the title caught my eye, the first story was very interesting, AND the book was small enough to fit neatly into my tote bag...Big Mistake. I loved the first story,( the one about the family that had a child die in the snow and wasn't found until spring) second story I thought was odd but finished it anyway. Third story I was saying "whattt is he is talking about? didn't finish that one... fourth up struggled through that one. Fifth story, again I just couldn't make head nor tails about it.After that, feeling very let down and disapointed I put it away. I went  back to my local INDEPENDENT book store, threw myself at their mercy and they let me return it. PHEW 
 Like every other diet book out there: her argument boils down to:  Eat right Exercise  She's a hypocrite. She goes on and on about how evil the diet industry is and how she's one of us because she was once fat. Fine: great. But half her arguements I'm not buying: No one fact checks books anymore.  Also, the book is still fixated on fat. Recently, we learned that it isn't just fat that makes us fat. Look at a bag of sugar: if I eat that, will I not gain a pound? It's fat free...  Great Susan: how do we stop the insanity? First: EAT WHATEVER YOU WANT (as long as it's health food) Second: EXERCISE Third: BREATHE (I think this is just filler cuz she didn't have anything else to offer).  Instead of starving ourselves, we're to go to a chart of how many calories we're to expend a day. That's still cutting calories.   Also, lumping OA into the diet industry is wrong: it's not for profit. Taking people out for a walk instead of going to an OA meeting is like taking raging alcoholics out for coffee instead of attending an AA meeting. A temporary solution to an underlying problem. Didn't susan later have some sort of substance abuse problem too? Methinks the lady doth protest too much...  She's gotten all her little droogs to write raving comentaries on her book: but who the hell has heard of Susan Powter in the last 10 years. NO ONE!! SA's a flash in the pan.   Here's the scoop: eat right and exercise. Now pay me a billion dollars cuz I'm telling you "the truth. 
 This actually could have been a very watchable movie; Anthony Hopkins would be excellent anytime.  Micky Rourke is better than usual.  Mimi rogers is great.  two things make it not so good.  Comparing this to the original; there just isn't a comparison.  & Lindsay Crouse...oh man, she's painful in this one.  she has a very, I mean very, bad southern accent & it ruins the film

I regularly shop for awards/trophys and I couldn't imagine a pretty case with plate gold finish costing more than 80 bucks thats 287.93 You could still take your sweetheart to the movies and Benigans for some baked potato soup for this inflated price. I'm not sure .. But I don't THINK this case is platinum, makes you look any younger, make you fly or will help you sleep better so .. I think I've made my point 
 Marry anne's dad and Dawn's mom get married.  This is a good book to read but would you really be that happy to have to move into a house with your best friend?  And I know I would not want my dad to marry my best friend's  mom especially if she had been divorced before.  But overall it is a good  book that goes pretty quickly 
 Playmobil toys are wonderful, no question, but the more elaborate they are, the more problematic.   This ship is gorgeous and has great detail, including real string rigging.  This toy took forever to assemble, especially that pesky rigging,  with the usually excellent insrtuctions falling short.   After about a day of playing, my two boys had dismantled the ship enough that it wasn't fun anymore, and after three days I could no longer get all the parts back together.  It is now a somewhat expensive box filler.  The other Playmobil Pirate sets are still much loved, and have been conscripted on the nearly invincible Good Ship Fisher-Price 
 It either pulls your hair into it, or if you have thin hair it wont stay on at all. Then you find the gems on the floor (because they fall out) after you've stepped on it! OUCH 
 This movie is one of those "just for entertainment" category films. The plot is simple and the story is sort of interesting. Well, it was interesting to me. I'm sure that lots of folks will think it's goofy. Watch it if you have nothing better to do. 
 As said by other reviewers, a lot of what was in the original story was changed, and the film was updated to the time period where it was. The boys are American, from a military school, and talk about fear of the Russians snatching them up and drafting them for their athletic teams. The choice of making them from a military school may have been a poor choice - it may have hurt the belief of the transition from normal boys to animals. I don't want to sound like I'm stereotyping people in the military, but people in general already think there's a thin line between military experience in matters of war and the feelings of a wild animal.  Basically, I think the biggest problem with this film is that the storytelling is lost. You don't feel like there's a transition to barbarism like you did in the book and the 1963 film. For example, during the bonfire sequence Jack is shouting out directions: "OK, you be the pig, we'll be the hunters," and everyone chases the selected kid around the fire. (not actually hurting him, mind you, just chasing him) That's not chaos nor barbarism, that's an organized celebration. It's about as uncivilized as a frathouse orientation. The director tries to play this scene out like it's a terrible thing, but it just doesn't come across that way.  I might also add that this shares a similar problem with another modern adaptation, that being the John Hurt "1984." That film, if I recall correctly, didn't have a single "Big Brother is Watching You." Likewise, this film doesn't have a single, "Kill the pig, spill her blood!" That's right, the most famous line from the book is not even in this movie. Actually, a kid in one scene says quietly, "We killed a pig." That's about it. This leaves out an important part in the transition of the children from civilization to animal-like behavior. The fact the boys relished in the killing of a wild animal, chanting and screaming, "KILL THE PIG! SLIT HER THROAT! SPILL HER BLOOD!" was one of the most poignant moments of the book and 1963 film, and is one of the most recognizable literary quotes next to "Tell me about the rabbits, George."  On a final note, the character of Piggy is ruined in this film. Danuel Pipoly was terrible in the role, and sounds like he was plucked from an elementary school play. I don't wanna give too much away, but I was happy when "something something" happened to him. That sounds mean but it's true, and it's a very bad thing in a film like this.  This film could have been good, but it fails on all levels. The transition from schoolboys to animalistic roots is unbelievable, making the whole point of the story lost on the audience. The best part of the whole thing to me was that marine at the end, and he's in about ten seconds of film time. I hate comparing it to the 1963 film version so much, but I would really suggest people see that instead. Avoid this unless you can catch it on cable and watch at your own discretion 
 The worst book ever written about the Middle East is probably Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial; in this book Alan Dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from Peters, he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so.  The man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of International Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Resolutions.  His defending of nation states, however, is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable.  Joan Peters' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by Norman Finkelstein, and even the most ardent of Zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless.  20 years after that book faded into oblivion, Alan Dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own.  For a full documentation of this plagiarism, see Norman Finkelstein's personal website.  By writing this book, Dershowitz has inflicted more damage on Israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could.  Any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy The Case for Israel really is; both the book and the `case' that Dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies, bigoted arguments, idiocies, misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams. 
 Typical retro glam tripe that made me stop listening to them after "13 Above The Night."  They've lost their way and explains why they've lost band members.  Go listen to "Electric Hellfire Club" if you miss the good old days of "Cuz It's Hot" and "Kooler Than Jesus."  This sissy junk has nothing to do with why they started in the first place 
 This book is written in a very "folksy" style.  The author does provide instructions for constructing "home-made" filters and other types of equipment.  Regrettably, the paperback version of this book seems to be a xerox copy of the original hardcover edition.  All of the pictures are blobs of black and gray, which renders them essentially useless 
 Had the Reese Sleeved lock on my Tow Hitch Step  for a year now & damn if I can get the thing off !!!  We have tried Graphite (dry) Graphite Liquid everything short of cutting the thing off. The key  (a flat one) won't BUDGE in the lock.    Newer Reese towpower locks have round keys (like Vending machine keys) on them.  My cover has been on the lock ever since I bought it & today it is 87 degrees outside. Still the lock won't allow the key to turn in it. after 10 minutes of working on it with the CTP keys it budged a little, but it still didn't unlock ALL the way.   Tomorrow I am going to get my Custom Truck specialist to torch it off. Next time I will buy the MASTERLOCK  Brand. 
 A Hollywood movie type of book full of superficial evidences and self-fulfilling arguments. The writers are indeed experienced journalists who well understand that sensationalism sells. In terms of misleading  people, Western "free" media do the job as well as communist  propaganda machines. This book has further deepened the misunderstanding  between the people of the two nations. By the way, have Americans ever  thought about how many other nations in the world view the USA as the major  threat to their security and cultures 
 This is horrible to the point of tears. This CD is career ruining. If this were widely released (was it?), I don't know if we would be seeing the AMAZINGLY talented girl we see now. Stripped & Back to Basics are NOTHING short of IMPRESSIVE. I can't IMAGE the music industry without this talent, so thank GOD this wasn't released! WOW!!! 1 star because there isn't a "0" option! Sorry Christina 
 we used this book for undergrad se classes i taught. unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives. (we *also* used buede for another class and mandel for project management etc).  the authors know their stuff, unfortunately some of it got lost in translation.   perhaps because a lot of the material got translated from govt publications.   this is more like a handbook than a textbook.  for the handbook user just get sage's tome.  for a textbook -- well this is least worst for an intro to SE.  for supporting areas other books are better.   what is good is excellent.  but what is bad is frustrating.  they tried to cover way too much in one book and got confused with SE and OR and management techniques and quality and a whole bunch of other stuff that is really tangential to SE.   and the material  gets covered at uneven levels of detail so it is not a good handbook nor a good textbook just a good pile of notes on a lot of se related stuff.   previous editions had many errors and did not come with any answers to the problems, many of which were confusing as stated.   the first part of the book really introduces SE.  The rest of the book is for review by someone who has specialised in the areas they cover.   The book would be much better if they concentrated on SE and left the other stuff to other books.  i have not checked with the publisher for current availability,  but previously there was no instructors guide and no answers to the questions.  that is a big drawback for classroom use.    this would be best for an experienced person who wanted to review SE or get an introduction to a specialised topic relating to SE.  the dsmc/dau se handbook is (was?) free on the internet from various govt sites and does a great job of introducing SE.  you should look at that resource before buying this book.  indeed, unless you are using it in a class you might just want to borrow this from a library instead of buying it.      
 What a horrible book! The concepts in this book are incredibly unrealistic.  I cannot believe that this book was a required read for a college course 
 The cover and title sure does fool you.  Best Friends.  Looked like a great book for people like me that enjoy stories about how friends meet and make their journey through life together.  But this book was confusing as far as jumping around.  Porn?  Come on, give me a break.  This book is freakish, yet I read the whole thing... too long and I yet have to know what the entire point of the book was.  These characters were disturbing to me and instead of the title "Best Friends"... try "Selfish Psychos".  Do not waste your time and get this book.  If you are truly interested, see if your local library has it... that way you save your money.  Most terrible book EVER!  OH and my copy of the book had sections to where the letter "x" was replaced by the letter "y".  Nice proofreading 
 Having been a fan of Antonia Fraser for many years, I highly anticipated her biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. She depicts Marie-Antoinette's mother Empress Maria Theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to France at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. What startled me most is that Fraser not only insists on Antoinette having an affair with Count Axel von Fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that Axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. It seems to me that Marie-Antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister Caroline went on to have eleven children or more. She was also a devout Catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. In this case Fraser is applying the morals of some British aristocratic ladies to a queen of France. If Marie-Antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. With all of her enemies at Court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. On a smaller scale, Fraser makes ridiculous assertions about Marie-Antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that I have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; I have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. Not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where Lady Fraser's life ends and where Marie-Antoinette's life begins. I found it offensive that at the end Fraser interprets Marie-Antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. Especially, since Marie-Antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and Napoleon crowning himslf emperor. Sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the English language. One can only hope that the works of Bertieres, Chalon, and Delorme will soon be translated and published in English. Fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than Lever's travesty 
 what to write? the book is kinda story book, and gives passages after passages. if you are looking for a book that gives exercises to develop your psychic power, this one's not for you 
 I found the book "A Gathering of Days" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me. 
 As I am reading this book, I'm going "huh?" and "what does that mean?" and "this is like poetry, apparently..."  I can't say I liked the writing style (such as it is), but it did create word pictures and pulses inside me despite my desire not to like the book!  It is a mood piece, at least to me.  Not a writer I would buy again though.  Sorry 
 GOOD SONGS ___________  It's My Life First Cut Is The Deepest I Hate Everything About You Falls On Me 100 Years  ...and that's about it...I guess Beyonce is okay, but I like her better in DC.  UPDATE - 8/3/05: I should also comment that Jhonny Mendez's prediction list for Now 20 is flawless.  1)Beyonce`s Child-Nothin` no more  2)Britney Spears-My LAST song  3)N` Sync-Retarted as ever  4)Natalie Albino-Yes, I splited from nina sky,for the 76th time.  5)Madonna-American Life pt 2  6)Snoop Dogg-Strip Down  7)Hilary Duff-I followed the same steps as Britney Spears and now im a hoe.  8)Jojo-Im not famous anynore  9)Bjork-Thonin ahi yah tahdo sas  10)Ashanti-Oops!I did it over again. 
 Very slow book, very predictable, oddly written (sometimes I had to reread a sentence a few times just because it sounded so odd). 
 OK- the 1st time I heard of Gaitskill was when I saw Secretary & that was based on her story in "Bad Behavior". "Bad Behavior" I thought was mediocre, but had some potential. This book I found terribly dull. The characters are cliched abuse cases & the situations are predictable. The one story from where the title is taken is about a 16 yr old runaway who baby sits for a mother who never comes home that night. Then that's it. The conversations are not insightful, in fact there's really not much to say about them at all. I felt this was a very lazy book. For a better read, I recommend Emily Carter's "Glory Goes and Gets Some." While not all the stories are great, many are very good & the books have similar tropes- with Carter's dealing with someone with HIV/drugs & Gaitskill's with sex & whatever else. Yet Carter's is far superior because her descriptions are much more insightful & the characters more developed. Just goes to show you how it's not the subject matter, but the way something is written that makes it work 
 Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :- 
 This was one of the only books that I did not enjoy in this series. It was boring and took forever for me to finish 
 While watching this film, I found myself irritated with the whining and bickering that goes on, and wondering how it could have been better.  HANGING UP tells the tale of three sisters: Meg Ryan is Eve, the bulwark of the family, runs her own business; Diane Keaton as Georgia has her own self titled magazine; and Lisa Kudrow is Matty, the somewhat vapid soap opera actress.  Their elderly father (Walter Matthau in his last movie role) is having memory problems, can't walk and is admitted to a hospital.  He is going to die.  Ryan is the daughter who is saddled with the responsibility of her father, while the other two are too self-centered to even care.  All of this could have made for a compelling "dramedy" but director Keaton allows over emoting and all that conflict to override the gentler side of losing a parent.  And Matthau is not all that likeable either.  Cloris Leachman has a brief appearance as his ex-wife and Adam Arkin is Ryan's globetrotting husband.  It's surprising that the most honest moment in the film comes in a brief sequence between Ryan and the mother of a doctor whose car she crashed into in the hospital parking garage.  Ryan tries gamely to hold the movie together and although she is quite good, she can't really salvage the film.  Keaton and Kudrow are both adequate, but no depth is observed.  Matthau is more like Matthau than a true character and it's sad that his last role is so unlikeable.  HANGING UP tries to tackle sensitive and real issues but it's so contrived it fails 
 After reading the great reviews of this book, I was eager to start learning Italian in anticipation of a trip to Italy. What a disappointment this book is. In the introduction of this book it says, "You don't want to have to memorize long lists of vocabulary words or a bunch of boring grammar rules." It then goes on to do just that: lists and rules to memorize from pages 9 to 40. It is indeed boring. If you have to buy this book for some reason, skip these pages, and go back after you've read Chapter 3: Bongiorno! Meeting and Greeting 
 The only thing I got from this book, other than the fact that Johnny Damon thinks very, very, very highly of himself, is that anyone can get a book published...even if there is no meaningful content! I love the Red Sox and I still love Johhny Damon as a baseball player, but as an author, Mighty Johnny has struck out 
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 I don't know how this works because when I found that I would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work, I returned it. It isn't evident in the advert for this (or any other) heart-rate monitor. I guess I'll have to trust my sense of pain... 
 The back cover of the book says this book will teach Christians to confidently argue against evolution. And there is no doubt neither that Hanegraaf is confident nor that this book will appeal only to Christians, and only to those Christians who are not willing to think rationally and question their beliefs.   Hanegraaf states that the most significant consequence of the theory of evolution "is that it undermines the very foundation of Christianity", and that is the basis for his arguing throughout the book. His arguments are based on the notion that God's existance and the belief that God created the universe must never be questioned. He also argues that believing in the Bible is comforting because you know where you're going, while if you believe in evolution you don't know where the world is headed. This type of arguments are completely unscientific. Science is about what you can prove, not about what you find convenient and comforting to believe.   Hanegraaf obviously has no scientific integrity whatsoever. He has decided that evolution must be wrong, not because he can say anything to disprove it, but simply because it is against the Bible, and he has filled the entire book with this flawed and unscientific rhetoric. No reader - evolutionist or not - with any scientific integrity will be able to take this book seriously. It is completely faith based preaching for the choir, not worth wasting time or money on 
 I also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months.  I REALLY loved this machine though!  It actually blew air!  And it has the nice SAFE switches unlike the toggles that most have now.  I had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while I was gone and almost burned the place down.  So anyway, I'm trying to contact the manufacturer, but I doubt it will do any good.  Too bad.  Loved it while it worked.  Hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before I saw the reviews 
 I should have read the other reviews before I purchased this one. I not only wasted my time, but my MONEY ordering this book.  The book is written from a sarcastic view point about everything.  Nothing of substance.  I be sure to stay clear of future Dave Barry books.    Don't waste your time on this one!!!!!!!!!!! 
 UGH! This book was awful - even for a summer beach read. I would not waste my time again on this book. Cute concept, cute characters, but zero plot. BORING! 
 I agree with the premises of this book, but found it rather boring, and not the easiest to read. If you want to read something similar that doesn't read like a textbook, I would suggest "Losing Faith in Faith", "Atheist Universe" or "Like Rolling Uphill." 
 I got this movie on sale a couple years ago.  It looked pretty good, but you know how most of that goes.  I really lke movies like Scream, I thought it would be like that, but nope.  This movie was a hundred percent perdictable.  I knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie.  From the first seen you can tell it's gonna suck.  *Spoiler* The first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway, when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out.  The lights flicker (Wow how original) and a person... in a really, really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax.  This is what happens throughout the entire movie.  Don't waste your time or money.  If you really want to see it i would suggest renting it... not worth more than 3.00 anytime 
    Reading this book one encounters some information about pagan male deities, but it is presented in a manner "dry" and somewhat disorganized, just a collection of facts which seem to have been taken out of an encyclopedia, like a kid's homework. A more "humane" depiction of the God of the witches, is to be found in starhawk's spiral dance, it is inspired, poetic and it helps the practitioner to understand better, and attune to the horned God.    Even though some of the rituals presented in this book are of interest I only gave it one star because in the section appertaining "the war God", the authors have the ridiculous arrogance of retiring the God mars! and even write: "But war Gods today we can do without" and "we would do well to reject firmly mars", so according to this people, people from the aries sign, (such as myself), the holy sephira Gebura,( which despite their folly is holy) and those born under the influence of the "red ray" should not exist! For a practitioner, to think that he/she is wiser than deity, is the first step in the path of self destruction, one shouldn't forget the story of Lucifer, although I'am a witch,there is always wisdom to be found in the theology and parables of other religions.Having seen that woman in a video (Janet Farrar) and observing her demeanor, it is not difficult to realize that she probably thinks she can tell the Gods what to do and even retire them!   Their anti-war position of this people is an impracticable utopia, a dangerous delusion which is only likely to create imbalance in the microcosm and in the macrocosm and render the practitioner vulnerable to forces darker than he can possibly imagine 
    This movie is just terrible; even more than MOST of the predictably terrible films in this genre.  Women with terrible haircuts, dirty homes filled with poor taste in furniture, jobs a 16 year old would have - or no jobs at all, awkward behavior, barely able to function socially...UH+GH!  The truth is, there are gay women out there who look great, have beautiful homes, have very progressive and meaningful careers, have talent and are entertaining and sexy.  WHO SAYS this is representative??  Not in MY world it isn't.  I am so sick of these painful displays of us.  Anyone who gave it over 2 stars is childishly defending the genre in general, and not talking about this stinker of a film.        The filming is poor, the sound is dull...don't waste your time.  
 This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there 
 I was forced to read this in 10th grade but could hardly bear reading it.  Initially, I'd had high hopes for it, because we'd read such intelligent, intriguing novels earlier in the year, including "Lord of the Flies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  But what a bore it was! Old Santiago goes out to fish, hoping to catch the "big one" (drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best, biggest thing.."that must mean I'm macho, a real man!"), blah blah blah, can't catch anything, blah blah blah, and when he finally catches the big one, it is eaten by sharks. The stupidest book ever. I've never been a Hemingway fan, and this book steered me further away from his work.  A pathetic book by a pathetic man 
 I laughed a few times in this movie but was more annoyed then anything..I was left with a horrible feeling in me after the movie was over..If I wanted a downer of a ending I could just go out and watch the the different [...] that happens in the world....I waited for a long time to rent this movie, now I wish I never had rented this movie because my money I spent will go to support movies like this....What a waste of time....BBBBOOOOOOOO!!!!! All the hype was built up into a bowl of [...].... 
 I  liked Yate's novel "Revolutionary Road" very much, but found Easter Parade  disappointing. Lots happens in a short book, and Yates exhibits the clean, simple prose style of a good crime writer. Looking back, at the end of the novel, I was touched by all the fruitless effort Emily Grimes had put into establishing a satisfying long term relationship, only to be thwarted by the limitations of the men in her life.  Yet Yates is really writing about people, not making them come alive as well developed characters.  When Emily turns her back on her sister, which should be a major event, it is almost casually dismissed.  "The Easter Parade" is readable, but it is not good literature. 
 The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products 
 I saw this movie in the mid-80s at a porno theatre on a double bill w/ The Decline of Western Civilization.An interesting experience-all through the movies middle aged men would furtively enter,watch the screen for 10-15 minutes and go to the other theatre.I'm not sure that they didn't have the right idea. There are,indeed, wonderful clips of live Clash,a wonderful band. But most of the movie follows the mind numbing adventures of a moron who somehow falls into a job as a roadie for the Clash.The band members themselves later largely disavowed the movie and it isn't hard to understand why.I am a rabid Clash fan,but there's no way that I could justify paying the price for this movie just to watch 15-20 minutes of the Clash.It is a tragedy that this band,one of the most exciting bands in the history of rock,doesn't yet have a good concert film. Joe Strummer's death may cause the surviving band members to go through the archives to put together a documentary that shows the band performing live.Until that happens I guess this is better than nothing, but not much. Mick? Paul? Do you read these reviews? Your fans deserve better that this! Whip out a real concert movie 
 The book has scientific value, but distorts findings to make  conclusions.   If you are searching to fulfill yourself spiritually, this is not a book for you.  You can make peace with your God, whichever religion, by simply listening to your soul...However, if you love pseudo-fiction sci-fi, eat this book up - its a buffet 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 In a time when reformed theology is on the rise, Pinnock and his co-authors seek to provide an Arminian understanding of Scripture.  However, the book is strewn with problems.  The authors claim that God's love trumps other attributes like holiness and justice, but they give no scriptural support.  Their arguments are based simply on our western sense of fairness.  They make such appeals because they believe our moral sense reflects truth, instead of recognizing our fallen nature.  In addition, they advocate "making peace with the culture of modernity" (27).  Instead of letting God's Word shape our thinking, they allow our lost culture to shape our view of God's Word.    The result is a presentation of a weak, helpless God.  In fact, the authors state "it is more important for God to give himself to his creation than to rule the world or to be worshipped" (35).  He is described not as ruling, but as "limited by humanity" (40) , vulnerable, and "the defenseless superior power" (175).  The book has weak, humanistic argumentation, little scriptural support, and a harsh tone toward those who embrace reformed views, views said to be "theologically repugnant" (84).  Do not waste your time with this book.  While there are legitimate differences between Arminian and Calvinistic views and a place for dialogue, this book does not give dialogue but instead gives unsubstantiated claims that leave you with a helpless God not in control and not worthy of worship.    In case you do not know, the editor of this book embraces the view that God does not know the future.  
 As a Maiden fan for 20+ years, I've spent many an hour singing along and banging my head to one of the best bands that metal has ever offered up. I don't even consider this a Maiden album, but it is so I have to compare it to the rest of the catalog. Blaze's voice is so flat and boring that it's amazing nobody questioned it during the recording/mixing; just listen to him saying "Falling down" on Man On The Edge. Paul Dianno didn't have half the range as Bruce, but he pulled it off just fine. The other thing I've noticed is that the compositions aren't up to the normal Maiden level. It seems like Steve just really wasn't into it or maybe he just lost inspiration. I'm not going to rip this album apart because it's just a small blip on the the legacy of a band that I couldn't hold any higher regard for. 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 Please, if you want to waste your time and money buy this book. Sincerely, this book does not say anything valuable or new. There is a program (for free) RF-popHR made in 1998 that calculate these claimed kabalistic hours and you do not need the book for anything (I remark, for anything). The only thing you have to do is to adjust the hour playing with Time Zones in using a good ephemeris as Suncycle program (also shareware) 
 because it is bullshirt, cashing in on America's eager ignorace like Steyn and Coulter and company. You never went broke underestimating US prejudice and hate.  This book must be taken for what it is, a propaganda sheet of the MacArthyite stripe not worth the paper it was printed on, full of unfounded and fallacious argumentation to please the most ignorant consumer.  A thin volume. Do not waste that hard earned dollar we suffer so much to gain under the horror of bushanomics. Save it for your children's college tuition instead.   Do you really think anyone but television brainwashes kids nowadays? And who owns that? Rupert Murdoch. Do you really think they are awake enough in the classroom to care what the professor is saying? Especially one who challenges them by cartesian methodology to begin to THINK for once, to question, to investigate, to discover truth, to try parallax and other perspectives?  This book dictates. Learning expands. Education draws forth. Save your buck for a good college education.  This book dictates what texts we may read and not read and forbids the most influential philosophers and writers of the twentieth and nineteenth century, including Darwin. Next up: James Joyce for being inscrutable to SHapiro's very limited and uneducated perception. And God forbid he should ever see the New TEstament, as he would immediately declare it verbotten from any college campus for proposing we treat others as we wish to be treated, and to love our enemies and do good to those who harm us, as he finds no profit in peace. 
 I don't need "MISFITS" wannabe's in the good ol' united states so I definetely dont need some woah woah ooh crap sung in japanese! Buy Earth a.d., Static Age,Walk Among Us,Legacy of Brutality or hell even Evilive to see what these losers wish they were. Just cause your songs are like fater than hell doesn't mean their good 
 Cassie is a real cutie no doubt but she can't sing period. I've heard crying infants that sound better than this young lady. The album has some decent music but the vocals that are laid over the music are atrocious! Cassie's voice makes me cringe similar to listening to someone scratch a chalkboard. I would never buy this album. I like the way cassie looks so instead of buying her album I will download a picture instead 
 Having regularly read "Bicycling" for many years (even when it was called "Bicycling!" in a tasteless 1970s way), I find it surprising to see how much the quality of the magazine has declined. In spite of all those people spending huge amounts of money on fancy equipment, "Bicycling" has become thinner and thinner. It has recently improved somewhat, after most of the editorial staff was fired, and a sign is the dropping of the truly horrible marginal comments (Bike Love and so forth) but it is only suitable for real neophytes. Unfortunately, there is no other single magazine that covers racing, bike touring, test reviews, technique and fitness in North America, no matter how poorly. The articles are very short and sometimes, well, just stupid. There is very little on cycling destinations or serious equipment tests. The photography remains decent, but compared to the German magazine "Tour," for example, "Bicycling" is a pretty sad effort. If you can read this, you have access to the Internet, which means you have far better sources of information to draw on. I am letting my subscription lapse and advise you to save your money. A big disappointment, "Bicycling" has not advanced with its readers

 This is an amazing example of what I've only heard about heretofore:  The feminist attribution of motives that probably didn't even enter the minds of the plantation ladies Ms. Clinton has written about. Her research sample is small and perhaps overused, but quite interesting when letters are included in the text, and therefore there is some worth to the work.  Often foolish, this book says more about the author's politics than the lives of plantation mistresses 
 i tried really hard to like this album.  i can't do it.  every one of the songs is tedious and anti-catchy.  they're like nails on a chalk board.  i saw thursday in concert a couple of months ago and people didn't seem to know what to do during their new songs.  typically a good song will make you want to tap your foot at a minimum.  this album makes you want to set yourself on fire 
 I don't really know what to say about this book. It's shocking and sad. It has summaries of horrible pogroms and covert ops gone really bad. I think the presentation just wasn't as good as I expected. The book even seems a little emotional. Granted, the author is talking about issues that are sensitive and morally significant. It just appears frustration gets the best of him sometimes in the book and that makes his "objectivity" suspect 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 Ok this book is utter [crud]. It starts off ok with an introduction suggesting that something interesting will happen but unfortunetly it rapidly goes down hill. The chacrthers are dull and predictable, there is an awful lot of senseless babbling (talking about painting orasnges orange for 3 pages? oh gosh!) and no rel action. The ending tries to be shocking but is predictable and dull. This is the exact opposite of mice and men. Mice and men is a quick fast pace book with lots of action, interesting charcthers and humour. Thi is [bad]. AVoid at all costs. This really doesn't even desevere a 1 but I couldn't find -999999999999 so this will d 
 I purchased this book so that I might learn more about the linking process. I had hoped that I could write my own simple linker to help facilitate my understanding. Interestingly enough, this is exactly what the book advertises. Unfortunately this book only served as a mild introduction to several object file formats. Like mathematicians need formulas to understand certain processes, programmers need code to see what is actually is transpiring within the computer. This book does not contain anything technical enough that could actually be helpful in writing your own linker (providing you already understand object file formats). If this book was entitled "Introduction to Object Files" then I may have given it 5 stars. The book also has several references to writing a linker in PERL, but the website has not changed since it was published in October of 1999. No code has yet been posted and has left me with the feeling of being ripped off. The books website.... contains a draft version of the book. I'd suggest you simply read that and save your money. I don't think its fair to release half a product at full price. Being a student, money doesn't come by easily for me. I am certain I will never buy a book from Jonh R. Levine again 
 I. Impossible to be acceptably used to scan documents to .pdf.  a) If you scan from Adobe Acrobat Standard, you cannot stop the HP driver from cutting out parts of the image it considers negligible;  b) If you scan from Adobe Acrobat Standard, all colors will be grey;  c) If you scan from HP Director, files will be 4 times the normal size (e.g. 3 Mb file with Adobe Acrobat Standard, 12 Mb with HP Director; no way to downsize it). 
 The ceramic is slightly cheap and the lid doesn't fit properly so it's kind of pointless because it is a travel mug! The cobalt blue is a nice colour.  I bought another mug through Creative Ventures through Amazon and it was cheaper and the quality was much better 
 This product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs. The tech support emailed that any CD or DVD copy software had to be removed. I guess that sort of makes a DVD or CD R/W drive rather pointless. I removed the copy software and still have bad results. About 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it.  Maybe it doesn't like my corporate virus protection. I find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky. I rate this product as totally useless. 
 This is a good example of a book written by an author who just wanted to "write" and finish a book. I doubt if the author really knows the subject.  For example, in page 745,the section titled "What About Tasks?", the code example does not include task assignement, and he writes "You can attempt to code task recurrence and assignement, but this is much harder and can easily break Outlook if done incorrectly. For this reason, these functions are not shown in the following code because they are complex and prone to breaking Outlook". Funny. The author should attempt to explain how to do it correctly.   Outlook object properties, methods and events. The author enumerates all of them, no explanation. For example, page 170, about UserProperties and UserProperty, I saw a lot of these properties in his sample codes, but there are never any explanation what are these!  When he explained things, most are self-explanatory. For example in page 82 about "Setting the Actions for a Rule", he wrote" Return to Sender - This action sends an item e-mailed to a folder back to a sender.... Delete - This action deletes an item... Reply - With This action sends an automatic reply... Forward - This action forwards all messages...  He shows how to create custom field (it's easy) but never explained how to access them programmatically.  It will take a whole book as big as this one to comment how disappointing this book is. It is much better to search msdn than read this book 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 I am a big Percy Blakeney/Scarlet Pimpernel fan and have read Orczy's book at least 3 times.  Based on the strength of a customer review on this webpage, I purchased the boxed DVD edition, featuring Richard E. Grant & Elizabeth McGovern.  The scripts were written by Richard Carpenter.    I was VERY DISAPPOINTED by this screen version of the story.  I do NOT recommend it to any true Percy fan.  I have viewed 3 movie versions of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and this one is by far the worst.  Perhaps screen-writer Carpenter never read the book; perhaps he simply decided to take ENORMOUS LICENSE with the characters.  In either event, the script eliminated much of what was delightful about Orczy's Percy and turned Marguerite into a mild-mannered wimp without the wit or resources to save herself from her own stupid decisions.  Even worse, Marguerite was constantly in need of being rescued by her husband or, ironically, her former lover/the series villain, Chauvelin.  Here are some reasons for my conclusions:    Percy Blakeney, whom Orczy described in her book as the "master of disguise" never ONCE dons a disguise in this movie series (unless you consider wrapping a black scarf around the lower face a disguise).  And **HELLO!!** wouldn't the French be a tad bit suspicious of 3 black-cloaked, black-masked figures strutting around the streets of Paris in broad daylight?  (The French certainly arrested other characters for less!)  These scenes were so contrived, they were painful.  And yes, while it was certainly clever to have Percy escape ala James-Bond gadgetry -- this contrivance negated Orczy's portrayal of Percy as a man whose WIT was his first and primary weapon for defense and escape.  In fact, I found Percy (in this DVD collection) to be more fond of slicing and dicing enemies, than of using his unmatched cunning to save himself and his compatriots.  This twist on Percy was truly, truly disappointing -- the author must be turning in her grave.  As for the romance in Orczy's story...  Neither the actor nor the screen-writer were EVER able to convince me that Percy was the kind of man whom a woman (or a nation) could adore.  Richard E. Grant portrayed Percy as cold & verbally abusive to Marguerite.  Percy ridicules her publically several times -- and Marguerite's dialogue is written so that she never quite "gives" as good as she gets.    But Marguerite's dialogue is not the point.  THE POINT is that Percy, in the book, was a tormented man who loved a wife whome he feared he could not trust.  Never once did Grant's acting convey such breadth; his verbal sniping (as written and acted) was cruel and self-aggrandizing.  Even when Percy is supposed to be "play-acting" this ridicule of Marguerite in DVD #3 to set up a plot element later in the story, the contempt in the dialogue, as delivered by Grant, felt very REAL.  Screen-writer Carpenter's rendition of the so-called "romance" in this movie version touches the very uncomfortable theme of emotional abuse, especially through Grant's interpretation of the dialogue.  Rather than delivering his lines with subtlety (a nod to his hidden feelings of affection for his wife), Grant's Percy most often comes across as a high-handed male autocrat who expects Marguerite to submit meekly to his rule.  While this type of husband/wife relationship may have been historically accurate in 18th Century Britain, I do not believe that the Percy of Orczy's book would have handled himself in this way.  Indeed, Percy was supposed to be the consummate gentleman underneath all the frippery.  And he was supposed to be genuinely in love with his wife.  One of the rare, potentially romantic moments in DVD #1 was completely bungled by both leading actors.  Grant's one-liner about Marguerite being his "life" is delivered with such unbelievable dispassion that it borders on mockery.  (And please:  Marguerite's dimwitted mutterings about unrequited love at this crucial point in the plot -- when Percy is accusing her of complicity in a French family's murder -- was INSULTING to every woman of intelligence in the audience! I just wanted to throttle actress McGovern AND the screenwriter.)  Yes, yes, the original book hinged on this ongoing misunderstanding in the Blakeneys' marriage, but the dialogue could have been written and acted much better.  But if you don't consider the lack of plausible romantic elements a good reason to avoid this series, read on.  The problems with this verison of Orczy's Pimpernel go far beyond the love story.  For starters, Percy is often unsympathetic as a human being:  in addition to sniping at his wife and behaving in court like a smart-alecky prig, he shows a dearth of compassion at the death of his loyal lieutenant, Lord Anthony Dewhurst.  When Dewhurst is murdered by Chauvelin (in cold blood, I might add), Grant (and the scriptwriter) devote exactly 3 seconds to grief in DVD #1.  Grant cavalierly delivers the following dialogue: "Well, Tony knew the risks."  (And this Pimpernel is supposed to be a hero whom a nation adores?  Whom 20+ young British hotbloods would give up their LIVES for?! Sorry.  Didn't buy it.)  If Percy's casting was bad, Marguerite's was even worse.  In the book, Orczy's Marguerite was a flamboyant French actress, full of life and passion & hopelessly in love with a husband who, she believes in despair, no longer loves her.    In this DVD collection, Elizabeth McGovern most often appears as a frumpy hausfrau rather than a sparkling coquette.  McGovern played Marguerite without wit or common sense, & Carpenter's script didn't help.  For example:  Marguerite (a bourgeois who should have known better) tries to pass herself off at the gates of Paris as a seamstress.  Five seconds later, her lily-white, uncallused hands are inspected by the captain of the guard, and she is hauled off to prison.  Carpenter didn't even let Marguerite's character -- the consummate actress -- PROTEST this treatment, much less run, struggle, or attempt to bluff her way out of her predicament.  Marguerite simply walks off between her guards!!  (::groan::)  In DVD #2, she sits meekly in a convent, waiting for Madame Guillotine's troops to discover her and drag her away.  In DVD #3, she spies on 2 characters, learning the double-identity of the villain.  The villain leaves, but the sidekick remains; several minutes later, Marguerite returns from a chat with Percy to rummage through the villain's belongings.  At this point, neither the actress nor the screenwriter allow Marguerite the common sense to first SEARCH THE AREA FOR THE SIDEKICK to make sure that her snooping goes unobserved.  Naturally, this plot contrivance leads to Marguerite's capture later.  ::double groan::  I could go on and on about the characterization of Marguerite as a stupid female, but I'm sure you get the point.  And now you're probably wondering if there is ANYTHING to commend you to this series.  Well, yes, to be fair, there is:  Martin Shaw, who was cast as Chauvelin.    Shaw portrayed Chauvelin as a real human being with passions, prejudices, longings and yes, moments of real malice.  He also had occasional moments of nobility.  He gave the only consistent performance of real depth in this series.  Even in the scenes where Percy completely humiliated Chauvelin, either by word or by sword, Chauvelin somehow remained sympathetic, which, by contrast, left Percy either looking over-the-top arrogant or a tad bit cruel.  In general, the worst storyline of this series is on DVD #2.  MADAME GUILLOTINE has enough plot contrivances to gag an ox.  The 3rd DVD, THE KIDNAPPED KING, is by far the best of the series -- but, sadly, that isn't saying much.    If you're a glutton for punishment and you really MUST purchase this series, I recommend that you amuse yourself by watching the REALLY BAD ACTING of the extras in the crowd scenes (especially on DVD #1).  However, if you want to watch a REALLY GOOD version of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one that is faithful to Orczy's novel, view the 1980s version that stars Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour.  Andrews is comical AND heroic -- a man to fall in love with.  Seymour is a spunky, resourceful heroine that will make audiences cheer.  You might also enjoy the Leslie Howard version, with beautiful Merle Oberon as Marguerite, which was released in 1935.  Both actors do a credible job with Orczy's characters, and the script is faithful to her book.    Happy viewing 
 Alright, first off this piece of crap will randomly stop playing. It started off when I'd just walk around that it would turn off, but now sometimes I barely TOUCH IT and tilt it to the side to look at the song and it turns off.  It is NOT easy to use if you're a HOLD button person... if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer, it will not let you delete or add music, which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist. Also, the headphones that come with it are REALLY not worth it, they are really really bad, so go buy some nice Sony ones. AND, the song switcher thinger is a little defective... it's neat, but you can push it down and it'll hit something inside of the MP3 player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy... so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my MP3 player whenever its in my pocket or something. I think thats about it... I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want a cheap piece of s*** 
 Brick's biggest hit, "Dazz" is spectacular in its long version, with its whistling/flute combo which I've never heard before or since in any musical genre.  You'd think it would naturally be included on the greatest hits album, since they are essentially a one hit wonder.  No such luck, as this compilation contains the short radio version of the song.  "Dusic" is the only other song which is halfway decent, but hardly warrants shelling out $10.  What a disappointment.. 
 In the introduction (pg.6) Ms. Hoppen notes, that after 11 September..."a perfect show house no longer mattered. Having a home that really was a home that really was a home did." So I wonder why all the really gorgeous photographs in this book really do not demostrate that people actually live in these homes. The rooms are devoid of individual personality and really do appear to be perfect show rooms. Personal artifacts are removed from the photographs, replaced with props and items that are fabricated for Ms. Hoppen and for sale on links on her web sites or by the vendors listed in the "Address Book" section of her book (read product placement). With that said there are a worthwhile morsels in this book and the photographs are wonderful, especially if you are looking for interesting and minimal examples of door and window trim, floral arrangement ideas, or you are designing a spiral staircase.  The text portion of the book is very useful for the design process of building a home and the photographs seem to be blue prints come to life, but without any sentimental indications of the lives of the people who might be moving into these homes. The window treatment section should be licenced by Smith and Noble and used in their catelog. 
 This is one of those films I've been waiting to see for years.  Almost 27 years.  I love Disney, including their live-action films.  I'm a sci-fi fan.  I'm fascinated by the idea and theory of black holes.  Over the years, I've come to be a fan of Robert Forster, and I like the rest of the cast alright insofar as I'm familiar with their work.  Maybe it was all the anticipation, but I was extremely disappointed on finally watching The Black Hole.  It's pretty much a mess that's transparently derivative of a number of other films.  It feels like calculated product when you watch it.  And it has a very odd cast for a sci-fi film.  That could be a pleasant surprise, but here, it never stops feeling odd.  You get the feeling that everyone got lost on their way to sets for other films.  Or that it was some kind of quirky practical joke.  The script is another big problem.  You're plopped into the middle of the lives of a crew exploring deep space in a modest ship with little exposition.  We don't know when this is supposed to be, what the crew is supposed to be doing, really, or what their relationships are.  We just get plunged into a dilemma with lots of gobbledy-gooky dialogue and the kind of sci-fi physics for which many people would have nominated Armageddon (1998) for a Razzie, if only that were a category.  Of course, I don't mind fictional physics, but the spinning and lurching and all kinds of other, later events just tended to be ridiculous in a way that I wouldn't call "good".  In any event, I could have lived with that, and even with having to fill in big gaps of exposition inferentially, but there are other aspects of the script and the film in general that are more difficult to smooth over.  One thing that really drove me crazy was the floating R2-D2-ish robot whose speech capabilities consisted almost entirely of somewhat obliquely selected Bartlett's Quotations and clichés.  Robert Forster's character kept saying, "Right", in response to these, as if the robot had just explained some complicated scientific principle or otherwise said something profound.  Other people and robots got into the Bartlett's and clichés act later.  The script references a couple more technical aspects of black hole theory, like Einstein-Rosen Bridges, so someone had to at least crack open a book or a Scientific American article on black holes.  But not only is this mixed with the ridiculous literary pretense, but certain characters can communicate with each other via ESP, and this turns out to be a plot hinge later on.  So it's kinda new-age-fi as much as sci-fi.  Many elements and even entire scenes are "borrowed" from popular films.  For example, the robots, androids, and the atmosphere and militarism of Reinhardt's ship are straight out of Star Wars (1977), with a touch of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954).  The ending is straight out of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), ridiculously enough.  To its credit, The Black Hole managed to beat Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) by two years with what's essentially the "giant boulder scene", but that's not much to credit it with, especially given how much better Steven Spielberg uses the idea.  Unlike many other films, The Black Hole does not feel like it's paying homage to artistic influences in the above references.  It feels merely like it's trying to ape content that was commercially successful, to hopefully catch the tail end of a trend or two.  Similarly, there was an attempt to make two of the robots, V.I.N.CENT. and Bob, "cutesy" in a way that would especially appeal to kids.  Vincent likes to do loop-de-loops while he flies about uttering his bad dialogue and generally acting like a speech-capable R2-D2, with a similarly spinning "head" and various extensible and retractable gadgets.  More than cutesy, a lot of this and other material winds up being unintentionally humorous.  This is also true of the action sequences, such as the fight against the robots who can normally shoot moving targets with incredible predictive powers and accuracy, but when it's really important, who suddenly are unable to do anything but stand there like sitting ducks.  I just realized I haven't said anything at all positive about the film.  Hmmmm . . . well, even though it's pretty mucked up, the basic ideas in the film are intriguing--you can see them gleaming through the thick fog.  There is a lot of admirable visual design throughout.  I'm enough of a fan of Robert Forster that I still liked him here, despite the odd fit with the material, and Ernest Borgnine may seem lost, but he's a lot of fun--maybe because he seems lost.  If you watch The Black Hole in the right frame of mind, it's a pretty decent "So bad, it's good" film 
 This book is, unfortunately, suited more for "arm-chair" survivalists than people really seeking a working knowledge of wilderness survival skills. Most of the skills "covered" may help the inexperienced person feel confident until they actually attempt them. Case in point: Cordage or natural string...yes they cover it, but so sparingly as to be ineffective. "The inner bark of trees make the best fibers to use." (page 7-4) That is all it says about using bark. There is nothing about what trees are best, or how to harvest or prepare the bark. The bulk of the "skills" in this manual are lacking in a manner similar to that illustrated above. As a former soldier and a current survival instructor I can say with the utmost confidence that this book is good for starting fires and not much else. The lack of many details provides a challenge to anyone attempting to complete a skill from start to finish. Try it and you will see! Reviewers giving it high marks clearly have never been in a true survival situation. Thumbs down 
 Let me preface this by saying I am a big fan of traditional Irish music, and a huge fan of Dervish, Trian, Liz Carroll, Bothy Band, Kevin Burke, Andy Irvine, etc.  This is the first Solas CD I have bought, and will probably be the last.  Although generally very competently played, the music just doesn't speak to me.  I agree with the some of the other reviews to that effect that this Solas recording is too highly orchestrated, and not very traditional (though I don't mind that, per se).  In my opinion "Last of the Great Whales" has some of the lamest and simple-minded lyrics I've ever heard. Though she has a very pleasing voice, Ms. Scanlon's rendition of it just fails to move me whatsoever (lacking in musicality, I believe one reviewer said).  In my book her renditions just don't compare to Mary Black, Susan McKeown, or Karan Casey, though they are pleasant enough.  The fiddle playing on "A Little Child" reminds me more of a classical violinist playing Irish music....very good tone, but too much vibrato, and too orchestrated with multiple violin tracks sounding like the London Philharmonic (e.g. When My Love & I Parted).  On the positive side, there is some excellent guitar, flute, and button accordian playing on here (e.g. Cahil's Jig).  It's as if the band is trying too hard to distance themselves from the many other traditional Irish groups, with the result that the arrangements are overly complex, and the material just isn't that interesting 
 Schuller desires to take the reader down a feel-good road.  Unfortunately, the path is littered with little more than cliches and pop-psychology.  The text is a series of sound-bytes which is easily equalled or surpassed in most any book of collected quotations, or, if one prefers, a Google-search under choice key words.  The road signs of the book (i.e. the gist of the text) are 1) you feel unfulfilled; 2) don't worry, be happy; 3) oh yes, and God wants you to be happy.  All the road signs are supplemented with the above-mentioned sound-bytes and pop-psychology.  In keeping with the spirit of the book, I took the path and stopped at Schuller's lemon tree.  Unfortunately the lemons were not good.  I then tried to make lemonade.  Unfortunately the lemons were so bad that no amount of sweetner could make them palatable.  In fact, it became unhealthy.  I tried several other uses, but all were equally unproductive and unhealthy.  I began to wonder why--then I realized that lemon trees, in order to produce palatable fruit, must be trimmed regularly.  The lemon tree at the side of this particular road is in need of serious trimming.  There is better and more nutricious fruit to be found elsewhere.  Even the old cliche "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is of no use when the tree itself is no good.  It is this last part that Schuller fails to adequately address.  Too bad.  I strongly suggest you take a different and more scenic road that bears much better fruit 
 I've seen much better photos/articles on Dylan and would not suggest this particular work. I will be selling my copy in the used section.  
 Well, there are numerous reasons you wouldn't want to buy this book.  Number one it's shakespear which is literally a different language.  If you're not familiar with it, you will hate this book.  The author did put a page in every other page giving meanings of different texts and terms, though.  The good thing is it reads fast.  And for anyone who thinks comedy.  Not what you're thinkin.  In drama terms a comedy is a play with a happy ending.  A funny play wold be a farse.  Soo it's not really even the least bit funny if that's what ur thinkin.  The book as a whole is pretty short if you take out the definition pages and explanations of different things.  Maybe about a 100.  Really though, unless you have to for school don't waste any time on this book 
 First, let me say that I don't read tech books cover to cover.  I use them as a reference when I need info on a specific subject.  After buying this book, the first subject I needed info on is Terminal Services.  The editors must have been half asleep on this one.  There are 6 lines of text in this book on Terminal Services (page 68).  Under those 6 lines is a Note:    "Appendix A contains an overview of the way a terminal server works in Windows Server 2003."  I immediately flip to Appendix A.  I begin reading..."Appendix A: Internet Information Services 6.  DOH!"  Not a single word about Terminal Services in the Appendix.  I immediately lost my faith in this book, and I haven't looked at it since.  I can't comment on the rest of the book, because as I mentioned I haven't looked at the rest of it.  Some may say it is unfair to judge the book based on one subject area.  In my opinion, this is a major editing blunder.  The fact is, when I need answers I have to trust the source.  And after this, I don't trust this book 
 I'm not a big Apple Computer fan, but I was very disappointed by this book. Covering the tumultuous period just before Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the book attempts to provide all the 20/20 insight necessary to explain the company's short-comings. Unfortunately, though, the book is so poorly written -- and doesn't at all hide the disdain the author feels for Jobs -- that it's nearly unreadable. Rather than tell the story in a linear timeline, the book jumps back and forth in a very confusing way. If you didn't already know the Apple story, you wouldn't know what was going on.   Also, considering all the success Apple has had since then (with the iMac and Titanium PowerBook), this topic is moot now anyway 
 What a waste of $$, a book that uses a motorcycle brand name as though it was a generic term and is boring on top of that.  One good thing, this book shows that anybody can get any trash published 
 "Cursed" is the most pathetic werewolf movie I've seen since "An American Werewolf in Paris".  The acting is terrible, directing is poor (Shame on you Mr. Craven) and the storyline is largely uncompelling.  The werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience.  This movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is "cool", but if you're looking for a scary movie, don't look for "Cursed".  Well, at least it's not as bad as "An American Werewolf in Paris", but that sure as hell isn't saying much.  
 While this dictionary does contain a lot of entries, it is English to Arabic only; there is no Arabic to English.  It does however show the short vowels, though the script is a little frustratingly small.  I took it back once I found out it was only a one-way dictionary.  The Arabic Practical Dictionary by Hippocrene is much better (though it doesnt' show short vowels however) 
 Overall, I did enjoy reading this book.  I'm not sure though that I would recommend it to a friend.  I didn't feel a deep connection with any of the characters for the most part.  I was intrigued to see what would end up happening, so I found it to be a page-turner.  There was a lot of botany involved in which plants were referred to by their genus-species name.  I don't feel that was a necessity to the main plot.  
 DRUMMING is Steve Reich's longest work, two full discs of minimalist rhythms performed by an occasionally changing ensemble. This installment in Deutsche Grammophon's "Echo 20/21" series of contemporary music reissues provides a rare complete performance of the work with no cuts, recorded in 1974. In the end, I found "Drumming" to be minimalism at its worst.  During the late 1960s Steve Reich had worked in a studio for electronic music. In 1970 he visited Ghana, and there found confirmation of his suspicion that acoustic instrumentation contained all the possibilities of music by itself. Stylistically "Drumming" is a continuation and final refinement of the phasing technique that Reich had been working with since 1965. This is a process in which "two or three identical instruments playing the same repeating melodic pattern gradually move out of synchronization with each other." Yet, three new techniques are here. The first is that the timbre gradually changes while pitch and rhythm remain constant. The second is that the human voice is used to imitate the exact sound of the surrounding instruments in the ensemble. This has an effect similar to Ligeti's "Clocks and Clouds"). Since the glockenspiels are too high for the human voice to mimic, whistling accompanies the lower registers of the instrument, and a piccolo the higher. The third innovation is the process of substituting beats for rest or vice versa within a repetetive rhythmic cycle. Though there is development of the theme, there is yet only one basic rhythmic pattern for entire two discs of the work.  The ensemble is a showcase of early 1970s avant-garde performers. Cornelius Cardew, who went on to become England's first Maoist composer, plays marimba's here. I think that a similar section of Cardew's work "The Great Learning" (also in "Echo 20/21") is much, much more successful than "Drumming" and encourage all to check it out.  I admit it, I think minimalism is the greatest disaster to befall contemporary music, and has provided more charlatans than any other style. I prefer the zahlenmystik of Gubaidulina, the frenetic business of Lindberg, or even the academic dryness of the lab coat-wearing composer Boulez. Yet, I can appreciate some works of Reich. The other Reich disc in the Echo 21/21, with his "Variations for Winds, Strings, and Keyboards", "Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices, and Organ", and "Six Pianos" is quite enjoyable. "Drumming", on the other hand, is so dull that I felt no compulsion to return to it except the curiosity to know if there was something in there after all. Yet, after many listenings, I find that the work is still without any captivating qualities. The development of the music seems to take longer than in any other minimalist work, and two hours of music have a range so limited that you won't believe you just paid so much for this release.  I really cannot recommend this disc to anyone except those who, like me, are collecting all of the "Echo 20/21" series, or those who want to fill holes in their Reich collection. I was greatly disappointed by "Drumming" 
 Cheaply made and ill-fitting, this "deluxe" case isn't worth half the price.  There is no handle or wrist strap provided; your camera's strap becomes the carry handle.  A small, snap-strap is provided, but I can't figure out what it's for... the snap is easily unfastened with light pressure, and I wouldn't trust it to hold the weight of the empty case, much less with the heft of a camera inside.  Don't buy this item:  Amazon will not reimburse you for the return postage, because it's not their fault you don't like it... and you WILL be returning it.  Save yourself the trouble.  
 I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.    Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.  Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.  If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that.  That's why I give this one 2 stars 
 she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all 
 Very disappointing and BORing! NO likeable characters, VERY uninteresting story.  Could/Would not finish--too many "better" books waiting 
 I viewed this movie when I was young when it first came out and was overjoyed to see it was available on DVD.  I received it today and I am very, very, very diappointed.  It was made in Malasia by the chinese I think, and it looks terrible, like a bad quality VHS.  It was likely copied from something, and I am surprised Amazon would carry something like this.  I will be sending it back 
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 The subtitle of this book, The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa, is completely deceitful.  There is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists.  It is rather a chronicle of the Japanese film industry, not without interest in itself.  However, the voluminous facts, tid-bits of information about every minor actor, director, script-writer, and film composer, as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned, makes for increbibly tedious reading.  While the book has its merit as a source of information, not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources.  Meanwhile, reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of Kurosawa and Mifune.  The author tells us nothing about how they lived, felt, thought, behaved,what motivated them; probably because he doesn't know himself.  A simple gathering of public facts, none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available, especially on the internet, do not make for a worthy book 
 I took Passion RX because I am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion. I had great success the first week I took this product. In fact I was so pleased, I bought 2 more bottles. However, the second week, I went back to having no sex drive. And even though I am continuing to take Passion RX, it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week.  I take 2 pills each day in the morning, and have done so for over a month.  I suppose everyone is different but I won't purchase any more. Plus I just saw a webpage from Consumer Health Digest that gives it low rating compared to other products: http://consumerhealthdigest.com/top25female.htm?source=overute/Passionrx&OVRAW=passion%20rx&OVKEY=passion%20rx&OVMTC=standar 
 it's very poorly made. zipper didn't work when it arrived, and when I tried to pull it, thread was torn apart and beads fell...   cheap stuff, shouldn't have ordered it. 
 An Autobiography of Jack Gantos told under the name of Joey Pigza. While Jack Gantos sits in his jail cell he tells you the story of how he got there. Young Jack wants to be a writer, but growing up in a poor family means that he doesn't have the money to go to school. So he goes to live with his grandparents in the Virgin Islands. Shortly discovering how much Jack drinks, they kick him out. 	From there, he goes to live with a family who have an extra room and he messes that up too when he gets sick all over their house. After going through that and a ghetto hotel, he goes home to St Croix to live with his parents and work with his dad. He makes minimum wage by making and shipping crates. When a gut named Hamilton comes in with blueprints for a special crate for smuggling hash he offers jack a job. Jack sees the opportunity to get rich quick and use it to go to college, he had no second thoughts. He ends up in a medium security prison for smuggling drugs to the US. 	I really enjoyed this book because I, myself have done wrong things to do good things. I've also thought about doing things to get money quick. It's easy to make bad decisions when things are hard in life. this is an awsome book for teenagers to read and i think everybody should read this 
 While writing an easy-to-read book is certainly a gift of the author's, she is either grossly misinformed or ignorantly misinterpreting the life of Mary Baker Eddy and the healing practice of Christian Science. As a student of this Science, I found the references to it throughout the book untrue, definitely biased, and certainly unfair. Therefore, the main character's torment over whether or not she should stick with her beliefs about Christian Science and her final decision not to were not surprising nor unexpected, for with that degree of understanding (or rather, misunderstanding) of this religion's foundation and precepts, she surely made the right choice. For anyone interested in obtaining factual and accurate information about the life of Mary Baker Eddy, the discoverer and founder of Christian Science, I advise reading the following:  "Retrospection and Introspection" by Mary Baker Eddy "Mary Baker Eddy: Christian Healer" by Yvonne Cache von Feltweis and Robert Townsend Warneck "Mary Baker Eddy" by Robert Peel (3 Volumes: I. The Years of Discovery II. The Years of Trial  III. The Years of Authority "Mary Baker Eddy" Radcliffe Biography Series by Gillian Gil 
 If there is a Donald Trump in the nanny business Ms. Kline would surely be hosting the next Apprentice show except that she does not seem to have the same gravitaz that Mr. Trump demonstrates.  Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the "over achieving" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not make Ms. Kline a likeable decent person.  (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not) Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington.  She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.  The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from 
 I read this book on the strength of the author's "See no evil." Worried about a sense of deja vu, I waited five months.  That was not necessary: This book provides little sense of place or character, seeming to depend upon your having read "See no evil" for that.  If it hadn't been for "See no evil", I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  Although the first chapter was promising, I quickly lapsed into speed reading (just short of skimming).  Just over halfway thru, I became so disappointed, I stop reading.  However, my curiosity - inspired by the author's previous work - got the better of me, and I picked it back up and skimmed to the end (encountering nothing to cause me to read for enjoyment).  The book's genre is the spy version of "detective thriller" - the hero runs from place to place collecting information from various "colorful" sources, with various "old friends" providing critical information that would have otherwise disrupted the frenetic pace.  The author does not have the kind of  writing skills needed to pull off a book in this genre.  I expected (and desired) some exposition on Middle East politics, but it often came across as excessive and preachy (obsessive?).  Novels can provide a simplified version of a situation to reveal underlying truths, but this book provides only a simplistic version - readers of "See no evil" may feel insulted, not just disappointed.  I expected that part of the book would center on bureaucratic politics and infighting within the CIA and intelligence community, but what was here was disappointing, poorly set up and very badly rendered.  The ambiguities and uncertainties I would have expected were slight and peripheral to the main thread of the book.  Dialogue is often poorly rendered - it took effort to track which character was saying what - but this was a symptom of the bigger problems.  If you have this problem in an extended exchange involving only two characters, there is a problem with the characters themselves and with the plot point that the dialogue is attempting to advance.  But some of the exchanges were so trite, I didn't bother to make the effort.  Characters are minimally rendered.  The plot is slight.  Transitions between scenes are often jarring.  Too many of the situations strain credibility.  The ending made me feel not just cheated, but betrayed (appropriate behavior for a Case Officier, but not for an author).  Read "See no evil".  Skip this book - It could have just as easily been produced by a writer whose only experience was reading other books in this genre 
 I bought this table for my almost 8 month old who is starting to pull up on things.  I thought this would be safe for her to learn to stand with because it has hand grippers along the sides of the table (just for that purpose) and is recommended for ages 6 months+.  All of the fun shapes, colors, and sounds immediately caught her attention.  She cawled over to it and when she tried to pull herself up it fell over ontop of her.  She bumped her head and cried, but fortunately, wasn't hurt.  I put a rug under it thinking maybe that would help make it more stable, but as soon as she tried to pull up again (within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box) it fell over on her again.  The top of the table is very heavy, but the legs are not very sturdy, making it topheavy and easy to topple.  Needless to say, I took it back to the store.   I would not recommend this toy unless you only wanted to take the legs off and use it on the floor, or if you have a toddler who is very steady at standing on his own.  Personally, I think the recommended age should be changed for older children or this toy should be recalled and the legs redesigned. 
 As someone who enjoys remixs, generally I find the more enjoyable than the original, this is one set of albums that totally and utterly fails to deliver. It is not only amaturish, but painfully disappointing, more so since I had to pay to find that out. It is in short a total and utter waste of money and the people who produced it should be forced to appologise for delivering this rubbish to an unsuspecting public. Tracks are not remixed as much as butchered, cut, sliced, stired and stappled back together by someone who is undoubtably hearing impared. Avoid this like the plague, and if you do decide to ignore this advice then let me be the first to say .... I told you so. Utter and total botch job, and yes the same goes for the 2nd album in this collection, it actually gets worse, and trust me thats really saying something!!! 
 Overall this series is quite good.  As a former Marine, I've found that the authors do a bang-up job of recalling long-forgotten memories of service and sacrifice.  They've managed to combine snappy action and plotting with well-realized characters.  Characters (such as Charlie Bass) who's fate we deeply care about.  That being said, "A World of Hurt," the tenth and latest in the "Starfist"  series is a distinct disappointment.  After the last two books in the series, "Kingdom's Fury" and "Lazarus Rising," we had the chance to really get to know several of the main characters: Charlie Bass, Lew Conorado, Brigadier Sturgeon, Cpl. Doyle, etc.  They really came alive and of course there was the entire subplot with the supposed death and disappearance of Bass on Kingdom.    This was a major story arc, with the Marines grieving terribly at his "loss."  However, his return from the dead is barely mentioned or explored in this novel.  His promotion to officer status was similarly glossed over.  It would have been quite interesting to have seen the reaction of the Marines to his return, rather than the matter of fact acceptance of his miraculous, "Lazarus" like revival.  Or failing that, I would have enjoyed seeing the internal conflicts that Bass experienced as he assumed his new role of officer rather than enlisted man. They were hinted at in some of the throwaway lines in the book but nothing more. The Bass storyline is but one example of many that could have been fleshed out in this book.    Overall, it seems that the authors simply phoned this one in.  Especially telling is the excruciating detail with which everyday activities are described.  For Heaven's sake!  If readers have been with the Marines of the 34th FIST to this point then they don't need to read the line "fast ride on a rough road" one more time.  Ugh.  Here's hoping that the next installment serves to advance the overall story rather than serving as a placeholder 
 This book, along with the rest of the series, was a huge disappointment.  Its plot is comparable to that of a history textbook.  It simply states the facts of what is happening without the embellishment that sets a good novel apart from the rest.  Charlie, along with the rest of the characters, are flat, without fully developed personalities to bring them to life.  The story is without suspense and does not bid its reader to continue.  The main question concerning all the books is 'who is Charlie's father?' which unfortunately, is easily answered after finishing the first book of the series.  It seems that Charlie or at least one of his friends should be able to figure it out.  And a snake that turns people invisible?  What is so dangerous about that?  What are the characters risking?  Most books have some sort of threat of danger.  I was only able to get this far in the series, by clinging to the hope that Jenny Nimmo would create a twist or some suspence.  Sadly, I was proven hopelessly wrong.  How some people find these books comparable to Harry Potter, I can not comprehend.  In another author's hands this setting may have become something more unique, for it has the potential for an exciting adventure.  However, the conflicts presented in these books seem to lack importance and relevancy to Charlie's life.  Someone between the ages of 6 and 9 may find this book more compelling, but anyone past elementary school will surely find this book a waste of time and money 
 Just took ours to Goodwill - kids played with it once or twice - not nearly as fun as advertised 
 It's a good album to listen to while cleaning your apartment. Save your money. Assuming your time is valuable don't bother listening to it. It would be a complete and total waste of time. Sarah proves again that she has some powerful pipes but so what? At least "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" has "Possession" and a couple of other songs which have hooks. You get the picture that Sarah was under pressure from the record company and just cranked out some songs with no hit potential and nothing really for the concentrating listener 
 The best part of this book is the bibliography; it is clear that the author performed extensive research into the history of automatic firearms.  The breakdown of the book is pretty much as follows: 1st 1/3rd: fairly thorough if necessarily brief biographies of Samual Colt [who would normally merit no more than passing mention in any other book on automatic weapons], Richard Gatling, and Hiram Maxim. 2nd 1/2 of text: political history of the development (or rather, lack thereof) of the tactical and strategic use of machine guns by Western powers, esp. Great Britain up to and including the 1st World War [aka "The Great War,""The War to End all Wars"] - this section is the tedious part complained about by other reviewers. With reason! It is highly repetitive, is weighted with judgmental hyperbole, and overall contributed little to the value of the book. The remaining 1/6th of the text is devoted to cursory overviews of Isaac Lewis [of Lewis Gun fame], John M. Browning [perhaps the most gifted & prolific gun designer ever, if only because it seemed to have been the sole focus of his professional life], and Mikhail Kalashnikov.  The book has a few minor factual or technical errors in it, but overall is well-written and never "talks down" to the reader, but with an inadequate title; it should alternatively be titled _The Development of the Machine Gun and Its Affect upon the Great War_ or perhaps _Why the British Fear Guns, esp. Machine Guns_, especially since developments after 1920 are given such short shrift, merely touching upon a couple of the automatic arms developed during WWII, with not even mention of anything developed post-1950 (ie, nothing in the past 50 years from the 2002 copyright date!)  A sampling of some of the more interesting-sounding sources listed in the bibliography: _Airships in Peace and War_, R.P. Hearne [London, 1910] _The Amazing Hiram Maxim_, A. Hawkey [Spellmount, 2001] _The Chronic Inventor; life and works of Hiram Maxim_, J.E. Hamilton [J.E. Hamilton, 1991] __Dynamite Stories and Some Interesting Facts about Explosives_, H. Maxim [Stokes & Co, N.Y. 1916] _Gatling, a photographic remembrance_, E.F. Stephonson, Jr. [Meherrin River Press 1933] _The Gatling Gun_, Paul Wahl & Don Toppel [Arco Pub. 1965] <- (this is an excellent work, it's a crime that it's out of print!)  _Gatlings at Santiago_, John Parker [Hudson Kimberly Publ. 1898] <- (this was the personal account written by the first officer in the U.S. military to effectively utilize the machine gun/Gatling gun in battle.) _Genius in the Family_, Hiram P. Maxim [Michael Joseph 1936] <- (Percy Maxim was the nephew of Hiram, and was a prolific inventor himself, being responsible for the firearm "silencer" among other patents) _The Lewis Gun_, J.D. Truby [Paladin Press 1988] _The Machine Gun_, George M. Chinn [Bureau of Ordnance U.S. Navy 1951] _The Machine Gunner's Handbook_, J. Bostok [W.H. Smith & Sons 1916] _My Life_, Hiram Maxim [Methuen 1915] _Rapid Fire: the development of automatic cannon, machine guns and their ammunition_, Anthony G.

 I read this book several years ago.  Just recently, I read Anthony Robbin's Unlimited Power.  If you're choosing between Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited Power, definitely go with Unlimited Power.  Don't bother with this book.   
 Come on now its puffy daddy without a name change 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 This book represents itself as an academic discussion of the family in Buffy and Angel, and is dressed in the jargon of contemporary criticism, but is a largely unreadable essay of personal reflections about what the programs mean to the author. Better choices for the academic fan are Jowett's Sex and the Slayer or Wilcox' Why Buffy Matters or any of the collections of shorter pieces available in book form or on line, or, on the other hand, for the pleasure of well written personal essays with insight, Seven Seasons of Buffy. This is least successful of the growing number of Buffy studies. 
 I hate this product. Since I'm used to Office 2003 (at work), opening this program and having to look at the childish-looking menu bar was a shock. The layout is irritating, poorly designed, and does not provide sufficient features. To make things worse, this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to CD. The one-star rating was too generous. 
 i actually hate this even more then batman & robin to be totally honest. Atleast from beginning to end we all saw a camp train wreck with no plot; so it can be laughed at the for the camp classic that it is. Batman Forever masqurades as a good film but falls so far short that it earns much more of my hatred. there's just so much too hate about this film. first off lets get one thing straight...Jim Carrey is just awful as the riddler shouting and mugging through the movie. TLJ is just as bad as TwoFace laughing and screaming. Nicole Kidman is horribly miscast as bruce waynes love interest. Joel Schumacher seems to be obssesed with beauiful women then actually above average ones that are better suited for the part. the music was also horrible loud and annoying. funny enough Kilmer and O'donnel are the only actors who adds a sense of seriousness too the movie. in the end you will see a movie that had poteintial but in the end comes crashing to a big terd 
 After reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about. Very close minded and not open to any changes. At the end you will be like whatever 
 Beyoncé is a prime example of what has become of the music industry as a whole: profit over artistic integrity. One has to seriously question the timing and the genuiness of her ventures in recording in Spanish, featured in this "Deluxe Edition".   As a recent television appearance proved, Beyoncé has virtually no knowledge of the language and had to be taught phonetically to sing the Spanish lyrics. This hardly sounds like someone who has a long time  appreciation for the language.  This may be an opinion held by only a few, but these Spanish language tracks are nothing more than a business move and a shameless attempt to capitalize on the recent surge in sales of music made popular by Latino audiences. She is only fleecing this sector of the music buying public.  It would be almost a certainty that, if music popular with Russians was currently dominant on the charts, Beyoncé would be on TV expressing she has always had a love of Russian culture and "this is for all my Russian listeners!" If there should be a lull in Latin music popularity in the future, she will quickly change her tune.  As detestable as it might have been, it would have been better for Beyoncé to confess that this Spanish phase on the "Deluxe Edition" is a mere marketing ploy instead of disguising it as a sincere love for the culture. The title of her recent single may aptly describe Beyoncé at this point in time: a "Beautiful Liar" 
 This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you. My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item.  Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it. I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper) Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it. I don't think no one will die from this type of trick 
 I understand the reason why it is written in such short form, but I hated it. It was way too much. Way over the top.  It makes for such a difficult read.  The book was pretty dull anyway. Not much happens here 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 Buy this book and you will lose your maney, check it from a library and you will lose your time. The book is OK for undergraduates, but if you really want to learn anything about institutional sociology, chech out the  works of Oliver Williamson, James March, or Michael Hannan 
 I have to preface this review by saying that I am not a Caroline Myss fan.  This is not based upon my past religious upbringing, but rather on her approach to an attempted synthesis between the Jewish, Christian and Hindu teachings on metaphysics and energy systems.  In short, I think she missed the mark and tried to force fit areas together based more on her assumptions about reality than a natural meshing together of concepts.  I am educated both as a scientist and in the area of psychology, including sacred psychology across world traditions.  It was very difficult for me to even listen to the logic underlying the author's arguments.  However, by synthesizing these disparate traditions in a credible sounding manner, she has tapped into a very large market of people searching for meaning.  I am not saying that this book is completely without merit, but I would take much of it with a grain of salt.  I also think there are better books out there that are better researched, more thorough and less contaminated with a lot of the authors own assumptions about reality.  Two examples to look at while you are evaluating this book are FORGOTTEN TRUTH by Huston Smith and a BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYTHING by Ken Wilber.  There is a saying that most people would rather be entertained that educated.  I think this basically sums up my experience of this book, except I didn't find it very entertaining either.  I know that many loyal readers of Ms. Myss will disagree with me, but this is my honest opinion of her work.  
 Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner's book on the art of changing minds and affecting opinions has an appealing pull. Written by a qualified professional in the field, the book is another output of the impressive Harvard Business School Press. The book advances the view that there are seven, what it calls, "layers" or "levers" that affect a change of opinion. These factors, whose titles all begin with `re' are: -Reason -Research -Resonance -Resistances -Real World Events -Resources And Rewards and -Representational Redescriptions   Gardner subsequently proceeds to elaborate on each of the factors within contexts such as an institution, among a population, up close or as relate's to one's own mind.   So far, so good, many would say; alas the reader is compelled to add `so what?' to the phrase. Changing Minds is indeed the work of a qualified professional, but the reader is neither provided evidence nor shown the techniques and history behind the author's conclusions. Furthermore, being the work of a researcher in an academic setting, readers should not expect practical instructions or employable techniques. Rather, Changing Minds concentrates on the mechanics and psychological hypothesis. In this manner, the book is very much a scholastic paper. Finally, there is scant evidence that the author employs his own teachings. Little proof, research or reason is offered here to be convincing or allay any of the readers' resistances. Similarly dismissed is the need for charts, sub-titles, illustrations, indented or highlighted points or synopses.   Furthermore, and more ominously, the author makes several practical mistakes in the way he reads or interprets the world rendering some of his data and experiences suspect. He claims that schools are agents of change and serve to instill different opinions in youngsters. Those are his opinions and not supported by any empirical data. He does not provide any supporting data either. In fact, the contrary is true. Schools are designed to breed uniformity and teach adherence, obedience and group activity. Barely a student will pass physics class were he to challenge a prevalent theory. A law student will probably find himself choosing a new major should he differ with prescribed laws. Similarly, imagine a student disagreeing with the outcome of World War II, an astrology student disputing the form of nova stars or, at an elementary level, a high school student butting heads with his classmates and instructors. Another error is the assumption that events have lead to fundamental change even in thought process of political leaders. Let me quote from the book. While Gardner cites the example of George W Bush following September 11, 2001, many scholars and historians have shown that far from changing his mind, the US president instead leveraged the event to more resolutely drive his pre-existing agenda. Much of what transpired following the events of the day were the accelerations of the American president and his officials' overt and covert ideas and strategies. Gardner terms the new Bush, a "multilateralist"! Uncomfortably, 132 sovereign countries and a lack of support from the United Nations would disagree. Moreover, despite such fierce opposition, Bush proceeded with his plans nonetheless. Further down the pages, the author condemns Stalin's pact with Hitler as "cronyism." He conveniently forgets or omits the allies' earlier pact with Hitler or the West's subsequent treaty with the "extremely paranoid" Stalin. In short, being a tenured academic Gardner himself seems most susceptible to institutional tunnel vision and in need of constructive cognitive dissonance.   Lacking the appeal of practicality, the burden of proof or applicable relevance set in actual events Changing Minds: The Art And Science Of Changing Our Own And Other People's Minds is solely of interest to researchers in need of alternate sources on the topic.  Gardner does not provide any empirical basis for his opinions, which also deviate from the title and stated scope of the book 
 We ordered the Favorite Assortment Pack, but that is not what we received. When we questioned our order, we were told they were out of stock on our original order, and we could not return the order we received.  We won't order again 
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 If anyone deserves all 1-star averages more, its Chingy (and Fiddy and D4L).   As for this album, well, if generic beats and asinine, childish "gangsta" lyrics are your thing, then your obviusly self-induced retarded.  Anything is better than this, even a cat being strangled 
 A pointless and confusing book with a faint hearted hero who disappears without a trace before the story ends. Where did he go? We don't know nor do we care, he is nothing more than a witness to his own blubbery tale of woe, a crybaby loved only by his Mama and at times, himself. The story includes a girl he moons over from a distance,a girl he plainly has no chance with.  Repeated acts of cowardice and weakness performed by the lead character and his brother make them unlikeable but at least the brother, a moonshiner, comes off as having more grace at the end than does Muir, the narrator, who wants to be a preacher and gives up his dream of building a church, leaving it to rot into the brambles and weeds and leading to a poor girl's death. Charitable acts from neighbors go unappreciated and a sickening description of an elephant being tortured to death while Muir stands by and refuses to stop it defines his utter lack of worth. This book should not have been written and the author, who teaches at Cornell, should apologize for using the name of the wonderful John Muir for this sad sack, pitiful bible thumping creep. Oprah put his Gap Creek on her book club and Morgan has received raving reveiws and awards for that novel and other works. Why? This is all as wrong as George Bush's presidency 
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 You know, usually I am a big fan of older movies as they were typically made better and had better writing, etc. One strong exception that I just watched was "King Solomon's Mines" from 1950. What a doggy movie! It makes even the lamest Disney movie watchable. Basically, it is "Hey, look at that animal!" and then a cut to some stock footage, except in one case where a giant rubber spider creature creeped along like a relative of "The Tingler". Star Stewart Granger also seemed to understand every African language dialect except when it was really important. And, there was also an emphasis on how much ammunition was left, so the final bullets were used on certain natives to great effect. Once they got to the mine itself, it was still snoresville and basically a letdown. This was made before in 1937 and again in 1985 and in 2004 which seemingly the same results according to other reviews. Why do they keep making this same stupid movie??? 
 Some readers may be interested to know that the setting of this novel -"Sambuco" - is actually Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, until recently the home of Gore Vidal.  The movie being filmed in the village was Beat  the Devil, directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart.  (In the book Bogie is the obnoxious drunk Burnsie.)  Cass Kinsovling's household seems to be in the ground floor of the old Caruso Belvedere.  The atmosphere of this book is not unlike the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley, another tale of Americans in Italy in the 1950's.  For all of Styron's fine writing, this is something of a period piece.  The moral crisis that is at the heart of the book - the "fantastic going to pot" of  Americans in the post-war period - is not of much concern to anyone today.  Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice are Styron's masterpieces.  May he rest in peace.        
 White-washed with a heavy coat of feminist wistfull thinking, "Missing Mary" is a New Age fictional concoction at best and outright heresy at worst.  Spretnak blatantley lies when she states that Mary's presense in Catholic theology has been "played down" from the pulpit by decree of Vatican II.  Never has the church made any official statement that Marian statues were to be removed from churches and that prayer to Mary and the Rosary be given a kind of Protestant-like boot out the door.  One need only look at the papacy of John Paul II and his devotion to the Blessed Mother to see that Spretnak's assumptions are completely false.  Pope John Paul even put "M" in his coat of arms to represent Mary and he credits her with saving his life after the assassination attempt on his life.  While Spretnak was "missing Mary" in her particular church there were plenty of other churches where Marian devotions continued unabated.  Too bad she never found one, but it does not justify her shoddy research and false accusations.  Spretnak quotes theologically fuzzy Catholics like Matthew Fox and Andrew Greeley and she constantly slams Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) in the typical liberal dissendent-catholic manner.    But it's when Spretnak starts to ascribe pagan "Goddess" qualities to Mary that she goes out on a limb and saws it off.  Never in the church's history has Mary been portrayed as a goddess, a near-goddess or "the Goddess."  She is Theotokis, the "light bearer" meaning that she carried the light (Jesus Christ) in her womb.  Mary is the Mother of the Church, given to the Church by Christ as he was being crucified ("Son, behold your Mother").  She is the Ark of the New Covenant and she leads her children to Christ as any good mother does, but she is not a Goddess to be worshipped and the church has never taught that she should be worshipped, only venerated because she is the first Christian and a perfect Christian.  Mary was never GONE from the Church. She doesn't have to make a COMEBACK. Mary was never minimalized or whatever cockamaymie words Spretnak uses.   
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 It is my general policy not to write a negative review of a book. As an author, I try to support other writers and not tear them down. However, I occasionally make an exception, and Troll is one of them. I decided to write this after I committed to reviewing all the short-listed Gaylactic Spectrum Award nominees for Best Novel, and because I have yet to read or hear anything negative about this book. I think it's time another point of view is heard.  First published in Finland where it won the coveted Finlandia Prize for best novel, and then translated into English, Troll has received almost nothing but praise. The book came to me highly recommended, but I simply hated it. My first challenge was the writing. The style is simple and direct, almost too simple at times. It's also written in the present tense, an unusual choice and, for many readers, rather disconcerting. It's not an easy book to get into. The highlight for me was the alternating chapters that were "taken" from various resources on trolls. The encyclopedia and book entries were so well-written that you almost believed that trolls could be real. If only the actual story was that compelling.  I found the story itself to be extremely disturbing. The author goes out of her way early in the book to establish that Pessi is a wild animal on a par with a gorilla, and a juvenile animal at that. When the mounting sexual attraction culminates in a sex scene of sorts, I wanted to throw the book across the room and wash my eyes out with soap. In the end, the author tries to challenge your thoughts on what is culturally acceptable and warn you against making pre-judgments, but I thought the attempt was clumsy at best. Even if you assume that trolls are the equivalent of humans and therefore Angel is not into bestiality, he would still be a [...] since it was well-established that Pessi is immature, barely more than a toddler from the descriptions. Other readers have addressed none of these issues, so I can only assume that they only bothered me.   There is no doubt that this is an unusual and original book, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is good 
 Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don't need a jacket if you have this bunting. We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it.  It had a hood (that could be unzipped) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing. Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement. There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well.  The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old.  Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up! It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat, hat and mittens at a temp of 35F, but I want something that you can use without a coat.  After much research I am returning this (after a single outing) and getting a Little Kazook instead (which zips all the way up and has a hood) 
 I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it 
 I have been a Grappelli fan for years and this CD was a gift to myself.  It has been a disappointment.  When the focus is on Grappelli's violin, the CD is lives up to my expectation.  Too often, however, the music is dominated by a "jazz" organ and deteriorates to a sound reminiscent of Musak.  You will note that none of those segments are heard in the 60 second excerpts.  I was excited when I ordered the CD.  It was a surprising disappointment.  I threw away the CD 
 This book is awful.  I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it.  I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school.  The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written.  How it became a Newberry winner I will never know 
 When do the black kids take responsibility for their behavior?  How can the school help them to do this?  To be sure, it is shameful for schools to overly punish black youngsters.  At the same time, what does one say to black youngsters who devalue school or use it as an avenue to act out certain stereotypes or cultural dilemmas--when the acting out is self-destructive.  We are caught in a cycle of acting out what Richard Wright called the "Bad N*****" archetype--that is, Bad Thomas, who did not care if he was beaten or lynched, and who remained unbowed before "white" (that is, illegatimate) authority.  His heroism was in remaining unbowed.  The author would have done better by searching for the bilateral influences (cultural, stereotypical, archetypical, and developmental): that is, how being "tough" (read: a "hero" on one side, "bad," "unbowed" on the other) affects school personnel.  Having done that, she could then make recommendations about how to extract ourselves (both children and adults) from this two-way morass of two-way screwy, self-destructive behaviors and reciprocal archetypes, Bad Thomas on one side and Simon Legre on the other 
 As a 23-year Marine pilot myself, I thought Weber's work would be of special interest to me, but it was a big waste of time, forcing me to scan the last few chapters just to get it over with.  His special anti-terrorist team spend more time worrying about themselves while they break up their equipment, all the while coming up with "cutsie" conversation--and they don't accomplish a thing--but Uncle Sam pays them handsomely.  Even his side stories (which rarely affect the story line)about how terrible and scary it is to fly military aircraft are filled with supercilious thoughts by the pilots who are about to die.  In Chapter 27 (of 34), he brings in a totally new character who smashes up his plane on a carrier landing.  He lives, but is never mentioned in the book again, nor is the incident connected to the story.  Weber does, however, emulate W.E.B. Griffin in one respect--all his characters are either independently wealthy or have super-wealthy donors, so they need not worry about any expense whatever.  And they are all officers.  No mention of the grunts who make everything possible  Weber is touted as a "Marine Pilot", but no mention of what he flew, or where---???? 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 What happens when you cross Friday the 13th with "The Running man"?  The Jason strain reveals a reality show that pits death row convicts against one another until there is only one left, as an added bonus Jason is thrown into the mix to make it more interesting.  Now take this and throw in an outbreak angle(this happens when a scientist creates a designer serum and mixes it with Jasons blood creating a virus that oozes from jason and affects all of his victims and all of their victims).  Turning all of em into what jason is.....a powerful undead.  the rest of this book is a survival jaunt in the costa rican islands that has echoes of any zombie movie ever made. Survive and cut their heads off!  I thought this book was o.k., the first half of it was all character history for the dozen or more characters. Jason takes a back seat until the second half and even then he's in the passenger seat where he should have been driving.  Christa Fuast paints some really interesting background pictures for the characters, along with some snappy dialogue, although with a couple of steamy scenes laced throughout. I felt like I was reading some cheap harlequin romance books. The Jason Strain didn't feel like a true friday the 13th story.  Die hard Fans I think will be disappoited.  Bottom Line....Jason wusses out a few times in this book...Not bad and certainly not good 
 When I found out that John Legend did a cover of Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" I said to myself, "Alright. Let me hear how f***ed up this sounds. But first let me hear the original to get my mind together." So I listened to the original version by Stevie Wonder and started salsa dancing in my room. Then I listened to John Legend's remake of the song and he completely murdered the song. Let me tell you how he did it: he held it up, stabbed it with a spork, chewed it up, spit it out on the ground, stomped on it, hawkered on it, poured some bleach over it, and then set it on fire. It was a slow, painful, tortorous death and that's EXACTLY what I heard through my headphones. Awful. Absolutely awful. "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" is one of my  many favorite Stevie Wonder songs and John Legend had to ruin it.  Anyway, the soundtrack has some pretty good Old School R&B songs from EWF, The O'Jays, and The Temptations. The song "1-Thing" by Amerie sounds pretty good too. Everything else sounds so-so to straight up wack, like "Ooh Wee" and "Happy." I wouldn't add this CD to my collection at all because it basically isn't that good and John Legend made it worse. If you insist on buying this soundtrack, I suggest you walk and not run to the most distant used CD shop 
 If it were possible to give an author zero stars, I would have.  This book is seriously flawed for two reasons:  First, Ms. Shamblin has a very limited if not confused understanding of Christian doctrine.  For example, she rejects the concept of the Holy Trinity and uses many fallacious arguments to support her beliefs.  I don't feel comfortable reading anything written by a supposed Christian with this brand of faith.  Second, her main principles for losing weight include only eating when physically hungry and stopping eating when full.  The majority of people suffering from overeating don't care if they are hungry or full or not.  They eat for other reasons, including but not limited to numbing fears, dealing with resentments or to forget past relationship issues.  Compulsive Overeaters, of which I am one, will not only eat when they are not hungry, but will continue to eat far beyond feeling full -- sometimes to the point of physical pain and discomfort.  I truly believe that faith, especially Christianity, can help those suffering from overeating, because recovery from overeating requires physical, emotional and spiritual recovery.  But this book and "The Weigh Down" movement is NOT the one to help you do this.  Your best bet is to find an Overeaters Anonymous meeting in your area and start going to their meetings instead 
 This book is absolutely flawed in its arguements.  Schlesinger ignores the context of the times; he ignores basic truths; he is jaded in his outlook.  By all accts., Mr. Schlesinger is a New Deal Democrat who tries to firmly tie in the New Deal Democrats into the Democrats of old.  This is not feasible as the Democrats of old and the New Deal Democrats had differing perspectives and ideals.  He reaches and stretches with the intent of the Democrats in the Age of Jackson, that they were always for the laboring classes, when this is not the case, especially in Southern Democrats who were aristocratic in nature and outlook.  They could not comprehend the plight of the ordinary laborer, as their world view was quite skewed.  Further, divisions that were slowly emerging between Northern and Southern Democrats, primarily over the slavery issue, are discounted and Schlesinger merely goes back to his jaded perspective that the Democrats were the champions of the common people.  Schlesinger imposes his own view of politics and parties on politicians from the Age of Jackson.  There are other works out there that are 100 times better on the Age of Jackson that this work, such as The House Divides: The Age of Jackson and Lincoln, from the War of 1812 to the Civil War edited by Paul Wellman and Lewis Gannett or The Era of Good Feelings and the Age of Jackson, 1816-1841 by Robert Remini.  However, I will give the man credit where it is due, he does his research.  Pity he doesn't know what to do with it 
 Dude, Where's my car?  This is exactly what you'll be saying after you watch this one.  very bad idea 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 This insipid remake takes far too many liberties with the story, butchers its source material, and unsurprisingly ends up being quite a mess. Furthermore, the movie doesn't even really make sense when you think about it. The protagonist this time wants to travel to the past to save his love, and finds he can't alter what happened. He then goes to the future where he CAN alter events. The remake entirely forgets the point that the Eloi are supposed to be human cattle. That they're not kind of entirely destroys the whole point of the book, and the film greatly suffers as a result. The character played by Jeremy Irons was a dumb addition to the story. Ironically, the special effects used to depict the Morlocks were better in the 60s film 
 Mostly bland, by this time it seemed that BAD was dead in the water, nothing here matches the excitement of THIS IS. Especially annoying are `Sightsee MC!', `Ice Cool Killer' and `The Big V'. BAD goes rap? No thanks. It's easy to see why they did the whole BAD 2 thing. Buy THE GLOBE instead 
 I waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious, derivitive visuals especially the awful artwork but it ended up being just as bad.  I read some of the reviews and the comments are consistently favorable of the visuals even if they did not like the movie.  The only way I can understand this is by also seeing that somehow the awful art of Thomas Kinkade is so popular.  It is so marketed and fake, served to you as great art.  That is exactly how this movie has been served to you, don't accept it find something real. 
 Being an avid Simon Kenton fan, I was really looking forward to this book but found it quite boring. I suppose after reading Allan Eckert's "Frontiersman", any accounting of the life of Simon Kenton pales in comparison 
 First of all, this album mirrors Bright Eyes in so many ways, it's almost ridiculous. He sings about photographs, NBC, drinking. Bright Eyes song Old Soul Song is all about developing a photograph. Let's Not Sh** Ourselves has Conor yelling about NBC, ABC, and CBS (two of which An Angle has in Change The World) and Bright Eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs. Also, Kris has mastered the Bright Eyes singing style. This is not a negative thing, it's just very similar.   But as for the album itself, minding the bright eyes comparision, it is about 3 miles away from a masterpiece. That being said, at least it's on the road to a masterpiece, albeit far far away. Songs like True Love and A Way With Words are fantastic and shine on the album. Songs like White Horses and Green Water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else Kris has to offer. But too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking "when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk?" Songs like Born in a Bottle and Angry Drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring. Going back to Bright Eyes, the only reason that songs like The Big Picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant. Kris doesn't have this lyrical ability yet.   However, I am excited about the future of An Angle. I think in the next coming years if Kris can mature a little, both musically and lyrically, he'll make an album that's brilliant. An album like Bright Eyes' "I'm Wide Awake It's Morning" (which I believe is his best). Maybe he should just lay off the drinking. 
 I'm a big fan of Capote but unfortunately this book just doesn't do the man justice. Granted it's unfinished...but still, I was forcing myself to try and finish the book - something I have never done in his past novels. The "La Cote Basque" chapter is alright if you are into "Old Hollywood" but still Capote's sloppy writing is all too evident in this unfinished novel.  But if you want to remember Capote for his much better works, skip this titl 
 Richard II is most likely Shakespeare's dullest and most obscured play.  Of course, this is only the perspective of a sixteen year old student.  It does seem however to be a common trend among many of the readers.  This was  just one of six required summer readings for my Advance Placement  Literature course, and let me just state that under no other circumstances  would I have read this book.  And to tell you the truth, I didn't read the  book.  I purchased the audio cassette from "Amazon.com."  After  completing the tape for a second time, and only understanding a few words,  I decided to get my hands on the book itself.  The only difference that I  could notice was my ability to distinguish who was saying what.  I do not  recommend this book to anyone without a Ph. D.  Even to all of you literary  geniuses, good luck!  You will certainly need it to stay awake.  I hope I  was able to deliver a delightful and ever so typical sixteen year old's  response 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 Honestly, i think this album's not half as good as MOT.  as a matter of fact, it's worse than their 1990 release, 'step in the arena'.  it's just an okay album 
 Irving has lost his mind! This was sad to read as it just dragged on forever with no reward in sight. The taboo subjects were a little creepy but its main problem was that he wasted these developed characters on a dull, repetitive story. I think he is (was?) one of the greatest American writers alive. He must have a comeback novel next time out. If not, I think someone should check in on him 
 As the reviews below indicate, "Arthur" has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the New York Times found it a wonderful "screwball comedy" (although over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent, have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore in "Foul Play," thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought "10" and "Arthur," as it turned out a downward trajectory.  What I dislike about "Arthur" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in "The Loved One" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey.  Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes.

 It's hard to take advice seriously from a book as packed with grammatical errors as this volume 
 Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie. 1. It is incredibly beautiful animation 2. The music is amazing 3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series The Things I don't like about the movie: 1. The characters are not developed at all 2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process.  Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series 
 A few weeks ago, I happened to pick up a couple books by Ted Dekker, mainly because the plot summaries made them look interesting.  The first of these books, Three (or more properly, Thr3e), was a disappointment, but Dekker did at least show some ability with his plotting, so I decided to give my other book of his a chance.  Sadly, while Obsessed is slightly better than Three, it is still a weak effort.  The hero in Obsessed is Stephen Friedman, a realtor in 1973 Los Angeles.  Friedman - a secular Jew - is living a fast and fun life which is about to be turned upside down when he finds out his mother, who he never knew, had died.  Among the items she bequeathed to a Holocaust Museum was a Stone of David, one of five rocks that legend says David used to slay Goliath.  With the other four, the set could be worth a hundred million dollars.  The history of the stones goes back to a Polish concentration camp run by Gerhard Braun in 1944.  Braun is not only a Nazi, he is also a serial killer, a trait his son Roth has picked up as well.  In 1973, Roth comes to Los Angeles in search of the Stones and crosses paths with Friedman, who has learned a lot about his mother's history and of a girl named Esther who he seems destined to know.  Like the movie Laura, Friedman falls in love with a picture, in this case, that of Esther's mother Ruth (who he assumes Esther resembles), which will soon obsess him.  This novel has a lot of problems, principally because Dekker is not a very good writer.  For one thing, he is sloppy:  at one point he discusses Friedman worrying about streetlights at 7:30 on a summer evening, a time which would still be quite light out.  More significantly, Friedman is mentioned as being 31 years old, yet the story makes it clear he was born in 1944, making him only 28 at the beginning of the novel.  Plot points are left completely unclear, such as the fate of Friedman's friend, Sylvia.  Beyond the sloppiness, Dekker has more fundamental writing problems.  Despite the bulk of the story taking place in 1973, the reader rarely gets the sense of the time; sure, there are references to eight-track players and there are a couple stereotypical hippies, but for the most part, this could take place in 2007 with almost no noticeable effect.  And Friedman himself is a really weak character:  he's not very bright and he usually is reacting to situations instead of acting on them (actually, that's just as well, because when he tries to take action, he usually proceeds rather cluelessly).  I suppose that this can be categorized as Christian fiction (that seems to be the genre Dekker is associated with).  This has less to do with thematic material (however, religion does have something of a role in this story) than with the fact that the violence is strictly PG-13 and the romance (and language) is G-rated.  I've always had a wariness about this genre, not because of the subject matter, but because I feel that Christian fiction publishers don't focus as much on quality (although I'm sure some gems slip through) because they cynically assume they have an audience that is not as discriminating as long as the story is labeled "Christian" (the science fiction/fantasy field suffers a lot from this as well).  Unfortunately, Obsessed has done nothing to make me think any better of the genre.  If you like suspense fiction, read Michael Connelly, Lee Child, Jon Land or David Morell or a few dozen others, but avoid Dekker. 
 This novel seemed like a rush job. The characters are so prolific that you barely get to know who's who - is it human, animal or hunting history being shared. Too much to sort out and too little meat to make it worth it 
 Though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one, the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by OBs.   At one point, the author actually defends episiotomies... she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her, and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth. It was both infuriating and saddening.  If you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little, this is cute. If you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!  
 And what are those words?   Why, simply put they are:  "DENZEL WASHINGTON IS NO FRANK SINATRA"   Any questions?  No, I didn't think s 
 I agree with the reviewers who found this series "stuffy, predictable and annoying" and advised, "You might as well buy a romance novel." (Or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) What horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned Peters in the same sentence with Jane Austen and the Brontes!! Austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  In a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. The little girl asks, "Why do we have to move?" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  As outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  Austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  Peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions 
 This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him 
 A slow-moving, pretentious novel.  The main character is arrogant and unbearable.  Throughout the entire book, my feeling was who cares?  And, to the author, just tell me your message.  It could have been said in one sentence.  I don't need a boring story to get your point. 
 I bought this for my pony-obsessed daughter for Christmas, mostly because it was the only way to get the Breezie "Zipzee" (one of the main Breezies in the new movies). Thank goodness I wasn't expecting much out of this toy after reading reviews on the other playsets, because it didn't even last a day! After I assembled the "braiding" handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself, she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart. Not the handle you snap on, mind you. That was still firmly attatched. The rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it! Fortunately she gets enough use out of Zipzee and Daffidaisy that it wasn't too much of a loss that I had to throw it away only hours after opening the box.  So, unless you're really after Zipzee or Daffidaisy, don't waste your money on this junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for younger siblings. Horrible!! 
 This book, along with the rest of the series, was a huge disappointment.  Its plot is comparable to that of a history textbook.  It simply states the facts of what is happening without the embellishment that sets a good novel apart from the rest.  Charlie, along with the rest of the characters, are flat, without fully developed personalities to bring them to life.  The story is without suspense and does not bid its reader to continue.  The main question concerning all the books is 'who is Charlie's father?' which unfortunately, is easily answered after finishing the first book of the series.  It seems that Charlie or at least one of his friends should be able to figure it out.  And a snake that turns people invisible?  What is so dangerous about that?  What are the characters risking?  Most books have some sort of threat of danger.  I was only able to get this far in the series, by clinging to the hope that Jenny Nimmo would create a twist or some suspence.  Sadly, I was proven hopelessly wrong.  How some people find these books comparable to Harry Potter, I can not comprehend.  In another author's hands this setting may have become something more unique, for it has the potential for an exciting adventure.  However, the conflicts presented in these books seem to lack importance and relevancy to Charlie's life.  Someone between the ages of 6 and 9 may find this book more compelling, but anyone past elementary school will surely find this book a waste of time and money 
 I bought this book thinking it would help me to sort out issues I was having in a current relationship. Unfortunately I found the writing style tedious and hard to follow. I am sure there was a message in it but some of it seemed to be religion based and I haven't managed to pick it up long enough to finish it yet. I own my own bible and if I wanted to read scripture I would have picked that up. No doubt others found this book helpful as is evident in other reviews and I don't want to take away from what were obviously positive experiences for them. I also bought "He's Scared, She's Scared : Understanding the Hidden Fears That Sabotage Your Relationships" by Steven Carter, Julia Sokol and also available from Amazon. I switched to that halfway through and I found this to be a far more helpful book and ultimately it has helped me a lot more than the book in this review. 
 The book poses a very good question, one that most people are thinking about - "What will the future of work be in an outsourced global environment? "  But sadly Malone never risks making any futuristic predictions. This book captures the history of functional organizations and a some recent radical organizational models.    Internal trading concept for sharing scarce resources within an organization was rather interesting. In the final chapters Malone goes in-depth about the consulting industry's model of resource deployment, but he seemed to have missed out the key role that Resource Deployment Managers play in serving customers. As an earlier reviewer mentioned the concepts are over simplified and repetitive. It was an interesting read for me until I finished 2/3rd of the book, when I started to slowly discover that the book was repeating concepts and the author is reluctant to be making bold predictions as the title suggested. If you just want an interesting presentation on different organization models currently in practice then this book may be for you but if you are looking beyond the present then you will be disappointed.         
 I bought this CD already familiar with the Dance/Trance/Techno scene for years, listened to a few times and never picked it up again. I picked up this CD since it had Tilt's - I Dream (Resurection Remix) - (which is the only track that carries a captivating beat - truly awesome) thinking that the rest of the CD would be just as incredible. Unless your gonna get sloshed or shoot up on something and freak dance to strobe lights amist a booming sound system, don't waste your money on this one. Until I personally decide to do this myself, only then would I rate this a five. Sasha must have better mixes out there that I have not yet discovered, but whatever the case, this CD is a disappointment. Rather than letting this CD uselessly spin in my CD deck, I simply use it as a coaster. I know many will disagree with this review but given the fact that I gave this CD an honest shot, I not writing this as a hater. I simply have not been impressed with this one. This mix carries the same monotonous beat from start to finish. Honestly, there has to be better mixes out there by Sasha... But don't waste your ears on this one.  If you liked other CDs like: Trance Mix USA, BT - Movement In Still Life, ATB - Dj In The Mix, Crystal Method - Vegas & Community Service, any mixes by Dj Micro, Tansport by Paul Oakenfold, Dj Tiesto's In Search of Sunrise, or any Gatecrasher Mix.... This CD may not be the one for you 
 I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted.  
 My daughter got this for Christmas and it stopped working three weeks later!  For the price, I expected it to work more than 3 weeks.  Plus I have a very disappointed 6 year old who doesn't have a CD player anymore 
 I'm part way into this book, I have about 200 pages left, and I'm already confused.   For instance how is everyone in the little unheard of community of Ravenkill right up with the happenings in The Hague?  Does world wide news reach little burgs that fast.  And what was with Andrew Franconia the innkeeper that he calls the US Marshalls as soon as Maggie registers?   I don't get it, everyone seems to know what everyone else is doing faster than they can move about.   So I guess I'll have to finish the story to find all the answers if they are revealed 
 I actually developed my Palm application in Java with the Palm CDK and JUMP2.  As mentioned in earlier reviews, this book is directed to C/C++ programmers using either CodeWarrior and GCC.  I also found the information on Palm databases to be pretty shallow.  In most cases the examples were pretty shallow and certainly did not provide too much insight on how the records on the desktop are sync'ed to the handheld.  Even less was covered on how you might pull content via a web service or xml/http to the desktop.  Need an example of where this book falls short...  How do I create a .pdb file on my desktop 
 . . . but Plato would have hated this book and it's obvious marketing ploy 
 People who say victims MUST forgive may be laying an additional burden on a person who is struggling to heal by forcing them to feel something they can't, making them responsible for their abuser's rehabilitation (remember that so many victims are told to be quiet to protect their abusers), and marginalizing their suffering. Far too simplistic for a self-help book and may inspire well-meaning people to add more injury to someone who is sufferin 
 The 2001 printing of this book is full of errors.  The author's errata list is 71 pages long.  Get the 2nd printing: paperback with updated CDROM.  I'm going to be returning mine 
 No way to change the inputs on your TV. The DVD functions and the TV functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a "tv" button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to. Therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on/off, the TV or the XBox. And if things couldn't get any dumber, if you press the eject button while the remote is in TV mode it doesn't work. The eject button is only designed to work with the XBox yet it is disabled when in TV mode?  There is also no option to program a receiver.  As many others mentioned, this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk. Do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage 
  Amongst scads of positive reviews, it's a pleasure to offer a dissenting voice. What is this book?  The book's jacket sez: "this hyperkinetic and relentlessly inventive novel ... a narrative particle accelerator ... cooler than zero and unaffectedly affecting, a hilariously funny and deeply serious meditation on the nature and uses of the mind." Cooler than zero? That's called hype, and even though it reads like the shameless promotion for something hollywood, it might be the best writing to be found in this book.    The basic premise & narrative structure of "Hard-Boiled Wonderland," while not especially original or inventive, does hold potential for a meditation on the mind. But Murakami thoroughly fails to touch this space. The characters are caricatures, one-dimensional, facetiously portrayed, and defined entirely by eccentricities. They lack any real sense of an inner life (despite the premise), and are, in most cases, some variation on stock cliches (the "deranged scientist," the "undemure granddaughter," and "various thugs" (this from the book's jacket again)). The narrative itself is also beset by cliché and caricature, not "genre-bending" but derivative, a poorly realized reguritation of big-movie & mass-market conceits.   In fact the very language is often a weary assemblage of catch phrases and common combinations, sometimes laughable in their anesthetizing overuse: "I stood there dumbfounded, as if I'd been hit by a blunt object, overcome by the chilling realization of my utter helplessness" (Ch.3). This is a sense even better conveyed by reading a few pages. And although it's said to be "adroitly translated," Alfred Birnbaum appears to be trying to capture the sense of Murakami's style by casting it in a kind of hackneyed American vernacular.  The science-fiction or cyberpunk elements are watery at best; the book basically equates the mind with a kind of clever computer system that operates according to some fuzzy Freudian misunderstandings. And after living in Japan for a year, its clear that this novel has nothing insightful to offer about the culture or sensibilities of the Japanese, one of Murakami's alleged assets. (For that I recommend Abe or Mishima instead.) The Murakami book-covers are beautifully designed and blurbed with a "cooler than zero" edginess, but after reading this one, its seems clear that Murakami is largely the buzz of a successful marketing engine, rather than an innovator of language and literature. 
 I opened one of the packages and there was blood on the card that the sham was folded around. I promptly called Amazon and they replaced it. It was a waste of money, the first time I washed them, white patches appeared all over the shams as if they dye washed out. I was very, very disappointed with the quality and will not order them again. Don't waste  your money 
 You'll never get the straight story about nationalism out of Eric Hobsbawm, who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic.  David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: "he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).  Such twisted thinking is evident through "Nations and Nationalism," where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's "Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity" or Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities. 
 As a Muslim woman who covers herself, or is "veiled," we are in no need to find the truth -- we have the truth and that is Islam.   I don't know why others are so hellbent on trying to convert those who follow the fastest growing religion in the world. Maybe because the authors and Sara the dreamer, are insecure with their own faith.   Nowhere in Islam does it encourage forcing religion down someone's throat, yet in Christianity, you can't find a place without some missionary forcing food and the Bible on some child in a hungry city in Bangladesh.   It's actually quite sad when you have no faith of your own and thus prove it by using all your energy to try to change others. Why don't the authors use their energy to become better Christians and leave Muslims alone?  I work with Christians and Jews, agnostics, and atheists and I have never had a problem. No one has tried to convert me, nor have I tried to convert anyone. I show my religion by my actions and vice versa.   Many good people I know are Christians, please stop making them look bad. 
 this book is horribly wrong. Really, who wants to read about growing old and dying alone because you hated life and all the people it brought to you. This book is full of regrets and is endlessly tormenting to the reader that your every mistake will kill you in the end and that self-independance is a killer. They make you read this book in high school now and everyone in the free world with the right to education knows that a book they have to MAKE you read is not one that most people would WANT to read. Too bad you cannot make it no stars 
 How can so many people rate this movie a high star?!?   It overused the same ghostly scenes from the Grudge and it was extremly predictable. You already know how it will end when you watch the first twenty minutes of it.   I mean, it showed the same house that was "burned down" in part one, and had the same effect as it: people visit the house, then they are cursed. Nothing can beat the original. nothing. You are wasting your time with this movie, seriously.   If you did not think this was a bad movie then answer this one question: why was that man eating breakfast at the table killed, along with the others when they never visited the house AND (mind you) they were in CHICAGO, not JAPAN?!?!?!?! wow, do NOT rent this junk. 
 Nice looking toaster, makes good toast, but one MAJOR problem that I've had.  When making toast, especially when only making one slice, the slice pops right out of the toaster. If I'm not there to catch it, (like that old "I Love Lucy" episode where Lucy always catches the toast from the toaster, when making Ricky breakfast), I end up picking my toast up from the counter, or sometimes the floor.  Unfortunately there's no way to correct this without having to go through the hassle of having it repaired, so I guess I'm stuck with this "projectile toaster".  By the way President Bush, I think I might have found one of those "weapons of mass destruction" 
 I don't know why so many parents recommended this series. The title character is little brat that use words like "dumb", "hate", and "fat". She has very poor grammar. I think it is supposed to be funny, but I just found her to be annoying and selfish.  I am so sorry that I ever bought these 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 I was absolutely bored to tears while reading this book.  I think that a lot of the suggestions towards better leadership are very well intentioned and are good ideas, but it is very heavy in religion.  If you are a strong believer in JC then this book might appeal to you.  I was sick of the many religious references by page 30.  The story was also poorly written.  I found myself having to re-read portions of the book to understand the point.  The only thing I will remember from this book is EGO (you'll get it once you've read it) 
 Like the Donny & Marie and Donny companion compilations, this cd sounds just dreadful.  Like so many other recent reissues, the person doing the remastering tried to make these recordings sound as "modern" as possible, meaning that they have eliminated what little dynamic range was present to begin with on these recordings and also set the EQ so that the tonal balance is on the extremely bright side.  Donny's voice, for example, is thin and harsh sounding.  This is the worst sounding Osmonds collection I've heard, and I have everything Curb has issued on cd.  Avoid this one at all costs 
 I bought the Hardcover Boxed edition published October, 1988, by Houghton Mifflin Co (Trd); ISBN: 0395489326 -- and I have to say that this edition is a disgrace.  The books are hardcovered with brown cloth and are protected by a tannish yellow cover, each with different artwork by Alan Lee.    This edition is horrible because the ink and printing is NOT really well-done.  There are hard-to-read words, smears, blotches, etc.  The paper quality is grain and has a tint of yellow in it - not recommended for white-white paper book readers.  Each book has a "Middle-Earth" foldout map at the end of the book.  These maps are terribly glued on to the back flap and are stuck close to the binding.  If you try to take the maps out, which is intended to be taken out to hang on the wall, the brown flap paper will stick and tear along with the folded map.  J.R.R. Tolkein's trilogy of the Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece, but keeping a set that I will read over and over needs to be well-made. I do not recommend this 1988 edition because of the quality that Houghtin Mifflin printed and bounded.  The artwork covers are beautifully done and well-designed.  Everything else is fair game 
 I wrote an initial review that praised these headpohones, but after a recent breakdown, I had to readjust my rating from 4 to 1 star.  Below is my initial review followed by the update:   I can't really say whether these reviews are accurate or not because I've only had my pair for 9 days (they were a Valentine's Day gift). I can say this much: so far, so good.   The Cons:   Like others have stated already, the sound is good, but not great and they don't get very loud (the bass is virtually nonexistant too). The coord is long, but it's also incredibly flimsy for a set that's supposed to be high quality.   The Pros:   I gave these a 4 star rating simply because, so far, they're durable, they're affordable, and (despite what I've read) quite comfortable -- in my opinion. I've spent hours and hours spinning records with these on and I haven't had any discomfort (I should mention that I have small ears). Despite the heavy mileage I've already put on them, again, I may not be the best judge because I've only had them for 9 days. The package also contains a few cool skullcandy stickers, an adapter for stereos/mixers and the like, a nice looking travel bag that has room for more than just the headphones, and a pair of black ear cushions if you don't like the camo.   My personal opinion as a DJ:   While these aren't the worst headphones out there, you should probably go for something better if you have the cash. I swear by the Senheisser brand, but those and other high end brands can get a little expensive depending on the quality level you want. I think Skullcandy spent more time on the cosmetic aspect instead of focusing on performance, but I'd easily recommend these to beginners or those that want a more affordable, above average set of headphones.   We'll see if I can say that they're durable 6 months from now though. I'll update this review if they turn out to be crappy, but so far they aren't.     Update: March 12, 2007 Like most of these reviews have stated, these things don't last. I went to turn my set on and they just gave out on me -- I haven't had them for more than a month (it'll be a month on the 14th). I haven't dropped them or yanked the cord or anything of that nature, yet my headphones have failed on me. For that very reason, I reduce my rating from 4 to 1 star. These things are terrible 
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 Kasun has written what I can only characterize as a completely biased, unabashed distortion of scientific reality, evidently from the perspective of someone who regards living six to a bed as normal, and to whom the welfare of our Mother Earth and all species are utterly inconsequential 
 Rule number one if you're making a Stephen King movie, especially if it's a TV movie; make it scary or don't make it at all!  THE TOMMYKNOCKERS fails to do this miserably!  For most of the film, you're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions.  Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it.  There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late.  You've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an X-FILES episode.  On the plus side, I had no problem watching the infamous Traci Lords act like like a total slut!  Bless her 
 Bought this from amazon.  Worked well for compact flash cards.  Always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card (from kodak camera).  so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera.  And all of a sudden, it died on me.  Had to throw it out 
 I took my niece skating last night with these skates.  They were forever coming unstrapped - and actually fell off her foot once.  They look nice - but not safe at all 
 The item arrived to us the week of Christmas three weeks after we had ordered it.  It arrived with several broken and several missing parts.  Amazon would not send us new parts, they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first.  This was to be a Christmas gift to my son, so that was not optional.  Had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would I would have had time to return it 
 This book was worthless to me and would be to anyone other than a Yoga instructor.  I have been doing Yoga for a year and was looking for a book that displayed a wider range of "exercises" with descriptions of each.  While this book does in fact show 608 poses, it does not provide any instruction on positioning.  I use Yoga to complement my weight lifting and long distance running and this book does not do this.  Having said this, a professional Yoga instructor probably would know exactly how to do each pose and just having a visual representation may be quite helpful.  I highly recommend "Journey into Power, How to shape your body, free your self, and transform your life" by Baron Baptiste.  Don't be scared by the esoteric nature of the title, for me it was very thorough on the exercise part of Yoga.  I don't know why these people insist on attempting to inculcate this psycho-babble on people that may just be looking for exercise and the benefits of the relaxation.  No offense intended 
 After finishing the 70-290 book in the set and taking the exam, I am shocked at how "out of touch" this book is with the actual exam.  Topics that were barely touched upon in the book ended up being huge sections in the test and vice versa.  I started buying Sybex cert books because of how well the CCNA book was done and how it actually related to the exam.  I'm hoping the other books in this kit are a little more up to par 
 Were it not for Eminem's diatribes of the hood and a handful of curious Detroiter's (former and current), I can't imagine what interest this book would hold for anyone.  I know the area Clemens speaks of and it is nothing short of amazing that he has so little to write about that is interesting.  I suspect that the author was an "academic-in-waiting" from his earliest years and that the sounds and heat of the street were a little too dangerous for his sensitive soul.  I will give him credit for being a decent writer, though.  Furthermore, claims by a number of reviewers that Mr. Clemens is racist are pure politically correct nonsense.  It is more likely the case that the author is guilty of being white and a bit naive 
 This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon.  Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks.  Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype.  Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier. 
 My husband bought me this camera for my birthday in May 2006.  I loved this camera.  Well, it stopped working on Christmas Eve.  I used it that morning with no problems, put it on the charger to recharge for later that evening.  When I removed the camera that evening, the screen remained black.  It would not take any pictures. After talking with the customer service folks, I sent my camera in for repair.  It was under warranty, and I had not done anything to break the camera.  Well, they voided my warranty stating that it was "Impact Damage" and my repair bill was $111.00.  You have got to be kidding.  I called to question the voided warranty since I had not dropped the camera.  The technician I spoke to explained that "Impact Damage" could happen if the camera bumped up to something in your purse.  So I asked to speak to a manager. I am sorry, but if I am going to spend this much money on a camera, I expect a little better quality.  I have called and email the Kodak Company several times to have someone talk to me.  Nobody has bothered to return either my calls or emails. I would SERIOUSLY think twice before spending money on a camera that can break by no fault of your own only to have the warranty voided and billed an amount comparable to a brand new camera.  I have discovered that the quality of a product is only as good as the company that will stand behind it. 
   	  Like a few others, I'm commenting on your comments. WHY does ANN COULTER produce a LUKEWARM response by you all? Many reviews are approved )or disapproved) by a slim margin -- one third to one half. Hardly ANY reviews of her books (i've looked at others)are either universally liked or disliked. What gives? NOTE i've skimmed two of her books, because I'm so soft headed that I actually think I can learn from my opponents. I give her two stars for chutzpah. (Somebody explain to her what chutzpah is.) In constrast, read the amazon.com reviews of Frank Rich's "The Greatest Story ever Sold," which seems to make the usual liberal attempt to be fair and somewhat respectful of his opponents. Most of the reviews of his book are overwhelmingly approved or disapproved by 5 to 1 or 10 to 1. Ann Coulter produces lukewarm responses. Frank Rich provokes fervid love or hate. Can somebody explain this for me?????? 
 This is just a PR piece for the Disney company, a way to build hype so more people will buy their products and see their shows.  I was hoping for some nuts & bolts advice on designing theme parks and theme park rides.  Everybody knows how to brainstorm;  everybody knows the importance of color and lighting and music;  everybody models on computers before they make physical models.  What do Imagineers do that's different?  Do they have special techniques for brainstorming, or for choosing colors, or stage lighting?  The answers are not here.  Also, what have Imagineers learned from their mistakes?  If you take this book at face value, Imagineers have never made mistakes;  everything they've done is perfect, and any criticism leveled at Walt Disney world was later retracted or countered 
 Didn't care for it. Contained soft pornography. The wheelchair bound adolescent kid looking thru a rather obvious hole in a wall, peering at his aunt in the next room having sex with her customers. Didn't have anything to do with anything. I was counting on a more original remake, I guess. I should have known better. I didn't pay attention to the rating. My fault. They put pornography in just about everything nowadays. Cars are cars, and pornography is pornography. I wanted to watch a JD car flick 
 I bought this book in hopes it would be as good as the chicken soup books, it wasn't!   This book gave 2nd grade advice on relationships.  It was a waste of money. Stick with the chicken soup for the soul books, if you want  stories and not the advice of the author 
 Why would a publisher ever agree to publish a book 40 years after other authors have published the same material? This book, 40 years after other writers on the subject, contains no new information, adds nothing to the history of historical events, and discloses nothing that hasn't already been known or already described in the same detail in other books! Save your time and read something else 
 I read this book a few years ago, along with another one by the same author, Care of The Soul.  I found his books informative, though difficult to read because of the writing style.  Since, I have read many other books that address the same issues in a much "simpler form."  I noticed that the price for used books is very low, this should tell you most of what you need to know 
 This book was clearly written for profit. Many sections of the book are only weakly connected back to the main theme and nowhere does Helen Thomas make her case-in-chief directly. Instead, the reader is treated to a series of vignettes which all too frequently bear only a tenuous relationship to one another and which make no effort to maintain continuity. While each chapter has a reasonably strong cohesion (though those boundaries frequently intersect in a way which would make any Venn diagram lover proud), they work together not as a fine Swiss watch, but instead more like a Rube Goldberg machine. 	There is one theme which appears time-and-again: the idea that an objective and vigorous free press is a necessary part of democracy. This point is made consistently throughout the book from a cornucopia of different, albeit predicable, angles, and is artfully shown both implicitly and explicitly through excellent and enjoyable anecdotes accumulated during the author's sixty years as a White House correspondent. Unfortunately for the reader, her anecdotes frequently seem to be included for their value as self-platitudes rather than for intrinsic value or thematic attenuation. Also unfortunate is the inconvenient truth that Helen Thomas is no longer the type of reporter she praises, but the type she opines against: an opinion columnist. 	There are certainly gems in the rough scattered throughout the 201 pages, but the author's tendency both to ramble and babble makes them difficult to find and detracts from their value. With regard to Thomas' periodic attempts a historical organization, her comments at the conclusion of chapter four are revealing: "There were other press secretaries and other spokespersons. I have mentioned only a few who stand out in my mind, for better or worse." Indeed, it seems she deemed fit to simply write down a train of thought as it occurred to her in the shower; that is to say, while not devoid of organization, the linking up of subjects is tenuous at best. Perhaps the most interesting and enjoyable aspect of Helen Thomas' writing style in this book is her robust use of vocabulary, which includes a scattering of excellent words on every page (some of which I even had to look up) 
 My baby slid both down and off the side of this.  I thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated, but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base, rather it acted as a swivel and I found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner.  I am involved in a SIDS research study and this product alarms me!  She could have suffocated!  I am trying to contact the company to report this item...please do not buy 
 This book is just plain stupid. If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be estatic. However, it is not healthy. Each of our meals should be balanced. These people are promoting unbalanced eating. The reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs! If one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups, including complex carbs in small amounts, we would not only lose weight in a safe manner, but we would heal our bodies from the inside out. This diet won't heal us, it is a fad. If anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism, lose weight and even heal disease, try reading "The Schwarzbein Principle" by Diana Schwarzbein, MD. That is a great book on how to heal diabetes, hypoglycemia, and many other things. It also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight, but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place. This book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss, not getting healthy. 
 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 I ordered the book expecting the breakthrough system advertised on the cover.  Instead, the book is about going to networking events to meet people to trade referrals with.  I guess that's ok if that's your thing but it's not mine, it sure never got me anywhere, heck, the top sales guys I know won't even bother with those events.  The first 100 pages are spent just trying to convince you that referral selling is the only way to sell.  Ok so cold calling is out but I don't think referral selling is the only option.  I might have given the book a better rating if the cover told the truth and I knew I was buying a book about going out to networking mixers. Referral selling is old news and there are plenty of other books about it.  I feel let down by what I got.  And you know what?  The book isn't half bad if going to networking events is your thing.  That's why I gave it better than one star.  But why not tell people what they're getting up front?  The author needs to study up on relationship selling because you sure don't build good relationships by promising one thing and delivering another.  And why are all the 5-star reviews from people in her area in CA 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 Dick Staub makes some very good points and conections to the training of a Jedi in the ways of the Force in Star Wars and the walk of a Christian following God in life today.  However, he does misquote and misinterpret many quotes from the Star Wars movies, and I even found a misquotation from the Bible.  He makes good points, but these details were distracting to me as I read.   I am not yet finished and will leave more once I am done.  After finishing this book it occured to me that Dick Staub needs to take some time to do a couple of things. First he needs to re-read the Bible and get facts correct (He quoted Moses as saying something to Joshua, but Moses was dead at the time and God told it to Joshua). Second, he needs a simple commentary for the passages he misinterprets (He says David had Uriah killed to be the only one Bathsheba loved, He had Uriah killed to cover up his sin). Third he needs to re-watch the Star Wars movies and not bend the quotes of the characters to fit his book (He talks about Obi-Wan asking Yoda for help in Episode II and portrays the event differently than it happens, as well as bends Yoda's reaction to fit what he is trying to show). This book is not what I thought it was, and any Christian who is young in their walk should not read this. 
 I bought this LEGO toy because we've had several MegaBlocks sets and they fall apart over and over again as you build them.  I hoped LEGOs would be better, but they're not.  When built, the fortress stands only 12 inches by 12 inches, so the scale is small and you can't really play with it, given the fact that one wrong move sends the whole thing crumbling.  My son is 7 and an experienced LEGO user, but even he said, "Oh, man!  This is as bad as MegaBlocks."  This is going to end up in our LEGO box as spare parts, which is sad considering we paid $39.99 for it.   
 Bought this because the game manual was useless. There is so much NOT covered in either the manual or this guide that you are going to have to work the fan sites to find out how to work the finer points of the game.  Leave this guide on the shelf 
 I had this card for more than 6 months, and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510. Transfers went well too. Then all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting "card error" on my computer and digital camera a week ago. My SD/USB converter couldn't find the card either. I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good. What a joke 
 Having spent a couple years now as a venture investor, I was looking for a book I could point entrepreneurs to, so they could get a better perspective on the venture investment process: what do they need to have in place, what's most important, how does the process work, etc. "Inside Secrets to Venture Capital" would take someone maybe 75% of the way there. Unfortunately, that's not good enough, as the lack of that last 25% would likely mean that the reader would head off in some unproductive directions. So I can't recommend this book to entrepreneurs I counsel, or to anyone else 
 I wanted to like this book.  I wanted to learn something about the modern rise of anti-semitism.  Sometimes, you just don't get what you want.  I read the book, hoping to answer some serious questions: Is anti-Zionism the same as anti-semitism ?  Are Jewish anti-Zionists experiencing self-hate ?  Is the rise of European anti-semitism a product of long lasting traditions or a by-product of Muslim immigration ?  I still have these questions.  The book does attempt to address these issues.  It does so by a selectively culling statements, events, and quotes.  Where a book of this nature would demand 100's of pages, the author here feels that his cobbled collection of editorials can address these issues with limited research and less than 200 pages.  It is tragic that such a serious topic is handled, so casually.  Like many people, I fear a second Holocaust prompted by Iranian nuclear ambitions.  What does Schoenfeld think of this issue ?  He agrees that such a threat exists, but sees fit to address it in only one paragraph.  What about a solution to the rise of anti-semitism ?  The only one I can find, is the belief that a stable democratic Iraq will reduce the phenomena.  I don't want to get too political here, but that's a pretty disquieting source of optimism.  There is something here, but there's not quite enough.  I don't disagree with the author, but I don't feel that throwing out a collection of individual opinions constitutes a serious analysis of a serious topic. 
 Disappointing.  Many pictures are dark and/or fuzzy.  I find that hard to distinguish features of different hawks 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 Orhan Pamuk's main character reads a book and his whole life changes. My life, unfortunately, was not changed after reading his book. It is far too abstract.  This fluently written search for the sense of life and the unified reality of the world ends in banalities: `What is life? A period of time. What is time? An accident. What is an accident? A life. The accidents in this book (e.g. a car accident, a mysterious killing by the agents of the CIA and Coca-Cola), the mysterious characters (e.g. Angel(s) `who were unable to divine the mystery in the creation of the viceroy called man') should create a `thriller' atmosphere, but they seem to be more inspired by the readings of `The Principles of Mysticism' or `Annotated Dream Interpretations'.  The main character states that `A good book is something that reminds us of the whole world.' One asks oneself when reading this novel if there is nothing more important on our planet than illusory meetings, killings, loves and travels. This book is a perfect flight from reality. A huge disappointment. 
 Yes, actually I do. To warn potential readers from reading the most crappy book in the face of the Earth. Gerald betraying his adored Ellen? Mammy betraying her most loved mistress? Ashley being gay? (Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?) Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie) Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?  It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.  Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.  If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature 
 Despite what the book title "Grammatically Correct", this book is mostly about punctuation usages.  Grammar is limited to a thin, single chapter.  There are not sufficient materials on grammar to alert you on incorrect usages, let alone correct them.  I would recommend "Painless Grammar" over this title 
     I want to be fair, because there is material of value in this book.  The problem is that it takes so much energy to seperate it from all the anti-psychiatry dogma, endless references to philosophers, abusively harsh judgements of people who are living in great pain, that, in the end, I don't think it is really worth the effort to read.  An editor should have stripped away all the caustic negativity, rants and raves, and slimmed the volume down to about 100 pages or less.     With all due respect to the author, because I have bipolar disorder myself, I question whether she really has her illness under control.  Waking up each morning in a state of utter despair does not sound to me like someone has found satisfactory treatment.        It also bothers me that it is implied that mentally ill people simply don't use their will enough to better themselves.  While this may often be true, it is also often true that these people are exerting truly heroic willpower each day simply to stay alive.  To call them "wimps" really does not help anyone.      While her descriptions of severe depression are more or less convincing, her descriptions of mania are a walk in the park compared to what I have experienced and what many people I know have experienced.  Someone who is in a state of acute psychosis will not be helped much by repeating a prase such as "green frog."  I also question the assertion that the mind can only think one thought at a time.  If you beleive this, then you do not understand psychosis.     Thomas Szazs, and others that call mental illness an unreality...they are taking an armchair approach to psychiatry.  As when watching a football game, it is very easy to criticise from afar when you are not the one getting your bones broken by 300 lb defensive players.  Anyone who has first hand experience with severe mental illness knows that it is all too real.  The cause is irrelevant.  The fact is people suffer, people die, often unecessarily.  Being insensitive to their suffering only makes the problem worse.  Judging a person who takes medication, when you don't understant their life...is just ignorance.      Thomas Szazs calls mental illness a "metaphorical illness"...which makes him a metaphorical psychiatrist, since he did not actually treat any patients.  He was primarily a "philosopher," who really wasn't interested in working directly with the mentally ill patients.     If my review seems to be rambling, ranting and raving, then don't read this book...it is even worse.  I think the author is coming out with a second book, and it will be interesting to see if she makes any changes.      
 Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution contained far more relevant information than The Atkins Essentials.  Frankly put, if you already have one of the Atkins books, don't waste your money and buy more.  All you need is one 
 My daughter received this as gift from her Aunt(an Eloise fan) for her 6th birthday.  I found it to be confusing.  I would not pick this for a child. Not my idea of a childrens book 
 This book was not very enjoyable even though I tried to like it. I am  interested in Nazism as well as the occult, so I thought this would be a  no-brainer purchase. Wrong. The information within the book is boring and  tedious. The author informs us of various "mystics" who may or  may not have had influence on basic Nazi ideology, but he fails to delve  deep into the actual description of these beliefs and their correlation to  National Socialist policy. The book could have been something if concrete  examples of these ideologies were given (e.g. excerpts from Ostara) 
 Pure pulp fiction. Appeals to the paranoiac and hate filled conspiracy minded (I use that word loosely) among us. The fact is two or more people cannot keep a secret, so if more than one person knows, it isn't a secret. How some can think so little of their fellow man, is beyond me 
 This unit will not fit all lighter sockets.  I've been unable to get the unit to work at all in my wife's Saab 9-3.  The 33185 version does fit 
 This is an excellent film, which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor.  I was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor, inter-titles appear to be missing, and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don't match the action on-screen.  It's a shame, because a film like this one deserves much better 
 That's what it is...It's a book that takes a few key concepts and embellished it to reasonable thickness so as to hit the stores looking good.  I finished it in 1 1/2 days - skipping many mundane references.  In my opinion, the book is probably worth less than 20 pages of useful material 
 After reading the previous reviews and before ordering I thought this might be of value,Wrong,I am not sure how anyone besides vested interests could reccomend this book.If you have no desire to succeed in marketing then this is your book. I recall the old saying "Those that can't, teach" if you follow any of the guidelines here be perpared to waste a good year of your life and alot of money,this is obviously a plug for the copy writers union,if they have one. Do an online search on marketing adcopy or whitepapers the free info you get will be of far more value 
 This movie was awful. The main reason was, it is just too unrealistic. You have "angels" played by people like scatman crothers and Charles Durning as well as the Devil played by the now later Oliver Reed coiming into the middle of the scenes and "fast forwarding" and "freezing".......just not realistic at all. Plus you have travolta as an inventor. Edible sunglasses? Yes I know not all movies have to be 100% realistic but this movie just goes too far. I watched it because Grease was such a great movie but this movie just is pathetic, even compared to an average movie, let alone Grease.  On the bright side however, the theme song "twist of fate" is one of the best songs of all time and the video is equally awesome. I think I may have just bought the movie to hear the theme song 
 I was very pleased to finally acquire this book, having heard of it several years ago. Although I'm not an expert in history, I have read a lot of books concerning this period, and always look forward to reading more. My pleasure soon turned to dismay as I started reading. Through the first few chapters I had a growing but unspecific feeling of unease - something about the prose didn't ring true. It was nothing I could put my finger on; aspects of the writing didn't feel authentic.  I persevered. Eventually I stumbled across details that I knew were wrong. For instance, in this period the term "Your Majesty" to address the King or Queen had not yet been introduced. This didn't come about until the time of the Tudors. Plantagenet monarchs were content to be addressed as "Your Grace". Next, Edward IV was several times described as wearing a collar of interlinked S's. Unlikely. Yorkist collars tended to consist of roses and suns - the interlinked S collars were favoured by the Lancastrian nobility. Then in book 2 of the series we were asked to believe there was a Jewish money-lender in Whitby. As this story is set slap bang in the middle of the three hundred and fifty year period during which all Jews were banned from England, I find this hard to believe. Book 3 (which I've read, living as I do outside the US) would have us believe a crescent moon sailed the sky for an entire night. I ask "On which planet?!" A crescent moon when new is seen only at the start of the night, and when waning is only seen in the hours before dawn. The only moon that is seen all night is a full moon.  These known inaccuracies ruined the book for me. I found myself questioning every detail I read. Was it true? Was it authentic? Or was it just a flight of fancy or wishful thinking on behalf of the author? In the end I was unable to finish the 3rd book in the series because I found myself irritated to the point that I no longer cared about the fates of the characters. I'm only grateful that I got the books out of the library rather than spending hard earned cash on them.   I'm left wondering how such glaring errors could make their way into a published book...or am I expecting too much that a work of historical fiction should reflect its setting accurately 
 I agree with the comment earlier that there is no why in the end.  Every reader wants to know why he committed such a heinous act.  If it is greed, greed is too simple for this book because everybody is greedy in one way or another.  Please, next time Grafton, let us in on the reason for a person's demise, especially if you have the audacity to take us back 30 years.  
 The fiestaware is nice of course, but the item was not packed as well as the other 7 sets I recieved and as a result, was broken.  Amazon was quick to replace it, but it was still an unfortunate situation 
 You might not like  this book.The best part of this story is when he finds a cat in the trashcan.And he all ways wanted a dog.And I did not like the book becuse it got boring when you just read it all the time.But you might like it.But it was kind of good 
 Fact- there are a lot of bad movies. Another fact- most of them came out last year, and many came out this year. In fact, 2005's shaping up to be 2004 all over again. 5 Children and It proves this, and makes me cringe for the future of movie making if this is what passes as a family movie these days. Not since A Wrinkle in Time, quite possibly the single worst movie ever made (even worse than Elektra, Overdrawn at the Memory Bank, Van Helsing, and The Day After Tomorrow), have I been so disgusted at movies making as a process. 5 Children and It further proves that all you need to make a movie is a half-assed plot, some valuable lesson, and a quirky creature. Even worse, it features Freddie Highmore, the most annoying child actor since Haley Joel Osment. I swear to god, this kid signed a pact with the devil in order to become famous. He was annoying in Finding Neverland, a total darsh in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and even worse here. Why was this kid even hired? He looks like the human incarnate of Stewart Little, and apparently, all it takes to make him poor-looking, is giving him old clothes. Giving Anthony Hopkins ratty clothes in Hearts in Atlantis didn't make him look like trash, and it's not working here. The kid still looks like a snobby, richie-rich brat. But that's just one of many problems with 5 Children and It. I'll get to the point, and say that this movie is a must-have for abusive parents. In fact, I may just buy this movie to use as discipline for when I have kids in the future, and they do something stupid like kill someone, or sleep with Louie Anderson. Also, I pity Eddie Izzard if this is what his movie career has come down to.  I haven't read the book this is based on, and have no intention of doing so after seeing this atrocity. The movie starts out with 5 children (duh huh porridge) leaving their parents at a train station. It's taking place during either World War, and so their father goes off to fight, and the mom...I don't know, leaves to discover her inner goddess or something. The kids are sent off to distant relatives, one of which looks an awful lot like a certain character in A Series of Unfortunate Events. The uncle is obsessed with math, the aunt is off in her own world, and their son is asexual. He sports a mullet while at the same time looking like Benjamin Franklin. While wandering around the house, the children discover a door in the attic that leads to a beach. This is almost a Narnia rip-off. When they waltz around the beach, they dig up a big shell. Inside the shell, is Eddie Izzard trapped inside a CG creature named It. Poor guy. Eddie brings this character to life with a disinterested tone of voice, and doing his best impersonation of Pepe the prawn of Muppets fame. It turns out that this guy can grant a wish each day. Since the children's' relatives gave them tons of chores to tend to, they wish for these to get done. It grants the wish, and the children go back home. Well, It granted their wish, but not in the way they expected. It made clones of the children to do the chores. And of course, they make more trouble than good. In Fantasia fashion, they break dishes and screw things up. There's another catch- any wish It grants, fades away at sundown. So all the clones fade away by evening, and everything's back to normal. This happens a few more times with the wishes before the little Benjamin Franklin look alike gets suspicious, and catches on.  There are a number of problems with the movie. First is in the casting of the 5 children. Freddie Highmore plays a total whiney idiot who constantly complains about how the wishes are greedy, only to make greedy wishes himself. At one point, he makes a wish to fly away and see his dad, in which It grants him magic CG angel wings that have the power to move at 8 frames a second from MS Paint technology. But because the kid's an idiot, he spends too much time flying around, and the wish fades away before he can really do anything. The other children are just around to give Freddie someone to talk to. The oldest boy is the typical older, stronger character who somehow knows more than everyone, despite having about the same knowledge of their situation, the two girls are nearly identical in unimportance-ness, and there's a baby boy who vanishes every few scenes. When the kids venture into the city, the baby's kinda left in the streets to do his own thing, and the next thing we know, he's being carried around. I'd then wonder where the hell he even was before that, since no one was carrying him. And how about those wishes that the kids make, or how many it takes before they want to see their parents? Wishing for stupid gold to buy new dishes that their clones broke (of which they never do, and the relatives never notice) is bad enough, so why don't they wish for something half-decent? And poor Eddie Izzard. He really sounds like he doesn't want to be there. Never once does he seem happy or anything close to interested in his role. Maybe because he's a CG monster with back-in-1998-graphics for most of the movie, and then a puppet for the last segments. Or maybe he's just plain drunk. It is funny how all the good CG went into It, and everything else got the short end of the stick though. And finally, the ending and its message? Any parent, even a Jenny Jones guest one, could do better. If your kids are still watching the movie by this point, I can promise you that they will hate morals from that point on.  The visual quality of the disc is pretty poor. LOTS of grain and artifacting, as well as some compression issues. The worst parts are when CG is used, like when the children walk down a staircase and several clones of little Ms. Freddie Highmore are on the staircase as well, cleaning. All of them look blurry, almost like the production team was using a blue screen for the fist time. As for the audio, it's all center focused, and get this- has some static when a character screams loud. How could something like this even get put into a final product?  Special features? Apparently, the production team never heard of those either. All we get are subtitles in English, French and Spanish. That's all. Not even a trailer is included. Not that I'm surprised. I doubt the director and cast would've done a commentary for such a horrible movie. But you'd think there'd be even a 5 minute making of featurette included. No such luck. The disc's a flipper- one side's widescreen, the other's in full.  Simply put, if your children have already been punished with A Wrinkle in Time, this is going to be the final nail in the coffin. I honest to god don't know why this was even made aside from reminding us that Freddie Highmore is in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. God, just look at the box- it even mentions that movie on the cover. That's probably the lone selling point of the movie. Stay away from it like Gary Busey's teeth 
 This was one of the few books on Japanese history available in my local library, so I read it second (the first was "Embracing Defeat," a history of the post-WWII Occupation) in trying to learn more about Japan.  Unfortunately, on the one subject I do know in detail, Pearl Harbor (any and all books by Gordon Prange are excellent) the authors were just plain wrong. The errors were all in one direction, too -- dismissing the dull facts in favor of kewl conspiracy theories. I couldn't find out where they got their errors, either, since the attributions both in the text and in footnotes were vague to the point of uselessness.  The result is that I've soaked in a gripping political thriller whose background I _know_ is distorted by an unknown amount in the direction of conspiracies -- and there's a lot of conspiring in this book. I'm not optimistic about how many of the other conspiracies are made up, too, and it's going to take me a lot of research in better books to come to an intelligent conclusion. Thanks so much. Very few books leave the reader feeling dumber than he started out 
 I've already alluded to these terrible performances in my review of his even more outrageously anemic performance in his Rachmaninov disc.  I don't know what to say.  What passionate fan of the piano oeuvre doesn't know The Tchaikovsy 1st (this review will focus on this since I really do not care for the Mendelssohn)? Having heard the Tchaikovsky hundreds of times, not always by choice, I regretfully admit that I know this piece like the back of my hand, every single note and chord.  How on earth can Lang Lang justify this pseudo-intellectual, pedantic, "I'm on valium" account?  This is a show piece, meant to be played to elicit excitement.  Pay attention to the tempo in the first movement, and you'll notice that it's 4-5 minutes longer than usual! 4-5 minutes longer in the first movement!  I challenge anyone to compare this recording to any number of Horowitz performances (particularly the legendary 1943 and the angry 1941), Argerich's, or Freire's, for example.  This isn't hard.  Go home, put the Lang Lang on, then immediately put the Argerich or the Horowitz on.  If you think Lang Lang's version is "legendary" like some have claimed but you want to know the truth, then you'll try this exercise.  If you can't handle to the truth, then you'll...well, you know very well this won't occur.  Same with his Islamey.  You have to understand that these works are show pieces.  Whether you like show pieces or not, you have to admit that you must fulfill the original intent of the works.  Islamey and the Tchaikovsky aren't profound pieces like Brahms or Busoni.   It won't make you learn something about yourself like Mahler or Bruckner.  It wasn't meant to learn something about nature like Beethoven's 6th.  They were composed for the sole purpose of being the virtuoso vehicle for the pianist.  So, why does Lang Lang play like they are works of Herman Hesse or Dostoevsky?  Why does he suck all life out and try to intellectualize it?  I was flipping through the channels and caught Lang Lang on the Tonight show, about 1/3 way into Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No2.  I remember asking myself, "How on earth can someone this bad get so much props?"  That night, he managed to something that is almost impossible--make the Hungarian Rhasophy No2 sound boring!  I'm not a religious person but I say a few prayers before I go to sleep.  I pray that Hamelin eventually gets his dues in this country.  I pray that Hyperion continues their trail blazing recording efforts, surviving the lawsuit by an imbecile musicologist.  I pray that record companies follow the the examples of Hyperion and Naxos, and record NEW music, and stop recording warhorses like Tchaikovsky or Rachmaninov concertos (except his 4th concerto).  Finally, I pray that record companies stop promoting average pianists like Lang Lang (no matter now their teachers are).  Lang Lang is a sign that classical music is in a bad shape.  Like Travis Bickle said in Taxi Driver, someday a real rain will come down and wash this all away.  I pray and pray every night that this will happen.  If it doesn't, I won't have anything to offer to my children.  How sad will that be 
 they were not as heavy weight as stated..to me they seem more like a regular t-shirt..and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm..after first washing, they really shrink.. I will not buy any more. 
 Let me say at the outset that I am not a macroevolutionist.  However, Morris' simplistic caricature of biologists ("Darwin's theory of evolution is universally accepted among biologists", p3) is far from the only factor that makes this a disappointing book.  Morris is simplistic and repetitive, and in addition to the typo's already mentioned by other reviewers), there are several examples of outright contradictions and misinformation that leave me scratching my head.  On page 21, Morris states that "carbon-nitrogen dating...can rarely be used to determine the ages of rocks in geological formations."  In fact, it cannot be used to date rocks at all, only organic materials.  On page 25, Morris states that "The solar system is full of such [organic] chemicals, including amino acids-the components of proteins..."  I am not an organic chemist, but to my knowledge none of the amino acids found in the proteins of living things have been found anywhere else in the solar system.  If they have, it would certainly be in very limited places and quantities, not littered about the whole solar system, as Morris implies.  In addition, only 6 pages later, Morris states:  "Localized areas rich in organic chemicals are found in the fossil record.  These chemicals must have been produced by microbes of some kind."  Gee, I thought you just said that the solar system was full of them!  On pages 33-34, Morris states:  "It should not be imagined that they [the mammals] survived because they were somehow better adapted than the dinosaurs."  This statement directly contradicts the principle of natural selection, which is the guiding light for evolution and is even accepted in a general sense by creationists.  On page 44, Morris attempts to defend evolution by saying:  "Although many different kinds of genetic codes are theoretically possible, all organisms use the same one."  He uses this as an argument for macroevolution.  However, the logic behind it is fallacious, for the following reason:  genetic code can be (and is) viewed as a language.  As a creationist, it is perfectly reasonable to me that the Grand Author of Life would use the same language to code the information in all living things, just as most earthly authors write all of their works in a single language.    On page 45, under the heading:  Evolution is a Fact", Morris states:  "The idea that life on Earth has been evolving for 3.5 billion years is not a theory.  It is the only possible interpretation of the numerous different kinds of evidence that scientists have been discovering for well over a century."  Thank you, Reverend Morris, Pastor of the Darwinian Orthodox Church.  However, on page 62, Morris states:  "If scientific ideas ever became dogmatic, then no new discoveries could be made."  If ever a contradiction existed, surely this is it.    On pages 56-57, Morris gives the beginning of a reasonably plausible explanation for the evolution of an eye, until he says:  "Finally, full, complex eyes develop", thereby skipping the most problematic part:  the 20+ step biochemical process that occurs in complex eyes from the time that light strikes the retina until an impulse is sent to the brain.  (See Darwin's Black Box, by Michael Behe, if you want a fair discussion of the difficulties that the human eye poses for the theory of macroevolution).    I could go on and on, but I will conclude by adding that I could forgive most of the evolutionary dogma (which is, after all, almost universal in books written by evolutionists) were the book not incredibly redundant, error-filled, and simplistic.  I got a little bit out of the part about evolutionary psychology, but that it about it.     
 My son LOVES airplanes and jets! I bought this DVD based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video. If you want a DVD that shows airplanes/jets flying, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The name of the video should be, "Watch the Blue Angles Get Ready to Fly," because that is what this video is. In the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying. Then the next 25 minutes is NO FLYING just talking and showing the Blue Angles getting ready for their show. In the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show. My son has never made it to that point. He wants to see airplanes/jets fly and I'm now on a new search for a DVD that will do this for him 
 Originally written as a college paper, this book takes the author's personal beliefs and poorly attempts to make them the entire history of a loosely defined set of musical and cultural styles that began probably long before the author was old enough to speak. He's a hippie punk with crusty leanings, which means love, peace, anarchy and not bathing too often, and the whole history of punk is redefined to the point of pretending most everything else doesn't exist. It's hysterical reading his mental gymnastics when describing Anarchy as both violent and peaceful. Anyone who gives this a good review has to be blinded by their own political ideology since this book is soooooooo poorly done. It's not a history at all. It's an editorial steeped in too much wishful thinking 
 Milton deserves better than this.  Orgel and Goldberg boast that they have produced a radical Milton, but all they really offer is rehashed Alastair Fowler, without Fowler's erudition or eloquence.  Many of the notes are  just plain ignorant.  There are better editions out there 
 I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years. When he is at his best, heis books are VERY good. I used to think that even when he's formulaic, at least his books are always entertaining. Recently, I've had to reevaluate him. He can write books that are bad. I was disappointed by "The Taking", and now this... I've been listening to this as an audiobook, but now I'm turning it off. I usually don't write reviews on books or films I don't finish, but this one, I had to give up and feel abliged to warn others.   I made it almost halfway through the book, waiting for something to happen. I really don't care to know how the story ends because it's hardly started yet. There are several parallel plots, all overwritten, with long portions of text where nothing happens and too many characters that feel not realistic, but constructed to be likeable and/or funny. I've always liked the way Koontz writes characters you really get to know and care about, but this time it's way too overdone. They can't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves and have endless dialogues that doesn't move the plot forward. Something must happen for a book to be interesting.  I was a big fan but I'm going to be very cautious about his books in the future. I'm not going to waste more time on this one. Not recommended even (or perhaps especially) for Koontz fans. 
 I was reading another book written by Dr. Llaila Afrika in which he states that Avicenna was a Black Muslim and not Persian like one of the reviewers stated. [Avicenna] "and another Muslim Black named Rhazes influenced European medicine. In fact, Rhazes wrote about a hundred medical books which utilized natural foods, herbal remedies, and diets."  I would also like to know who it was that translated The Canon of Medicine? Europeans? Wouldn't that have been asking for potential biases 
 YO this album can be described in the simplest term - Garbage 
 I am one third through and I am afraid I find the book poorly organized. There are no real step by step examples integrated with data. I have used other step by step books with greater success 
 I was VERY disappointed in this book.  I felt it had very little information about female sexual dysfunction, and TONS of information about the Berman sisters' clinic.  It seemed like every other sentance started with "At our clinic..."  Also, to make matters worse, these so-called experts on women's sexual health spelled vulvodynia wrong throughout the entire book!!!  I recommend "for each other" by Lonnie Barbach, or a book on your specific condition, like "The Vulvodynia Survival Guide" 
 In some books, such as Friends, Lovers, Chocolate: An Isabel Dalhousie Novel the author, in this case Alexander McCall Smith, can write every single thought that pops into a person's head, and all the parenthetical thoughts, and all the asides, and all the options not taken, and then the person can finally just say, "Uh." This is not great writing. This is chatty drivel. BORING (as JoAnn Worley would so aptly proclaim). It's not romance, or mystery, or biography.  In many books I've read, there are redeeming qualities even if the book does not end up on my favorites list. Not this one. Just frustration and plodding plots.  So which is easier to write? In a play, you write what people say, and what they do. In a book, you can write what they think, and add 10,000 words and get paid more. Plays are easier to write, harder to write well. The reading of this audio CD is OK, not great. It's hard to distinguish who is speaking sometimes, because almost everyone has a Scot accent. So, the audio production deserves a 3, the novel a 1. Go read Anita Shreve instead 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 This is NOT the restored print of Dracula 1931 that Universal previously released on DVD a few years earlier.If you have that DVD keep it as the quality on this box set is awful.I can only think that whoever was in charge of compiling this didn't bother to look or didn't know that Universal had a fully restored copy of this film 
 WARNING!  This video has no captioning.  I've rented it and it does NOT have captioning.  It is useless to me and fellow Deaf and Hard of Hearing folk 
 I have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest.  HOWEVER, I was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow Advil.  I used Sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help, but nothing seemed to work.   The taste isn't bad and I used the bleach with my own trays that I had made by my dentist, so it didn't leak out or touch my gums.  My teeth weren't sensitive while I was using it or even right afterwards, but later in the day.  If you have sensitive teeth, I do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain 
 This book is more about mining than about science fiction. The story line could have easily taken place during this time than in the future. The story also takes a very long time to develop and readers will have to struggle to continue reading this book to the end. Furthermore, the characters are very poorly developed, and fictional concepts in the book are poorly explained.   In conclusion, this book is more of a novel than a science fiction book 
 First off, MTV owes me my 10 bucks back for even implying that Just Surrender sound the least bit like the wonderful and talented Fall Out Boy. They don't. When I first heard ITSCT, I thought I was listening to Taking Back Sunday B-sides post-tell all your friends, and I don't even like TBS. Raspy, crude vocals and generic breakdowns are garbage, yet everyone trys to do em' anyway. I took this suckfest of a cd and threw it from my car after just three songs, so unless you like bad imitations of TBS and MCR, stay clear of JS. It's no wonder these guys never took off 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 While Rackham's other books have been thought provoking and practical, this book falls short.  Unless you're a salesperson for a multi-billion dollar corporation, this book is of little value.  If this had been Rackham's first book and SPIN second, I probably would not have read Rackham's other books 
 My teacher read this book to our class today. It was hard too follow because there were too many things going on. I do not recommend this book for kids under 10 
 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway. 
  I really liked the premise of a reading club, with the themes in the books interwoven into the lives of the readers.  But a few pages into the book, I began to feel disappointed.  First, the voices of each of the characters - Harriet, Nicole, Polly, Susan, Clare, Cressida ... sounded exactly alike to me.  Each uses the same adjectives to describe their thoughts and feelings - a couple of times, when I went back to reading after having forgotten to bookmark the page, I'd realize that the page I'd turned to wasn't where I left off - it just sounded very similar.  And then after a couple of hundred pages, I completely lost interest in the characters, as I began to see Noble preparing to neatly wrap up the plots.  I'd probably otherwise have given this book two stars, but I felt so let down after a promising plot in the first three-quarters of the book, that I think it deserves only one star, if that 
 Slow,dull and done on the "cheap"....stick with "Zulu" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining 
 If you are looking for a book on Java and UML or a book that is about UML and uses Java examples; This IS NOT THE right book. The authors give you their way of patterns or archetypes that they call it. If you already know  UML and what to see if there is other techniques or ways of extending UML  this is the right book for you. Another thins about the colors, The idea is  new but not a very good one. Often you tend to print you diagrams and show  to other people. If you depend on their way of modeling you'll have to get  a color printer and since there are text in the  colored areas you'll need  an expensive printer 
 I was looking forward to reading this book to my grandsons, but the edition I received was obviously a "second," so I returned it without reading it. The cover was upsidedown from the print inside. It earned one star only because your system makes no provision for "0" stars 
 I wanted to see this film in theaters. I am a Cronen fan. I admit. I wasn't really a huge fan on Viggo Mortensen. I never read the book, but somehow I was drawn to this film, indirectly.  So, I wait for the DVD. Which isn't such a bad DVD as it is a film. Firstly, there are no surprises. Any surprises this movie could possibly have in store for us was revealed in either the trailer, the DVD cover, or the DVD ad. Viggo's performance as a whole, wasn't too shabby. Ed Harris was obviously the one man shining through this dark and boring movie. So in this small, secluded town Tom Stall aka 'Joey, turns out to save some lives and becomes a hero. Although, it turns out Tom Stall wasn't much of a hero as he was a villain. That's about it. The movie drags it ending around like a dogs rear on the carpet.  The sex scenes felt out of place more than anything. I couldn't stress that enough. I'm going to be blunt. They are too random. They are in bad taste. They are uncomfortable. They are very much disliked by me, personally.  And finally, the ending. The ending was probably the most empty finish I've ever witnessed. Tom Stall goes after his brother, takes care of him, drives back, and Sits down for a nice meal with the family. Three words. Fade to black.  I give this movie 2 out of 5 stars. For two reasons. Some of the action scenes were interesting, and Ed Harris. I would not recommend this film 
 I couldn't figure out if this was a novel or a liberal political op-ed piece.  Which is it Mr. Woods?    Two Dollar Bill pretty much follows Woods' imagination of the normal Stone Barrington agenda, with the inclusion of several underwritten and hidden political personal opinions.  Installing political opionions in his books have been common practice for Mr. Woods, I would know because I have read EVERY SINGLE ONE of his novels prior to Two Dollar Bill.    Political opinions are all fair and well...when incorporated into a politically focused novel, which this isn't by any means, but it would be hard to know it by the shear number of snide, unrelated, and personal attacks Woods makes concerning Bush Administation policies and general Conservatives in America.  To his credit, Woods did respond to an e-mail I sent him inquiring as to why he did this, but couldn't provide ANY justification for it.  Merely that it was his right to do so.  And you are correct Mr. Woods, it is your right to do so...just like it was my right to make the conscience decision not to read any more of your books, which I am happy to say that I haven't.  And coming from a person (me) who has ALL of your novels (with the exception of one) in hard back, most of which are signed, is quite a statement to make.  I've been a fan of yours since the early 90's, but cannon continue to be with your recent, and quite obvious, politically motivated agenda.  Good day to you 
 This novel could not hold my interest.  I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book.  I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her.  Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series.   
 While this book contains a wide range of topics of interest to those considering parenthood, it doesn't cover these topics with very much detail.  I would have found it more helpful if the stories of the women interviewed had been longer than a paragraph apiece.  Overall, this book is useful in that it brings up many important issues for consideration, but in my opinion, it served only as a "springboard" for further research 
 I expected a lot more from this machine. Now that I have it, I still use my old $5 drip coffee maker. The wife is still mad at me for spending our vacation money on it.  Any impulsive male buyers out there: Steer clear, the wife would rather go to the carribean 
 from a very good writer. Absolutely a let-down -- nothing but a very brief untidy mish-mash of foreigners in Florence..My suggestion would be to pick up a copy of Mary McCarthy's stones of venice & florence -- it's a little outdated, but for an equally brief book is packed with fascinating information that will give you a real handle on this fantastic city.. 
 The whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer.  In short, the disjointed story line goes like this: troubled angst-ridden teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit (whose face resembled Iron Maiden's Eddie!) who gives him advice/messages; he escapes death (a jet engine crashing through his roof) because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house; he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny; he discovers some old hag named Roberta Sparrow he knew was an ex. teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'Hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes'; same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him, but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected'.  Are you still with me??!!!  I love sci-fi and fiction, but all this is beyond ridiculous!  That, my friends, is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens' film is about!  I mean, 'Gigli' was a better film for chrissakes!  Even the made-up time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable.  In the end, the ONLY redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like The Church, Duran Duran, Joy Division, and Tears For Fears.  Hardly enough to save the film though.  If you must, rent 'DD' if your curiosity is piqued, but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your (or your parents') money 
 First off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said.  Anyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good..  However, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though..  This DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD..  Finally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft.. That's a huge crime in itself. 
 This book is overloaded with flowcharts, exercises, and tables, but has limited useful content. One slim chapter on developing an instructional plan, most of the rest of the book is fluff about choosing meeting rooms, developing budgets, and similar material 
 Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, "Enderverse".  I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.  I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.  It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics.  Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years.  I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics 
 We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written 
  "Against All Enemies" has them all. Former NSA security advisor, Richard Clarke, manages to encompass almost every episode of White House security policy since the start of his career of working with our Presidents since 1985. In Chapter One, Clarke opens the book with a firsthand account  inside the White House on September 11th. This is the beginning of the Good, the start of the finer part of Clarke's literateness. With detailed accuracy, we assume, he describes the events in the situation room in the White House on as word is just coming in of a terrorist attack. It is a rather dramatic and interesting to see what took place from where the average US citizen wasn't able to witness.    For the next 9 chapters Mr. Clarke writes about his role in the US Government from a first person view, from the beginnings of his career in the Reagan administration to the end in the Bush administration. The first nine provide inside information to the reader about the US's handling of national security. It is also the basis for why a prospectus reader would pick up this book in the first place. The subtitle last time I checked is "Inside America's War on Terror" and not "Inside Clarke's thoughts on why America's executive office is always a failure". Although after reading it, one might believe that was his original title idea. We are fortunate enough that Clarke chose to bestow upon a reader at least two chapters without infecting it with his own blatantly obvious partisan views. Which include Chapter 1; "Evacuate the White House" and Chapter 9; "Millennium Alert". However the rest of the Chapters between one and nine are bearable for the most part compared to the just plain ugly in Chapter Ten and Eleven where the book morphs into  "Against All GOP Enemies". Needless to say the theme has been flowing throughout the entire book, but the ugly part of the book (Chapters 10-11), it is just blatant and glaring to everyone. When you near Chapter Ten, so begins the politicizing of the 9/11 terror attacks.   The first nine chapters are somewhat captivating and entertaining but the last couple are an echo of just about every other anti-Iraq book out there. If that is what your looking for, just search "Iraq War" in Amazon and you may be  blessed with finding a whole book based on the "President Bush`s `failure` in Iraq" endlessly caroled to the point of bloodshot eyes. Richard Clarke isn't Frank Rich (fortunately) so we hope we might be felicitous enough to read something that might contain a bit of originality, which is scarce in the end parts.   He tries to portray himself as a modern day Paul Revere in the war on terrorism. He coincidently had all of the knowledge about Al Qaeda before 9/11 and makes it seem as if the Government saw him as just another "boy crying wolf" Who knows for sure? This is his account and we can take everything as hard-line fact without seeing some exaggerates, discredits, even defamation in between, as written by the hand of God.  Wouldn't there be something Bush did correct during his four years of office? His good friend Clinton had a whole 8 blithesome years to work with his angelic NSA advisor, might be find any credit to a president other than Clinton anywhere in the pages? Giving credit to Bush for anything ends at the extent of  "Bush isn't as dumb as everyone says he is, although he doesn't read many books unlike our immaculate Clinton".   This is not an anti-Iraq book in it's entirety. Perhaps Amazon wishes to sell us that in hopes of the ever so rising polls in disfavor of the war would turn out the "truth-searching" pacifists book buyers. Mr. Clarke does a good job of stuffing every ounce of opposition over every Republican president's foreign policy he has worked with into only Twelve Chapters. Maybe if the 04' elections were so close to the book's release date, we could of expected a lengthier book.  He even managed to stitch a small bit of his dissatisfaction over the 2000 election . Page 244 reads: "What if it (9/11) had happened with Clinton still in office or what if the Fl voting procedure had been otherwise?". A classic Democrat alibi about losing the 2000 election.  An overtone lays within almost all the pages of Clinton= flawless and Bush= evil/oil hungry, stupid, and inept which is murmured to the end. He also makes sure he includes to a reader (potential voter) about Bush's reading habits while in office. It is clear to a reader of any political persuasion that he has clear personal vendettas against many of his former colleagues, including Paul Wolfowitz, late former President Reagan, Steve Hadley, and John Ashcroft. As well as Donald Rumsfeld, but then again who doesn't against him nowadays?  A reader will be bombarded with quotes of Clinton's critics of his attacks on mud huts with a "Wag the Dog" theory to divert attention away from his Lewinsky scandal, a textbook defense of Clinton's foreign policy. Defending bombing Afghanistan and Sudan, makes no mention of what else trigger-happy Bill bombed either or even pizza parities with interns. Clarke entering the business of political criticism isn't afraid of applying double standards in his writing.  He also splendiferously exemplifies playing Monday morning Quarterback with his "thoughts" about the US-led invasion of Afghanistan with a laundry list of "what we could of done better"s. Is there anything the White House could of done to please him? Excluding Clinton, of course. He is critical of every US retaliation (or lack therefore of) to every terrorist attack on Americans since 85'. Mentioning the attack on Marine barracks in Beirut under Reagan, Pan Am Flight 103 during Bush Sr., and September 11th during W. Bush. Are we missing something here? Oh yeah! How about that "small" US warship that was bombed by Al Qaeda that killed 17 sailors and injured 39 almost sinking the boat? Clarke seems rather silent on this attack surprisingly. Dismissing Clinton's failure to retaliate with, it would of disrupted the Arab/Israeli peace talks (Pg.224). Doesn't that tidbit of information merit a bit more than a mere paragraph of mentioning? He was quick to scorn past presidents of failing to retaliate against other attacks, why so taciturn this time? Clarke begins to take note of the attack on Page 227 when discussing Bush beginning to take office in January of 01'. Three months after the tragic attack he says "we could begin to go on the offensive". Thanks Richard, it's about time.  He also calls the American traitor John Walker Lindh "misguided". I would say someone who murders two Americans fighting for their country is more than misguided. A turncoat to start.  He also lacks sources of information. If your going to quote certainties such as "Polls showed 70% of people believe in an Iraq-Al Qaeda connection", some sources would be nice. Critical of the US patriot act, which is surprising for someone who spends his career warning officials about terrorism and security threats. As well as becoming a critic of US relations with the Muslim world. However if you seek any mentioning of the numerous states that are allies in the war on terror (Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, etc.) you probably won't find any listed.   To sum the book up, is to simply say "Against All Enemies" is a memoir of an NSC official unfortunately bitten by the partisan bug but not without some worthy sections to read. The final Chapter is nothing new to readers in 2006. You forget your reading an NSC official's memoir and begin thinking it might be Bob Woodward's book or someone alike. He states the expected; "we did in fact lash out in a largely unilateral and entirely irrelevant military adventure against a Muslim nation (pg. 286)" but he believed Saddam had WMDs before America started out on it's "irrelevant military adventure". Perhaps these mantras constantly chanted today were somewhat new when the book came out in 04'.  If you chose to read "Against All Enemies", Clarke manages to keep a reader's attention with few boring or dull parts. It is an invigorating and insightful account of an NSC official. But if you're an independent seeking the truth, you might want to read an "independent" book, assuming there is such a thing.   
 Like in many business books the authors present their message in a number of examples, each describing how a group managed to do something clearly outstanding. The problem of the book is that the authors do not manage to come up with anything like a coherent framework to explain the success of these groups. Examples are only useful if they show the working of some underlying general principle. In this book, however, examples simply stand for themselves. The stories are nicely written and it is fun to read, but it certainly does not present a theory of successful teams. But maybe, as an academic economist, I am too demanding in this respect 
 The themes in this story were SO repetitive - I get it already! And there were so many details, they bogged the story down. I found myself skimming in lots of places, and don't feel like I missed anything. 
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
 When Alejandro Jodorowsky's debut Fando y Lis was originally released back in 1967, a full-scale riot broke out in the audience, the director barely escaped the theater with his life, and the film was banned. That has got be the best, most intriguing publicity I have ever heard of any picture receiving. Of course, when I heard about this, I simply had to see it. I mean, what could this film possibly contain that could provoke such an extreme reaction?  After watching it, I honestly have to say that I really don't know.  Fando y Lis is by far the strangest, most bizarre film I have ever seen. There is no cohesive narrative, no coherent style, and in the end, no real point. The movie feels like some incredibly strange spawn of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Eraserhead, and 8 1/2, though it is very different (and far more bizarre) than any of those films. This is an art house flick, through and through. Fiercely experimental and filmed on a shoestring budget, its unbelievably loose (almost non-existent) plot follows Fando and his half-paralyzed girlfriend Lis as they search a wasteland inhabited by hoards of...erm...interesting characters for the mythical city of Tar, a paradise on Earth. Or are they even on Earth? In this film, nothing is for certain.  When one watches an obtuse art film such as Fando y Lis, one's first reaction is most likely to try and decipher it and unlock its "message" or "meaning", so to speak. However, there is no such thing in Fando. Jodorowsky himself said that he finds what he doesn't understand to interest him the most, so in reality, no one is going to understand this film, because I'm not really even sure there is anything to understand.  That said, there are still some rather intriguing visuals and scenes in Fando, such as an incredibly striking sequence involving black paint (at least I think it's black paint - the black and white cinematography makes it hard to tell). Actually, this brings me to the point of the cinematography, which, in my opinion, is the most unsettling aspect of the film. Though it was filmed in the 1960s, the black and white is bleached and brightened to an uncomfortable degree, giving one the impression that the film was shot in 1920s. For some reason, it gives the whole picture something of a disturbing aura.  Unfortunately, the fact that this is Jodorowsky's first film really shows. The whole thing seems more like a big experiment than anything else, and some rather amateur editing and borderline laughable sequences ruin a lot of the interesting segments. That's not to say the film is without worth; it makes for a rather interesting watch. But overall, it just feels like a heavily experimental student film with no real purpose. It can be hard to sit through occasionally, but at 93 minutes, it doesn't drag for too long, and it is worth viewing if only for its historical value 
 I started this book with anticipation and the further I went the more disappointed I became.  Whybrow makes an interesting arguement that Americans are slamming up against limits they refuse to recognize - biological limits like how much change the mind and body can absorb.  He calls this the Fast Society and his argument builds upon earlier historians who noted the psychological effect of the closing of the frontier in the 1870's.    Whybrow's primary hypothesis, however, is that there is something GENETICALLY special about Americans because we are descended from restless people.  He traces both innovation (good) and inability to handle limits (bad) to this genetic material.  There are two big problems with this thesis:  First, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and Canada are all immigrant societies, too.  For Whybrow's hypothesis to hold, they must also manifest these traits - irrespective of their political and social institutions.  Whybrow does not think to ask.    Second, Whybrow quotes deTocqueville's Democracy in America at least three dozen times in defence of the special (genetically based) character of Americans.  Yet deTocqueville's most passionate (and perhaps famous) chapter compares the people living on both sides of the Ohio River, in Ohio and Kentucky.  Tocqueville notes that these are ethnically the very same people - often closely related, yet the two societies differed drastically with respect to innovation, industriousness, independence and initiative.  He was disturbed by the slovenly habits of Kentuckians, their disdain for work, their lack of initiative or enterprise.    From this observation, deTocqueville argued that slave-owning was profoundly enervating and corrupting, even of the vast majority who owned no slaves.  That Ohio and other parts of America owed their creativity and restless energy to democracy itself - and that the slave-owning south was not completely democratic, but stunted.  This is one of DeTocqueville's most famous arguments and it directly contradicts Whybrow's hypothesis.  Whybrow never confronts this.  After awhile I started to wonder if he really had read DeTocqueville, or whether some graduate student was supplying him with quotes.    Finally, Whybrow appears unfamiliar with previous (famous) critics of the soul-destroying aspects of American society - Whyte's Organization Man and Roszak's Where the Wasteland Ends come to mind.    
 Not only was this book an insult to my intelligence, it was full of the most awful stereotyping.  The Mexican character Maria is a caricature of a human, something that's not done to any of the other characters in the novel.  Some of my favorite moments come when Melanie refers to Asia as "that backward continent with weird picture letters," and when one boy tells another boy that the only reason people think women like Penelope Cruz and Selma Hayek are hot is because "it's p.c."  The authors must have hired a P.R. firm to salvage their star rating because there is no way this tripe is worthy of three stars.  Don't waste your money on this drivel.  Seriously 
 Don't go for the cool looks it carries... It does not give you a good return. Its Noisy and painful. Gifted it to wife but to tell you the truth, she hated it after use 
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 I was excited about getting this book, but soon realized that you needed to download specific images from the Kevin Ames website in order to perform any of the exercises.  I went through the website registration process and am still unable to enter the lesson images.  A real disappointment 
 Please promise me you will never play this.  It is not worth your time.  If you paid money for it, try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin.  Hard.  Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.  Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.  I don't think I even need to say it, but those crumbums at Square couldn't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too.  They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on, lest they risk making something like this again 
 Maybe it's because Goten and young Trunks piss me off, but I didn't like this movie. The "bio Broly" made out of chemical mud...what was that?? Should have called it, DBZ - Mud Broly.   Watch for DBZ movie 12, comming soon. (This one will rock your world!!! 
    Diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation.  What's next?  How about implanting a uterus?  After all, men are stronger and could probably carry babies better.    Big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game.  But, for Diamond, it leaves the question open as to "What are men good for?"      My question is "What is Jared Diamond good for?" 
 In the words of author Gertrude Stein: "There's no 'there' there." I was very impressed with the first third of this book and then my interest in reading it simply fell off the edge of the table.   The book relies almost exclusively on anecdotal evidence to support its claims, and most examples aren't that well developed. Some conclusions are muddled or, in my view, considered "stretches."  One of my personal pet peeves is that this book is horribly edited. It is riddled with misspelled words and other grammatical nightmares. It was horribly distracting. It seemed like they almost rushed this book to print to coincide with the article in Fast Company magazine.  Even though it's only 159 pages, halfway through this book, I just couldn't wait to be done with it. I'm glad I checked it out of the library. I would have been p*ssed if I had paid $25 for it 
 This little book is, in my opinion, a really poor attempt at humor and a huge disappointment to the wonderful Bridget Jones diaries.  If  you have read the Bridget Jones books, then this little book is unnecessary since it is just regurgitated material from her diaries.  However, if you have not read the Bridget Jones diaries yet, I highly suggest you do that first since this little book might be a turn-off if you don't know what you are dealing with ahead of time.  This book contains silly pictures of how to shove things under your bed before company comes and how to call for Domino's delivery...(yes, there are pictures showing the reader how to dial the telephone, but it doesn't stop there.  We also get photographic details on how to open the box and put the pizza in our mouths!)  If this kind of information could be useful to you then, by all means, get this book.  However, if you are like most of us and already know how to dial a telephone, stick a slice of pizza in your mouth, shove things under your bed and step on a bathroom scale, then I suggest you save your (money) 
 Not only are the other comments on the printing quality correct, but the EXACT SAME BOOK EXISTS in a 2006 EDITION!!  The "Science of Sex" is the original(?) 1996 edition.  The 2006 edition of the VERY SAME BOOK is titled, "Sperm Wars: Infidelity, Sexual Conflict, and Other Bedroom Battles".  Explain to me why the author would reprint his original book under a new title?  Anyway, I'm returning this one, since I bought both books at the same time, thinking they had entirely different content. Furthermore the new edition is of much better printed quality, with none of the problems mentioned about this edition.  One more thing of note...the new edition is HALF THE PRICE of this crappy version!!!  Can't wait to actually read it 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 Jennifer Jason...Can someone PUHLeeze tell me why she ALWAYS plays the same role! ANd why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution!The so called ~Bostonish...or upper crust--east coast accent does Not include..slurring your words as if a consonant was too much WORK.  It as if her upper lip is never engaged at all..Not even to smirk!  Does she have a BOTOX complex..USE YOUR FACE..Including your upper lip... But then again...Maybe she was acting JUST like Dorothy Parker..WHo ahem..happens to be dead..!  ( no disrespect intended..)  Jennifer Beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance..WHY didn't she play Parker..I believed her character!  Gwyneth..Love her..!  Bit part..but she added a much needed warmth to the film..  I cared for one character..And the best part was his bit giving a financial report..I thought that was BRILLIANT..! BRavo..But Mr. Benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character..THANK YOU..  WIll someone Please make this film over..And Do it right..!  And don't just call up your buds..for a tupperware party and say..HEY..Lets make a movie..!  Dorothy Parker deserves MUCH MUCH better..I can't EVEN imagine the biting remarks she would print..How about..  'It's all about me..And I hated it..!But the costumes were nice.. 
 `"I'm of course aware that some believe that Herta von Walther played the Dietrich role in the Garbo film Die freudlose Gasse, "The Joyless Street",' so writes Diana McLellan.  Despite the author's claim that Marlene was in Pabst 's "The Joyless Street," there is absolutely no evidence that any actress other than Herta von Walther played the part of the woman in the butcher line.   McLellan certainly has no proof that Marlene played the part. Therefore any thing she says about her in that role is opinionated speculations.   There is, however, much evidence that Herta von Walther was in that role.    Marlene and Herta did appear together in one film in 1923, Tragï¿½die der Liebe.  There is no evidence that Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich ever appeared in any films together.   The fact is that Herta made four films with the director of The Joyless street between the years 1925 and 1928. The four are Joyless Street, Secrets of a Soul, Love of Jeanne Ney, Abwege.   There is no record of director Georg Wilhelm Pabst having ever made any films with Marlene Dietrich 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book, with it's constant reviewing of past events just made me more sad than inspired to create art.   I am a painter, not a writer...so forcing myself to write all of the time just wasted valuable practice time. ( I also work full time and have a busy spouse that I like to spend time with) so every precious second that i can spend on my art I grab up.   I guess, for pepole who are in emotional distress, this book can teach you how to use art as a thereputic tool for recovery and self esteem. That is fine. For busy, self motivated artists who already enjoy making art...this book isn't going to deliver those fun moments of "get-up-off-your-behind" inspiration. For an energetic, get moving to make art book, read Danny Gregory's "the creative licence" instead.   In conclusion, this book has a lot to offer pepole who have had a troubled past and are working through a lot of anger and sadness, but that wasn't me. I just wanted to make art 
 I read 'Russian journal' soon after it was published and was thoroughly enarmored both with the content and the style of the book. Having lived in the Soviet Union for many years, I remember being impressed by the ability of the author to understand and convey the nuances of the life and atmosphere in 'mysterious' Russia. I've been watching out for and reading her work ever since. Reading her subsequent books, especially 'Interesting women', a collection of stories, gave me an almost secret pleasure, like I was the only one watching her talent grow and blossom. So I had no apprehension when I started reading her latest. Good thing I borrowed it from the library. The only reason I bothered to finish it is that I couldn't believe it would not redeem itself, at least somewhat, before it ends. It didn't. It has 'tentative, hopeful screenplay' written all over it. But even if someone does option it, it can't possibly make for an interesting movie. It has completely unoriginal and cardboard characters, no plot to speak of, trite situations and language. Yes, sometimes I did encounter some glimpses of Ms Lee's former style and force of observation. But on the whole the book reads more like another romance novel than a work of a talented writer that Ms Lee undoubtedly is. Huge letdown. Did I say pretentious?  And what's with this comparison, on page 80: '(Nick) Tall with his straight fair hair and a face that everyone in his office tells him looks as American as a baby's behind'? For more reasons for my dislike of the book - see review by Vaughn A. Carney. A literary 'one-trick pony' seems like an especially apt description 
 I really despise this overrated band who are the worst band ever THE ROLLING STONES. They are huge posers and all their albums awful and they suck.  Mick Thornten is a huge joke of a lead singer, just cant sing, screams, uses make up, and does drugs.  Kieth Richmond is what I call the worst guitar player in the world,ever! He never took guitar lessons,his guitar is funky,always out of tune,can't play guitar,and his strings break on his guitar. He cant even fix his guitar.   Willie Whatts is the worst drummer in the world. He can't play drums and he never took lessons. What an idiot!  Sympathy for the DEVIL is the worst most idiotic song ever recorded by anyone in the industry of music.   This Stones album is as bad as Sticky Fingers.  Go buy a Bon Jovi CD, huh!  Bon Jovi was better.  The Stones are terrible.   One more thing    They are junk.    Adios Amergo 
 I was intrigued by all the reviews here and I am generally pretty open to any kind of mind-trick / soul-searching experience, even if it comes packaged in a box or a book. But I should have known better -- anything that needs this much hyperbolic mystery raised around it should be approached with caution. Clearly this thing worked for the people who praised it in reviews here, but it did not work for me or my companion and, frankly, we found the psychological explanations to be lacking in depth, profundity or any insight beyond the grasp of any remotely self-aware person. For the most part, we felt that much of the text was filler to make the book lognger and thicker. A good chunk of this book, for instance, is dedicated to testimonials by random celebrities discussing their Cube experiences. Some people might be interested, but it was not for us.  Judging by all the good reviews, this thing is actually doing someting fun for someone, but if you are the type of person who has low tolerance for fluff, you will find this amusing -- to a point, but, ultimately disappointing.  P.S. The book does not actually provide you with any decent instructions as to how to play, which, I think, is another hit against it. You will be asked four questions -- make sure to either write down answers -- or have a very clear mental picture of all the details it is asking about 
 Native Son is a book that I was required to read for school. I had high hopes for the book , but they were dashed as I read on. The writing style is extremely sub-par. Wright struggles to get his point across succinctly. The book is characterized by muddled and repetitive narrative. I kept trying to like the character of Bigger throughout the novel, but I was unable to do so. His apparent lack of remorse for his actions is apalling. The argument that his fear and society is the cause of his murders can only apply to his murder of Mary Dalton. His willingness to profit from the murder and sense of pride about it afterword is sick. I see no literary value in this book. We read it because in public schools today we are forced to read literature about how America is racist towards blacks every year. Schools try to jam the theme of racism against blacks down our throats every year in an effort to "emotionally move us" and make us feel guilty for something that occurred long before we were born. I assure you that this book would not have achieved the title "classic" if the author was white. In America we ignore the plight of other ethnic groups and focus solely on the cause of the African American. I get the point we studied it enough already. 
 They are warm and comfortable while they last.   All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out, there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper.  The outside of the slipper still looks like new.   It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months 
 Babyliss Pro Instant Heat 5 Jumbo Roller Hairsetter comes in a compact, useful size.  However, the rollers take a long time to heat up. Even if left plugged in for a half-hour, they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair.  I would not recommend this product 
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 Although this book has been released for quite some time I am just now reading it and I was initially excited to read this novel.  It is the first novel that I have read by this writer.       The basic premise sounded interesting...black and white related through blood who have to unite and put aside their differences in order to defeat a great evil.       Well I felt that alot of the plotted storyline was forced in order to advance the story.  I hate to say it but it was like Barnes was too lazy to exercise his creativity and create a way that made more sense to connect some points in the story.  Some parts were just too tidily handled.  He wasn't creative in the way that suspense in the story was resolved either.  You're on the edge of your seat trying to figure out how they are going to get out of the conflict this time and then something happens that is just too tidy and too convenient to really suspend disbelief.    Also, this is not necessarily Barnes's fault, probably more the editor(s), but the book was full of typos.  And some words were overused in the story.  It was hard to follow sometimes who was speaking during the dialog scenes as well.  Again, more the editor(s) fault?  The character development was "okay."  Barnes was overconcerned I felt with physical descriptions of the characters but he did a fairly decent job from time to time of getting the reader into the character's head.  All in all, I know I will probably not read another Steven Barnes novel.  My time is limited to read though this is one of my favorite pasttimes.  I hate finishing a novel that I am not really all that impressed with feeling like it was a colossal waste of time and that I could have been spending my time reading something more worthwhile. 
 I have been a fan of Peter Carey forever and have read all his work. His work, however,has become more bizare and unreadable with each new book. Weird characters  and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style,Some of his stuff almost crossed the line (My Life as a Fake) to the inintelligible but Theft makes it all the way. I found the characters somewhat boring, and the language, idioms, references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases. Perhaps if you are a Sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense. But for the rest of us---I am really sorry to report the book is not readable. I quit after reading about 2/3ds and for me that is unheard of. I feel like I have lost at good friend 
 I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.  And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then "the False Prophet")   People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear. 
 This is probably the best music/movie magazine out today. However, you can go to Borders books or Barnes and Nobles and get it for $8.95 or something. This deal is BS 
 It's a nice idea, but they are cheaply made and don't last very long.  In the space of 2 years, Brewstation number 3 has just quit working (doing what the other reviewer stated-just blinking on and off and you have to unplug it to reset it).  The first one was purchased new and lasted 13 months-1 month after the extended warranty I bought.  I figured it was just a fluke, and liked the design, so went out and bought another new one.  It lasted about 7 months before it checked out into that big coffeemaker station in the sky.  I wrote Hamilton Beach and was happy that they responded, and they had me cut off the plug and send it to them, and they sent me number 3.  That was about 7 months ago and now this one has percolated it's last.  So, instead of constantly replacing $10.00 broken decanters, I'm spending $50.00 to replace Brewstations.  Great idea, Hamilton Beach, cheap product.  I would pass.   
 This man hates the use of herbs for health reason and this book is nothing but rubbish.  If you are actually interested in the use of herbs then I would suggest you look into another book.  If you are interested in spreading hate about herbalists then this is the book for you.    The title is definately false advertising.  Honest and "anti" opinionated is not the same thing.  
 First off, I hate Broly. But, I do want all the DBZ movies so this is a cheaper way to get them...but, I do have a problem with this box and it's the reason I'm not buying it. I like to put all my DBZ movies in order of when they came out, the Broly movies being movies 8, 10 and 11. So you'd have to take them out of the box anyway to fit movie 9 in. If you don't care about that then get this it is a better deal. But, if you're like me at least now you know 
 Oscar Lopez's first cd was an incredible display of flamenco virtuosity. His sophomore effort displayed none of the fire of his initial effort but at least demonstrated his guitar skills. This, his third outing, continues a downward spiral. Not only is the guitar work uninspired, but, as if realizing his own lackadaisical input, the mix relegates Oscar to a sometimes barely audible, subservient position. There is very little heat and no fire in this cd 
 I am an Ismailli and totally offended by Lewis's book.  He is no doubt a total anti-Muslim racist.  For greater information on the Nizari ismaillis read Farhad Daftar 
 After reading the "Other Bolyne Girl" I was keen to read another novel by Philippa Gregory. However, this was a very disappointing read, it is  poorly written, the story was not engaging and there was little substance.I could not even bring myself to finish this novel 
 this book is the devil! i am using it in a lit studies course and loathe every second i waste reading these essays. they seem to be written mostly by stuffy university professors who are attempting to sound like they know what they are talking about.  It is not a dictionary, nor does it help the reader properly understand a term.  If you are curious about a word that is discussed in the book, i suggest looking it up in the dictionary.  it's easier. and you'll actually learn what the word means without having to search through thick sentences that really make no sense and large words that you know the author just pulled out of a thesauraus 
 Just another wanna be somebody, using the tired old trodge stuff. Like a previous bright lad said, `Heresay`. Wonder why they don`t consider self immolation to get attention....now THAT would be worth reading about. AND we could bring chestnuts. As for George nicking somebody elses song....oh dear. And of course, the only place that the Beatles went, was america. Typical yank author..two places in the world. america and notamerica. Toilet paper might work if the ink isn`t as cheap as the scribbler. Not worth a zac.  BTW the software advised that I HAD to award this crud with at least one star or the review would not get posted...hence the one star where I gave it minus 5 stars (idea would be to give us a choice of bouquets or brickbats doncha think??) 
 Actually, it wasn't that bad of a show . . . but trying to pretend its CHRISTY makes it look fake. If the same Dr. MacNeil had NOT played in it, and if all the names had been changed, it might hold some merit of its own. It was very interesting, the way they seemed to take the type of senarios that were in the CBS series and incorperate them into this show, only with a slightly different slant (i.e. trying to help Zacheriah Holt into college, as was already done with Rob Allen; breaking up school yard sqabbles started by Lundy Taylor; begging Dr. MacNeil for help in tutoring, etc; etc.). However, all of those things only serve to accenuate how UN original and copy-cattish this show is. And Kellie Martin is, in my opinion, the only woman who can play for Christy. Also, the guy they picked for David tended to walk around with a grin painted on his face, while "SMILEY" Miss Alice always seemed perplexed about something. Besides that, the lines were poorly written, and Dr. MacNeil's casual flake with some woman from the land beyond was totally out of charactor. P.S. Lest anyone should think I'm just a grouch who loves throwing around critisism, read my other reveiws 
 I am a big fan of John Bingham, and credit his book "The Courage to Start" as a major inspiration to me to begin running and making it a part of my life.  Even better (if you choose only one of his books) is "No Need for Speed" which covers many of the themes but is a more complete beginner's guide to running. John is a fine writer and motivator especially for those of us who are "at the back of the pack".  That said, I found his training log disappointing. Essentially you have a some running tips from John and Jenny (which are very good, but all are found in his books) and the same single page (the weekly log) copied 52 times and spiral bound.  If this is what you are looking for, it's fine.  I prefer tracking my running and races on an Xcel spreadsheet. Even a regular notebook would do about the same.  The bottom line for me is that if you don't own both of his books, either would be a better purchase. 
 This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book!  They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book...  What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be 
 I bought this CD thinking it was a music CD. Wrong! It was about someone reveiwing the group Panic at the Disco. Apart from background music there was no music what so ever on this CD.  If you are interested in background info on a group then buy this CD. However, if like me, you like listening to music do not buy this CD 
 All the bad reviews here on AMAZON and elsewhere on this television remake of my all time favourite movie (and THE HOLY GRAIL of all disaster movies)made me highly reticent to watch it. So one year after its first screening and seeing the dissapointing but visually spectacular big screen remake, I have finally managed to view this one.  Ok, first off its not as bad as many of the reviewers would have you believe....but then its not that great either. What it is, is a fair television remake that has beeen updated for the 2000's (terrorists and bomb explosions replace the tidal wave) that has some moments of suspense.  The negatives include some of the CGI of the Poseidon (not very convincing) and some of the sets which really dont look like a 135 000ton upside ocean liner. Bryce Zabel (screenplay) has unwisely dispensed with some of the characters, whilst including others...theres no Linda Rogo...Manny Rosen is now dead (Sylvia Syms as Belle Rosen is miscast and her constant "My Manny..." is highly irritating). The Clarke family is obviously The Shelby family from the novel and thats a nice addition. But perhaps Mr Bryce should have used the original novel as basis for his screenplay...it would have been perfect for a 4 hour two part miniseries.  Much of the tension is removed by going to scenes which show the rescue attempts...although they are well handled, and I actually didnt mind them...  Much has been written about 'it not being' realistic for the ship to turn over based on a hole...so I'm not going to go there...suffice to say that the capsize sequence is well done for television movie.  It was also nice to see beautiful Cape Town as the place where the Poseidon sails from and also to be able to recognise many local actors in this movie which was filmed here in South Africa.  As a tribute to the original it is only okay...but taken on its own Hallmark's Poseidon Adventure is passable fair for a rainy afternoon.  
 This may be great a product, but you won't find out through Amazon. After waiting months and getting numerous postponement e-mails from Amazon, I finally cancelled my order. Although Amazon claims this DVD is available, I have a feeling I was never going to receive it. If you're interested, I suggest looking for another vendor 
 The book actually looks like a photocopy of something else, and the information is not very specific. Just business info., not necessarily trucking info. Definitely not worth my time. 
 Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it.  He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines 
 Baldacci takes a hard political turn to the left in his latest thriller. Unfortunately, his politics drive an extremely implausible plot--imagine suicide jihadists using disabling darts instead of bullets against their targets? As always, he builds up the suspense well, but the reader is left to snicker at many of the characters, their motivations and Baldacci's bald anti-american, pro-arab/muslim political views. If he continues on this LeCarre-like journey, I won't waste my time with his future offerings 
 This album is the result of what happens when record labels churn their music for an easy buck. I've enjoyed some remixes in the past, but they were all inspired by an authentic theme...and usually done by a group of artists who worked well together. It's hit or miss with these projects, as many of you already know.   This has all the hallmarks of a manufactured "business process," devoid of what takes music beyond the ken of "muzak." It's no longer hip, ladies and gentlemen, to lay down some cheesey contemporary beats over a classic jazz track. These tracks wander about with no particular theme and no particular originality. Some were catchy, like Bent's remix of Speak Low and Max Sedgley's remix of Peter Gunn. But it's hard to mess up those songs, because Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughn infuse any remix with their magic. The Nina Simone tracks (two) lost me. What a shame. She is complex, edgey and deserves more attention than Postal Service and Album Leaf gave her. (Shame on you Postal Service!) I got this CD as a freebie, burned two tracks, and gave it to my cousin -- who promptly called and told me "it was crap." (He's a musician...so his standards are a bit higher than most.)  PS: All of the original artists are fantastic, so I went ahead and bought the unmixed version (used). I was not disappointed 
 This book was so slow and boring that I stopped reading it after a few chapters. The characters were hollow, their actions inexplicable. In addition, the suspense was zero. I am appalled that so may readers give this book four or five stars 
 Al Norman, who is the "shill of the anti-Wal-Mart union movement," has just written yet another jealous screed against the retailer, since a few years ago he discovered he could make money by doing so.  The book trumps up a "case" against Wal-Mart by taking rare, isolated incidents that occurred (and were corrected) at certain stores and presenting them as day-to-day company policies. In this way, Norman ( as in "normal"?) is able to spout forth his generalizing "Wal-Mart is a big bad bully" mythology.   In place of Wal-Mart's "always lower prices" slogan, he presents the following kind of "evidence" to make the store look bad:   * Always forces its workers to labor "off the clock" without pay: lie - isolated incident; they are paid.  * Always uses overseas sweatshop labor to manufacture its clothing: lie - isolated Kathy Lee Gifford incident; no underage workers allowed.   * Always sells knock-off and counterfeit merchandise that misleads and confuses its customers: lie - sells brand name merchandise.  * Always destroys acres of environmentally sensitive lands to build new Wal-Marts: lie - for every acre of store land, another acre is donated to that same area by Wal-Mart. * Always eliminates competition in towns across the U.S. by illegally lowering prices below wholesale: lie - sells at least 10% above. * Always forces the movement of thousands of manufacturing jobs out of the U.S.: lie - Wal-Mart doesn't manufacture anything, and makers are free to work where they want.  * Always calls "full-time" 28 hours per week: lie - at Wal-Mart, 30 hours or more is considered full time. (Although the lower the full-time designation, the quicker workers are entitled to full-time benefits.)  * Always pays wages so low that many of its employees qualify - and accept - welfare payments: lie - workers earn far above welfare levels, and by doing so couldn't qualify for welfare anyway.  * Always demands millions of dollars in tax breaks to locate in communities all over the U.S., while it earns billions of dollars in profits: lie - tax breaks were not invented by Wal-Mart - they apply for them if they can, like anyone else.  *Always ruins towns it goes into: lie - the store actually contributes far more in jobs, taxes, and in contributions to local charities than any other entity in those areas.   The book by Norman, the self-proclaimed leader of the "anti-sprawl" movement, goes Republican evangelical towards the "sinners" that tun Wal-Mart, and also towards those who shop there, calling for a "boycott" of the store. Where have we heard that before? That's right - in the boycotts by Germans against Jewish shops in the early days of the Nazi movement.  Strange how Norman and his labor union pals never seem to go after those retail chains who don't threaten their pocket books at the moment, on behalf of the "greater good" of the community. No, instead only the current top dog is going to find itself in Norman's sights, and right now that happens to be Wal-Mart. Before that it was Target, and before that K-Mart.   Whoever the current #1 is, that's exactly who Norman and company are going to chase after, because then he can sell his books, and the unions can hope that Wal-Mart finally caves in to their recruiting pressure, and signs up its workers with the old Jimmy Hoffa vanishing pension fund gang.   This is a book that every American shopper should read and laugh at heartily, before then making another trip to Wal-Mart and saving a big bundle of money, as usual. Are author Norman or his union buddies going to make up that loss in your wallet if you stop shopping at money-saving stores like Wal-Mart? No way!  So I can only advise you in this direction: "Friends don't let friends be fooled by union shills!"   (Book Rating: 1 star for stupidity - and general comedy value. 
 Based on the reviews my expectations were higher than they should have been.  I spent some time listening to the CD and frankly I was disappointed with the lack of direction of any of the cuts.  It just meandered from one cut to another and I felt no sense of attachment to any of the pieces.  There is no sense of adventure or becoming part of the music - in fact I thought it was worse than elevator musi 
 amazon sells a one year subscription for $14 which includes a $5 amazon certificate that you get later.  in the actual magazine, the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $10.00  so use the card, save some money and also dont have to wait for your $5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $5 certificate on. 
 While this is very well written novel, the story is woefully below par.  Ms. Flieger has the imagery, wonder, and heart of the fantsy novel down, yet her story - a transformation 'myth' akin to those found in Celtic mythology - is painful to read.    While atrocities happen left and right to the main character 'Mokie' (the name itself made me roll my eyes) that was not the painful part of this book.  The pacing is inconsistant, characters were stock 'types' recycled in thousands of books, and the "SURPRISE" ending was very clear about 1/3 of the way through the book.  All in all it felt as though Ms. Flieger (who is a Professor of modern fantasy, medieval literature, and mythology) felt since she has the tools (all of that knowledge to draw from) that she could write a great book.  And I agree, she is very good at the mechanics of writing - in fact an above par "wordsmith" - but her storytelling is not good.  A dreadful, typical, and almost trite fantasy tale cannot be saved by the technical ability of this author.  I CANNOT reccomend this book to anyone looking for an enjoyable read, but if you are looking for a well crafted book that bears all the hallmarks of good technical writing, then this is for you.     
 I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.    The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.  The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.  1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.  2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making "S" sounds sound more like "H" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.  3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).  I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs.  
 If you've read "A Princess of Mars", don't bother with this one. The sequels a all the same... boring 
 I saw the television series when it first came out.  I enjoyed it, however, because of the TV Station switching the times as to when it would be shown, I was not able to see it to its end.  I just recently read the book....it was great!  I bought the video of the tv series and found it to be wanting in comparison to the book.  Allot of liberties were taken with the television series and it did not follow the book very well.  On the whole though, it was interesting and a good Drama for the family 
 Backhouse tries to give a brief, accessible summary of the history of economics, but the book is so dry that it is almost unreadable.  Although Backhouse brings in some social and political background, for the most part he's just listing people and theories.  His explanations, designed for non-technical readers, are not mathematically complex, and do avoid unneccesary terminology.  But they're written in a choppy, condensed style, without illumination from real-world examples.  The result is just not compelling reading.  And his decision to take his history back to Greek times doesn't really work: the pre-modern thinkers omitted from most standard histories aren't consciously writing about economics.  Rather, Backhouse is inferring economic assumptions from literary or ethical discussions.  This discussion is potentially interesting (although it suffers from the same flaws as the rest of the book), but not really the same subject-matter as the conventional history of economics 
 This review is for the Spanish edition ONLY which I recently purchased (ISBN:8498160162, publisher: Linkgua).  Note, that this is an ABRIDGED EDITION (edición abreviada) and is not true to the original text, this is evident commencing with the first sentence of the book. The reader will get the general idea of the novel, but will not read the words as written be the author.  I submit here an example of the above-mentioned sentence:  ABRIDGED EDITION (ISBN 8498160162): A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido vulgarmente con el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que era el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en los demás arrabales y hasta dentro de la ciudad.  ORIGINAL TEXT: A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido popularmente bajo el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que, sin embargo de haberlo anunciado aquella tarde tan sólo, contra su costumbre, era ya el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en otros arrabales y hasta en Intramuros.  This editing is consistent throughout every paragraph in the book.   If you just want a good read, then this edition will suffice. It is an excellent novel. However, if you are an admirer of the Spanish language, please get your hands on the original version.  
 This just plain sucks.  These people writing positive reviews must never have read good SCIENCE FICTION because this ain't it.  This character, Miles, is annoying and the plot is aimless and he just stumbles upon things and WHammo HE HAS A WAY OF MAKING IT ALL TURN OUT RIGHT.  Yeah!  I JUST WANT TO VOMIT.  He staggers (literally) about the universe slowly rescuing is rag-tag but loveable group of cast-aways, as a  way of healing his own rejection.   Sound like science fiction, not to me.   Just because there are "wormholes" and "spaceships" does not mean this can be categorized as anything but trash.  Its boring, painfully melodramatic, really, really corny and is so in love with its main character that the plot gets second billing. This author is cut out only to write trashy romance novels.  I bought the first two omnibus books in this series and wished I had just stabbed my eyes out before I did 
 This record blowz. The tunes last forever -- one verse after another, same crap melody over and over, no drama, no nothing except the old ennui, which I guess is what appeals to some folks. And Lenny couldn't manage to sing in tune for more than three consecutive notes. He's improved somewhat over the years, but you all really need too look up from your "Fleurs de Mal" once in awhile. Poetry is poetry, music is music, and while Leonard's poetry may speak to you, his music sucks 
 while the history of Roger Bacon was interesting and the  other historic figures(Aristotle, Soccrates, etal) I was expecting more about the actual manuscript and how it was deciphered and those around that quest. Instead the book spends over 2/3s relating stories of how various famous figures interacted, political climates and philosophies. This is nice background but it could have been shortened, in this reader's humble opinion.   If you want to know more about the Manuscript, look to another book. 
 I bought this item for my daughter and it is not worth the money.  The items are cheap plastic and some are even cardboard.  This would be a great deal if offered at the dollar store.  Pass 
 This was one of the few books I just could not get through. Managed about 2/3 and just gave up. At least to the point where I called it quits, the plot was just goofy. 
 This book was really dreadfully boring it had a good plot and good story behind it but nothing more just plain boring i had to skim through pages to get throut it... 
 For me, Krazy Kat by Jay Cantor was the third in a sort-of trilogy of novels that retold the stories of various comic book type characters.  Zorro (maybe not a comic book hero, but definitely close in fashion) by Isabel Allende and It's Superman by Tom DeHaven were retellings that were faithful to the original characters and stories and both were delights to read.  Krazy Kat is not, but it's not the fact that it is revisionist that makes this book fail; instead it's the fact that it's a mess.  For those unfamiliar with Krazy Kat the comic strip, this book should definitely be avoided, as it would be like trying to watch a single episode of a serial and understanding instantly what's going on:  it just won't happen.  You need the history to get the present picture.  But for those who dare go in without this familiarity, I offer this brief description:  Krazy Kat was a comic strip that ran in the first half of the 20th century.  Krazy was the main character, who loved Ignatz the Mouse.  Ignatz did not return the feelings, instead choosing to constantly bean Krazy Kat in the head with a brick.  But Krazy only thought of this as a sign of affection.  The third character was Offisa Pup, who loved Krazy and would run Ignatz off to jail.    It was a simple concept, but brilliantly executed, so through the decades, the strip remained fresh and is considered by some to be the best comic strip ever.  In particular, it was a favorite of various big name celebrities such as Walt Disney and Charlie Chaplin.  Even now, among its fans, Krazy Kat is considered more than a comic strip.  It is considered art.  Cantor's novel focuses on the premise that Krazy and Ignatz viewed the atomic bomb test in 1945 New Mexico.  For Krazy, this forced her (Krazy's gender tended to fluctuate in the strip) to accept reality in a way she never had before.  Suddenly, the bricks began to hurt.  Krazy retires from the strip and becomes something of a recluse.  Ignatz, who wants to get back to work, tries to cure her.  The novel is told in five sections:  the first section tells of the onset of Krazy's problems.  The second section deals with Ignatz's psychoanalysis.  The third has them getting involved with motion pictures; the fourth with them joining a revolutionary group and the final one deals with their "romance" in an off-beat manner.  I imagine that this novel would have a very limited appeal.  First of all, it would only be read by those familiar with Krazy Kat, but many of those people would be fans and would view this as a desecration of their favorite characters, especially in the last, mildly pornographic portion of the book.  So it would only possibly appeal to those who can take the abuse these characters will get.  Fan as I am of the strip, I'd still be willing to read something revisionist if it was done well, but here it isn't.  This book, as stated before, is a mess.  Cantor, in his attempt to be literary, often fails in his attempt to be readable.  This book was a bit of a chore to read, with barely enough quality to merit two stars.  The humor is either overly subtle or like that brick to the head.  This may be one of those books that gets better the more times it's read, but I don't know if it's worth the effort.  My recommendation is to skip this book and buy a collection of the original strips instead (many of which will cost almost the same). 
 Who the **ck are GNR?? Plus they make awful music! I can't stand this annyoing album. The music is awful, so as the lyrics. There is not ONE good song on this piece of s**t. It is a album that contains 12 crappy songs. AXL ROSE is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly, and SLASH is terrible too. In THE WAY STAY AWAY FROM THIS AS WELL AS GNRS OTHER ALBUMS.

 nice boots, soft, warm inside, but too bad they sent me two different sizes! i have 11.5 mens, and they sent me a mens 11 and a mens 12 and i ordered size 12.   boo hoo. 
 This book really puts into perspective the way Disney handles its affairs, especially relating to merchandising their name.  I appreciate Carl Hiaasen's humor and point of view.  And he is right when he points out that people tend to trust the Disney name no matter what 
 I have read Animal Farm for a school text and I really was dissapointed by how poor the novel really was. Even though the story was partially based on the Russian revolution I believe the story was very basic and almost childish if you knew nothing about the historic points behind it.But even knowing the historics behind the novel it was boring to the last.To many parts of the story are just recollections of what happened during the revolution and it just reads like it was copied out of a text book and the caracters are added to get the kiddies reding it. The novel was very pradictable and reads like a primary school text. The characters take to many traits from humans and not enough traits from their own species. And another point I would like to add is, who is this story meant for, adults or children, because for me it is to childish for adults(with the use of animals and primary school wording) and to old for the children (the violenceand the actual theme of the story) Thankyou for reading 
 Not The Original Film. Doesn't have the original disco scene with "I like the night life" song. THEY COMPLETELY RUINED THE MOVIE 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 What is Butz looking for? Nice well kept cemeteries, with impressive granite monuments?   Is that what it would take to satisfy him?  So he thinks that the 15 miles of file drawers of Nazi documentation at Bad Arolson are all made up, imaginary?  The Allies took plenty of pictures of the bodies they found at the concentration camps when they liberated them.  As for the bodies the Nazis "processed..."  My parents are both concentration camp survivors. I visited Auschwitz with my father almost 20 years ago.  In the little theater they have there, I saw films the Nazis had taken themselves. We saw films of bodies stacked among railroad ties and being set aflame in the town of Chelmno.  My father, in a quiet but resolute voice, told me that answered the question for him of what happened to his 37 year old mother and 10 year old brother, who had been transported to Chelmno early in the war when the Nazis liquidated the Jewish population of his small town of Lask.  My father and grandfather spent several years in the Lodz ghetto after that, performing forced labor for the Germans, before being transported to Auschwitz.  My grandfather died within days of liberation. At the time my father was liberated, he weighed 78 pounds, and at 17 was the sole surviving member of his family.  In 1977, he went back to Poland, and brought back a small jar of ashes and dirt, that are now buried under a monument to the martyrs of Lask in their burial association plot in Elmont, Long Island.  There must be a special place in hell for those who use their time and energy to deny the Holocaust. I know why it's important to me, I simply cannot fathom why they feel compelled to deny something so well documented 
 This stuff smells bad, like a mix of medicine and pesticide.  Had to throw it out 
 This book has some useful information on fasting and natural hygiene, but I found it extremely difficult to read through the book to get to it.  For those who are devout Christians, the book is probably wonderful.  For those  who are of other faiths, or who prefer books in which God is not referenced  in literally every sentence, this is not a great choice 
 Went to her latest "concert" and let me tell you, save your money.  It's not so much a concert as her own little political rally.  You get to hear whats left of her voice in between her political diatribe and side show.  Mindless socialist drivel. What Babs forgets is that she is the beneficiary of our democratic financial empire.  But she defends and comforts the socialist leaders of the world.  Funny Girl indeed. Let her go live in Cuba with the Dixie Chick 
 I was excited when I saw this book at my local book store and after flipping throught it made an immediate decision to purchase.  I wish now I had looked at it a little longer before buying.  There are parts of this book that I just loved and parts that I hated... because they were not there.  While I feel that this has the potential to be a wonderful reference overall, I feel short-changed because of the sections missing which dealt with some important bikes.  This is in spite of the advertising on the back cover which clearly states that it contains information on every American motorcycle made in the relevent time frame.  For example, this book divides the Excelsior chapter into two parts.  It covers Excelsior from 1907 to 1924 and states on the bottom of page 105 that "The Super-X is treated as a seperate marque later in the book."  Well, it's not there.  The 15 page section they did on the big Excelsior is wonderful, but Excelsior's Super-X is nowhere to be found.  I felt cheated. If they had done half as good covering the "Super-X" as they had done with the earlier Excelsiors, I would have been very happy.  Also missing is the section covering the Yale motorcyle.  Page 25 says "Yale data are contained within the Yale section."  Well, once again there is no Yale section.  Overall, an important work.... fatally flawed by omissions.     
 Jerry Garcia was a stone cold genius.  The Grateful Dead was his backup band.  Bob Weir's solo work is easily as good as the solo work of Bill Wyman, Keith Moon, Dave Davies, and Clarence Clemmons. From a 40 year career this is the "best" they could come up with 
 I so hate to say it, but this book was an embarrassment to the series. I bet poor Lilian is rolling over in her grave over this one. It was much to do about nothing. I used to really enjoy her series about Qwill and the cats; however, I do believe if they can't get better ghost writers for poor 'Lil', then it's time to put old Quill and the cats to bed. 
 Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God "out of the box," such as Tiffany Snow's "Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect." Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's "7 Laws" though, and some of his other works 
 this band should have hung it up long ago. how many songs can you write about being punk, drinking, glue, and unity. All the songs sound the same and its just boring. Sorry all u street punks.......oh sorry punx, generi 
 In my opinion there are two Iranians.  The Iran represented by the thieves and the scoundrels who supported the Dictator  homosexual Shah of Iran and who took off right after he was disposed of his power by the brave students.   This group held so much power in Iran and stole the wealth of the hard working Iranians. Europe and America was their play ground.  While Iran had so much natural resourced, this barbaric savage group, controlled everything.  The poor  were left uneducated and  their child mortality rate was one of highest in the world.   Shah lived in palaces where toilets and showers were solid Gold. While the majority of Iranian went hungry and destitute.    The other groups constitute those who supported the revolution (mainly students and intelligentsia) . This group still believe in the dream Khomeini and his Mullahs had for Iran.  But with the US economic embargo against Iran since 1979, it is hard for Iran to achieve its potential.  Of course the youths who never saw how their parents lived under that despot (H.I.M)  think America is their friend. America has never been friend to the Iranians except to those who wanted to hand Iran's recourses on a silver platter or a golden toilet.  What's funny is those who supported Shah are now living as second class citizens in America feeding their worthless children the same propaganda the usa media inflicts daily on its citizenry as showed by the previous reviewer.  I had the misfortune of meeting such people in school, and most of them especially the girls are semi-prostitutes without morals or direction. Now they went the good women of Iran to follow their immoral lifestyle.....No thanks! 
 Pros:  Lite-weight, easy to use, long battery life.  Cons:  Cat hair gets wrapped up into the coils and is difficult to clean out.  Does not pick up all of the dirt and hair.  Spits some of the dirt back out when you pull it backwards.  When you press the off button, dirt comes out of it.  I will not buy this sweeper again.  
 The cushion was designed for what I needed due to an injury, but the curve of the cushion, the pressure points, and the density of the cushion are wrong.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I have found a similar cushion that works very well 
 I try to have a lot of tolerance for bad music, but this... oh, man. Their worst song is "Snake", it sounds like they're DRUNK. Their voices are horribly out of sync, and it just totally destroyed the music. I listen to black metal, gothic, I hear the hardest stuff on the planet, but this garbage just makes my ears bleed 
 I had to read this in school as a kid. The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing. I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events. Steinbeck has none of that in this book. The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book. Things go from bad to worse as the little boy's dreams are shattered. Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story. As an adult I know it's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still don't like this book and think it's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories. I know it's supposed to be a classic, the problem is I don't know WHY! Some readers say "this is a great book for readers of all ages" but I would have to disagree! I don't think this is a kids book. I don't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I don't think I would ever read it again. 
 In "Not a Suicide Pact," Judge Richard Posner offers an argument for sweeping executive power in the "war on terror" both better reasoned and more thoughtful than John Yoo does here.  Still, as one of the architects of the Bush policy, Yoo's work offers a fascinating, and at times chilling, insight into the thinking within the White House. For the most part, Yoo's arguments remain on at best fragile legal footing, often cherry picking evidence and benefiting greatly from the fact that this book, like all books, is a monologue rather than a discussion.  Despite that, one might at least hope that, as a lawyer, Yoo would at least create defenses that pass the smell test.  Examples abound of thin arguments in support of administration policies.  One must, however, give Yoo credit for taking positions few would want to make, such as arguing for the constitutionality of the since repudiated internment of Japanese in WWII as an example of the legitimate use of executive war powers.  Of course that the Senate had, in '42, actually declared war, is a detail given scant attention. Nor does the author ever give much consideration to the rather ambiguous notion of "a war on terror" never choosing to wonder as to how one determines the end date to such a struggle.  Likewise does this self proclaimed conservative claim that the post 9/11 Congressional resolution for war in Afghanistan gave the president cart blanch to violate civil liberties, this despite the fact that the majority of legislators state that this was far from their intent.  So much for conservative notions of legislative intent.  Nor does Yoo seem bothered by contradictions in his own argument.  Thus, he claims that citizens need not worry about executive excess, since these will be reined in by the judiciary.  Yet at the same time, he decries the judiciary as overly meddlesome. Similarly disturbing is the author's apparent ease in dismissing the central role the constitution gives the legislature in governing, in effect turning the Framer's intent on its head by arguing for a near unrestrained executive.    In the end, simply for the window Yoo offers into the administration, this book proves worthwhile, though all and all the view proves frightening.  Though I disagree with him often in his book, Judge Posner offers a far more thoughtful and honest defense of current efforts by the White House to claim greater power.  Yoo, on the other hand, here will convince no one other than those true believers who've already shared the cool Aid.   
 One reviewer said, ``First, Barbosa attacks Morris Kline (he's got some nerve doing that) for Prof. Kline's supposed lack of understanding of mathematics. This frivolous insult is so ridiculous that it isn't necessary to discuss it further.'' I won't claim that Kline doesn't understand mathematics, but it is quite clear from this book that he does not understand logic. I looked up reviews in the professional literature by logicians and found they made the same point.  Kline makes many technical errors in his account of the foundational debates in the early twentieth century. My favorite mistake, and perhaps his most blatant blooper, is Kline's statement that the Loewenheim-Skolem Theorem implies Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem; he thinks that models with different cardinalities cannot satisfy the same sentences. (For non-logicians: they can and do; Kline's alleged implication is wrong.) His account of the history of mathematics is not as bad.  Kline was an applied mathematician, and in his last two chapters informs us in very strong terms that applied mathematics is good and true, but pure mathematics is not. He urges mathematicians to abandon the study of analysis, topology, functional analysis, etc., and devote themselves to the problems of science.  The book is lively and entertaining, if not entirely reliable 
 Very basic techniques for the readers new to spiritual healing. Nothing new or that has not been said better by more advanced authors 
 I'm a hardcore Lynch fan and find this album a big dissapointment. I like his older season of da sicc style nott this new stuff. In one song they're talking about louie vitton, thats not the lynch i kno 
 I bought this after seeing Mark Morton of Lamb of God reference these guys and Duane Dennison as worth a listen. What I heard was bad production, shoddy vocals, generic guitar, and overall dullness. Steer clear of this is you like good music 
 Chainfire is, quite literally, the worst book in the history of mankind. Open it up to any random part of the book, and you will most likely find both pages filled with one speech or another by Richard that any decent writer would have put into a page, (and only one such speech!!!) and then continued with the story. however...THIS ENTIRE BOOK is filled with Terry Goodkind's absolutely useless Ayn Rand like drivel delivered in chapter long speeches delivered by the main character Richard. I suppose it is a decent philosophy, but trying to insert this book into the sword of truth series should be a crime. Terry Goodkind deceived every one of his readers, who wanted to read about Richard battling the Imperial Order, into reading something that should only be presented in a philosophy class---and a 7th or 8th grade one at that. It reminds me of having read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand in my freshman year of high school...and thinking that it was the most horrible waste of paper ever...and Chainfire is an even worse imitation of that book. This book is absolute garbage and currently graces my fireplace in the form of ashes and soot. Don't buy it unless its cheap enough to be worth its weight in firewood.     
 Reading Reclaiming God's Original Intent for the Church  reminds me of panning for gold in a river; there is allot of useless mud and dirt but every once in awhile you come across a tiny gold nugget.  Overall I was incredibly disappointed with this book. I felt like I was simply reading another polemic against The Purpose Driven Church, or two men whine about what they dislike about the "modern" church, instead of really pinpointing what God's intent is.    Three things really aggravated me about this book.  The first was the tremendously poor church history that is implored.  The authors contrast some magical perfect pre-Nicaea church that never existed, against this tremendously flawed corporate "Christendom" that was birthed by Constantine. Their claim, that if only we can shed modernity and get back to our early-church roots is a complete farce, because it fails to understand that the church throughout the ages, yes even the early-church, was made up of sinners.    Secondly, I was offended by the broad generalizations they made.  As a former youth pastor I was insulted by their claim that many youth ministers leave there ministries because they are looking to climb that corporate ladder (118). I don't think the general statements that the authors make in this book are part of God's intent for the church.    Finally, the chapter entitled "It's About Listening-Not Just Preaching" was awful. The authors are correct to say in counseling and evangelism Christians spend way to much time talking instead of listening.  However, they have gotten good counseling confused with good preaching.  As a matter of fact I would argue that one of the reasons the church has become so irrelevant is that there are very few gifted preachers in this country. Romans 10:17 say "faith comes from hearing the message." I would contend that preaching is central when it comes to reclaiming God's original intent for the church.  I will say that I did appreciate their point: that the role of pastor is about a calling and not a career.  I believe there is something to learn from the church of Antioch; that sent people of proven maturity and effectiveness to new areas. I would claim one of God's original intents for the Church is to send young pastors to our modern day Antioch parishes (large and stable churches). And dispatching our pastors of proven maturity and effectiveness to unchurched areas, instead of vice versa.   This book is a quick and easy read; however it does not come close to effectively reclaiming God's original intent for the church!       
 and this book sends the message that it is.  Borrowers don't "borrow" things; they steal them.  This book teaches kids that, as long as you don't get caught, taking things that don't belong to you is a-okay.  Being "seen" is, after all, the only thing that Borrowers worry about 
 If you like sin and think you are greater than God, then this book is for you!!! If you think that just maybe God had some kind of plan and some kind of power and exhibits any kind of justice, then the heresy here is going to be way too much.   First off, the writer claims his hand was controlled against his will. That is supposed to be comparable to the biblical authors. WRONG. No theologians teach that idea. Oh wait, cult theologians teach that idea. Hmmm...  Secondly, this qoute is amazing. "I do not forgive anyone because there is nothing to forgive. There is no such thing as right or wrong and that is what I have been trying to tell everyone, do not judge people. People have chosen to judge one another and this is wrong, because the rule is "'judge not lest ye be judged." I ask: Is there no right or wrong, or is there? In one paragraph, a huge contradiction. Not only that, the author has no clue what that verse means. It would only take actually reading the Bible to understand what that verse actually means. But, that would require thinking, not just pandering to a postmodern, moral relativity, every body is OK world.  This book is the biggest load of garbage to ever come out of the printing press. CS Lewis said "I don't want my image of God. I want God." Augustine said "If you read the gospels and only believe what you like, it's not God you believe, but yourself." Think about that before buying this heresy 
 I have collected every Windham Hill Christmas album back to Winter's Solstice I. As with every holiday season, I looked forward to Windham Hill's  latest collection. But this year's version is a total ripoff. It is merely a recylced collection of songs from previous Windham Hill Christmas CD's that I already own. Even though the cover says "Windham Hill presents a new collection of timeless Christmas favorites," every song was on a previous Christmas or Winter's Solstice CD. If Windham Hill had practiced truth in advertising I would have never forked out $19 for a bunch of songs I already have!!! This rating only reflects my anger at getting ripped off, the music is 5 stars 
 It is very evident that the author is not familiar with the game of Soccer. He has written a book that simply accounts lives (that are nothing short of boring)  with a Soccer game thrown in on the side. This is ok for  the Oprah show but not as a book recounting a great  sporting upset.  It  would been have far more interesting if the book explained in detail the  then current global state of the game , and  some history of the U.S  national team up until that time.  How did they get entry to the World Cup?  were there qualifying games?  Give more analysis to the actual game. Were  there any more goal chances for the U.S. did the English control the game  for long periods?  The book also does not give enough attention to the  actual 1950 finals themselves. In short a disappointing boo 
 Despite the hyperbolic praise on the back cover--best war novel of the twentieth century!!!--I found this Ballard offering so tedious and unpleasant that I gave up on it just thirty or so pages before the end. My main problem was with Jim; he's basically the only character and he's so unlikable that after a while you just don't feel like spending any more time with him. In Jim you also see the germ of the fascist leanings so evident in the main characters of the truly execrable--but at least readable--Ballard novels __Cocaine Nights__ and __Super-Cannes__.  In my opinion, if you want to read the semi-autobiographical adventures of a boy in an occupied country, you're better off with __The Painted Bird__. If you prefer books about life in prison camps, try __If This Is a Man__ or __The Truce__ by Primo Levi. You'll find in his books the humanity so glaringly absent in Ballard's 
 Why do we think that girls won't learn history unless it is spoon-fed to them in People Magazine form?  This book proceeds on the outlandish assumption that the 13-year-old daughter of Paul Revere had a crush on leader of the Revolution Joseph Warren, 20 years her senior, and was angry at him because she thought he had a crush on her step-mother, Paul Revere's wife.  While there's no historical basis for any of this, most of the book is taken up with the daughter's inability to tell Warren that she's sorry for treating him badly, with a few actual facts thrown in.  While Paul Revere's story is one of the most exciting of the Revolution -- and in fact there's an argument there would have been no Revolution without him -- you won't learn much about it from this book unless you already know the facts and can pick up on some elliptical references.  What's worse, you come out of it having no idea whether any particular "fact" you just read has any historical basis.  A much better choice is "In Their Own Words: Paul Revere," by George Sullivan, real history, and easy to read 
 If your IQ is less than your age, you might actually like this book. I was forced to read this as an assignment for a college course, and I lost all respect for anyone stupid enough to be swayed by such a weak argument. Shiva uses only fear and hyperbole to convince the reader that corporate America is out to destroy everything, much like all the other pieces we read in that course. I beg of you, don't submit yourself to this ... (can I say that?), for if you are really stupid, you might be persueded by it. This is the stuff that people who support acts like the Word Trade Center attack read for inspiration. Just ask my professor 
 To call this year's edition of Best American Poetry a triumph of mediocrity would be sufficiently charitable an act to count as one, perhaps two, of the three miracles required for sainthood.  It is, in fact, a triumph of badness: in evidence here is bland, tepid, listless language; strained and ultimately fruitless attempts at humor; clarity at the expense of vision, imagination, rich language, innovation.  Do not be fooled into thinking this anthology contains poems constituting any sort of "survey course" in modern poetry; it is, instead, made up of that particular brand of poetry, poetry-by-friends, which one man in a position of authority in the poetry community (David Lehman) happens to enjoy, and in this he is at odds with most of his contemporaries--for whom how well you write is substantially more important than who you know, who you've studied under, and where you live (cf. New York City).  This anthology casts a shockingly short net in a remarkably deep ocean of literary talent.  If you're looking to tune into what's happening now in the world of poetry, buy any book by Joshua Beckman, Sarah Manguso, Rachel Zucker, or Dean Young (some of whom have appeared in the BAP series, but never represented by their best work, and only intermittently, at that).  Or re-visit the best work of some masters (for whom the same caveat applies): Gerald Stern, Jorie Graham, and especially Franz Wright.  Don't squander even a penny on this insipid and uninspired garbage--everything here is either the wrong poem by the right poet or the wrong poem by a poet with the right connections 
 I'll be up front and say I never finished this book. I have about 70 reviews here and this is the only one on a book I never finished. It wasn't that it was terrible or lacking in information, it's just that it was so, so boring and superficial. All the encounters with Hitler had all the emotion of checking out a book from the library. The behind the scenes may have come later, but by a third of the way through I wasn't going to wait around to find out. Plus it was hard to overcome the feeling that there was no way this wasn't going to be a self-serving attempt by the author to restore his public image.  Again, I didn't finish, so take my review for what it's worth, but it's rare that I read that far on a book and then find it so dull I lose all interest 
 In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.  from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.  everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.  it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.  
 It was difficult to stay "tuned-in" to this book.  A few good ideas, but nothing new or different.  It is not a book that I would recommend, however, I might try to listen again -- just to see if I missed the point.  I certainly would NOT give this book as a gift 
 I used to love Outburn magazine. I first discovered it when I came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain. The first thing I saw on the cover was VNV Nation. I bought that issue and soon after that I ordered a subscription. What I loved about Outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that aren't covered in the mainstream music magazines, namely those in the goth, EBM, synthpop, and industrial scene. Unfortunately within the next year and a half, the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands, two genres I don't give a rat's behind about. I don't know WTF happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music I would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to. Just like Alternative Press, Outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends 
 It is difficult to understand why this novel was voted one of the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century by the online members of the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association.  The plot is hackneyed, the writing average, and the characters predictable.  There are several literary references along the way (mostly Shakespeare), explained by the author in case the reader is too illiterate to know their source.  She also indulges in some of the most overwrought metaphors I've come across in a long time.  As an American trying to affect the tone of being British, George annoyingly uses "upon" instead of "on" and "about" instead of "around" so often, it becomes a detriment of the rhythm of the text.  The best I can say for the book is "much ado about nothing. 
 Excellent book for the fairy lovers and craft people like m 
 The pictures in this book are very off putting. Yuck! If I had realized what the pictures looked like I would never have bought this book 
 the complaints about this dvd release are all correct. great movie, low qaulity release. yet i'm surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most, the self censorship. the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer. we're ok to witness a pirate being drunk, but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate?  what are the execs at disney thinking? if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such "questionable" material as they did with many of the vault collection... fine, but stop chopping up the movies. our ten year old children are not buying these movies, many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we're being ripped off. stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance. keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title 
 I bought this biography because I have always been fascinated with Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in her husband's administration.  I was hoping for an objective look at her contributions to policy, instead, this novel is full of acrimonious allegations and innuendo.  It seems that the author is completely unable to separate HRC the person from her politics.  This book is horribly slanted and I would not recommend to someone who truly desires insight into either one of the Clintons 
 I know that humor is a matter of opinion, but I was somewhat embarassed after sending this to someone starting chemotherapy.  I stopped by to see how she liked it and her reply was that it didn't seem funny.  I looked through it and didn't find one page that was funny to me.  Sooo, I sent it back and don't recommend it 
 Wow. Perhaps I'm just missing some awesome thing about the Stooges, but I was thoroughly unimpressed by this album. I only found 2 tracks that were listenable, "1969" and "No Fun" both of which sound pretty mainstream for the time period. The rest was some bizarrely boring attempt at being progressive or intriguing that in my opinion failed. I can't say too little about this album 
 With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of "filler" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once 
 With so many serious perspectives available on "peak oil", there is no reason to waste time on this screed, which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates (and he hates, of course, all that which he does not understand).  He hates: the American south and its culture, Wal-Mart, interstates, strip malls, the Arab nations, and most of all, suburbs and the people who live in them. He loves: Israel, the liberal Northeast as it was fifty years ago, Israel, hateful rants, and Israel.  Peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the Arab states will lose their power along with their oil, how the suburbs and Wal-Mart will collapse without cheap motoring, and the greatest reach of all: how the South and West will, for some reason, suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable. Despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil, and have the least access to alternatives: solar, wind, biofuels. This last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the American population from the dying Rust Belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south.  Of course, he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil; back then he was making the same arguments about how Y2K was going to destroy all those things he despises. As were a lot of the other peak oilers.  Everywhere Kunstler goes, he sees only ugliness. This is to be expected. The ugliness lies within him, so he will never escape it.   Give this one a wide berth and learn something about Austrian economics. You'll be glad you did 
 One would think that with the title, THE NARNIAN, you would find some relationship between C.S. and THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, but the author writes few details of that relationship that would make interesting reading.  Instead, Jacobs goes off on tangents that have no relationship to Naria nor THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.  The book relates mostly about the relationships between other authors and Lewis, main Tolkien.  I wanted to read about C.S. Lewis as the "Narnian."  No new information, unfortuantely! 
 Don't waste your time or money on this one.  This book is terrible.  Whatever happened to Amanda Quick writing great books.  She used to be my favorite autor.   It will be a long time before I ever purchase another one of her books. 
 I purchased this adaptor because the listing said it worked with all Tom Tom GPS navigators. To my surprise it did not fit my Tom Tom One GPS navigator and I ended up breaking the end of the adaptor trying to force it in. Look up the USB wall adaptor for the Tom Tom One and save the frustration of ordering the wrong adaptor 
 I bought both the Ahi Tuna Jerky and Salmon Jerky. Both were dried out and brittle. Absolutely the worst.  Incredibly, the Salmon Jerky was worse (i.e., drier, harder) than the Ahi Tuna Jerky 
 I have been listening to country music for probably 8 or 9 years, ever since I was really little and listening to Crystal Gayle. So i'm not just typing nonsense. This CD is not like any other Jo Dee Messina's songs and past albums, the songs have no tune or melody instead she just hollars, She is not a bad singer, and a REALLY good performer. Just these songs have no country swing. The only two good songs on the CD are Delicious Surprise and My Give a Damn's Busted Of corse this is0 only my opinion, and I don't think it was a good bye, and wish I knew how the music was before I bought it 
 While this Modern Library edition is attractively produced, all teachers and students who hope to use it in an academic setting should be aware that this is a severe abridgement--it represents about one-eighth of the original text from 1660-1669.  As a result, there are large gaps in continuity, exacerbated by a lack of editorial notes to fill in those gaps.  Also, the abridgement omits many of the sexiest passages and seems tailored to a Victorian sensibility.  .. 
  "A massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. Anything that flies on anything that moves." This is the message 'diplomatic' message Nixon-Kissinger team gave to the millitary. In Kissinger's view diplomacy is whatever you can get away with; sadly that's easy if the audience knows very little.  
 I agree with Susan Taylor's review.  I have read other books by this author and was excited that he wrote a book for young men about growing up... luckily I read it before giving it to my son because I threw it in the trash when I was finished.  I thought it was an excellent book until I got to the sexual experimentation... Although I still think that Michael's books are great resources, he lost a bit of credibility in my opinion.   
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 OK, so most of the reviews I read for this film said how great it was, well I for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing Angelina's breasts.  The acting was poor, the script was stupid, and the sets were lame.  I have seen some pretty bad movies in my time (ie Killer Kondom) but this one took the cake.. I would watch tromavision flicks over this one ANY day.  save your money. If you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week ; 
 Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages 
 The remix is totally devoid of any taste:First the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. Secondly,there is absolutely no respect on part of the "mixing DJs" for the great vocalists:there  is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. I was deeply disappointed with this cd.If you are into remixes get The Rod Stewart "Do ya think i am sexy" single cd instead 
 I took so much time for you to put the order that I cancelled 
 The beginning was quite promising but this excitement soon fizzled out as it moved beyond. By the middle of the book, I was just reading through aimlessly. (I do have a compulsion of having to finish every book I start reading, no matter how good or bad)  By the end, I was thoroughly let down. And oh, the twist at the end was surprising but it could not rescue this wreck 
 This model was intended as a replacement for my not-very-old and yet quite functional Panasonic PM-series stereo.  This is the kind of thing that happens when you browse Amazon while drunk late at night.    Unfortunately, with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality, the Sony is in all respects inferior; ergonomics, appearance, and above all, FM reception, which is laughably poor.  Do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver.  Hiss abounds, several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable, and to top it off, Sony has stuck with their time-honored habit of using proprietary connectors, so when I went to plug in an after-market antenna to get better reception, I found a weird little plug that I hadn't noticed when I put the damned thing together.  Grrr.  So now I'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds.  Death to Sony 
 Lindsay Moran's foray into the publishing world is as unsatisfying as her love life.   First, the positive aspects of the book: Moran really was a case officer in the CIA, at a crucial point in the agency's history (immediately pre and post 9/11). Many of the books now available about the CIA inner-workings were written during the Cold War, and now are obsolete to the modern day reader.  As someone interested in applying to the agency, the book has value in that it prepares one for some of the hardships of Clandestine life. You learn that there are some real downsides to the life of a case officer. You learn how pervasive the agency controls your life. You learn the extent of training.  Lindsay Moran as an author is pompous, over-confident, and border-line delusional. She seems very insecure about many things; her ethnic heritage, her weight, her looks, her personality, and most of all, her marital status. I do not think I've ever come across a writer who so absolutely requires male companionship in order to validate who they are. Moran's incessant references to her "Harvard education" reveal her insecurity about her own intellect; she finds it necessary to constantly remind the reader of her Ivy league education. While she insults other CIA recruits for their desire to succeed, she simultaneously reveals her never-ending attempts to soar to the top of the class. She is the type of person that, on the surface, pretends not to try, and yet spends every waking moment desperately attempting to succeed. Her hypocrisy is sickening.  Moran's writing style is extremely obnoxious. The writing appears as if she sat down in front of a computer with a dictionary and thesarus and attempted to use the most obscure and inappropriate descriptive words possible. Simply put, she is terrible at describing localities, people, and herself.   Her relationship with men is the most disturbing part of all. She constantly launches verbal assaults against the men in her life. At the same time, she never stops whining about how she wants a boyfriend, a husband. Her double standards smack of a weak and conflicted person.  I also suspect that Moran embellished many of her encounters with CIA personnel, in order to make herself appear in a better light.   In my opinion, Lindsay Moran is a terrible author who had no business getting a book published. The only reason she was able to get this book printed was because of her experience at the CIA. And yet she does nothing but trash the very place that makes the book possible. Moran clearly never possessed the strength of will and commitment necessary for a covert operative. I suspect that she took the job because she secretly wanted her family, her friends, and others, to know that she was a CIA case officer, and for them to be endlessly impressed with her job. The CIA requires individuals who are not glory-whores like Moran. She should have never walked through that door.   Overall, read the book if you are thinking about a career as a case officer. In spite of her second-rate writing ability, Moran does provide an insider's view of the agency. However, I would not let Moran's pessimistic attitude and self-righteous, know-it-all demeanor sour you on the agency. Read other books as well in order to balance out this poor excuse for a published work 
 I ordered this magazine as a gift. I paid for it on Nov. 21 '05. It is now Feb. 19 '06, and my daughter has not yet recieved her Christmas present! I will never again place an order with Amazon! Barnes and Noble has proved to be very efficient and worthy of my business. I will at this point try to get my money back from this company, and my daughter can purchase the magazine and all the missed issues off the newsstand 
 This one was made after Disney died, Billy Mummy is too old for the role he plays, and it's often too dark, and it sometimes really drags.  Mummy's scenes--where he's supposed to exhibit deep emotion and sympathy--are as annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard.  Better to buy Charlie the Lonesome Couger, or the one about the Yellowstone Bears or the earlier version of "The Incredible Journey," the one they only have on videotape 
 Unless you have a very small and old TV, don't buy it. The picture quality is very bad, no sharpness, blurred video. I don't know if it was just a dvd production problem affecting few copies or because this concert was recorded in Europe and there were problems in the PALM to NTSC translation, but even in the first case you still have a chance of getting a bad copy 
 When I bought this book, I was looking for info on how to price a photo assignment for sale.  The title and short abstract of the book led me to believe this would be a great reference for my purposes.  However, when I  got the book, the first few paragraphs pointed out that its focus was on  assignment stock photography, not for pricing photo assignments in which  the finished prints are to be sold to individual clients.  If I were  submitting stock photos to publishers, it would be a great reference for  me.  It gets 2 stars only because it didn't suit my purposes at the time 
 Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us 
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 As a brazilian animator I tried to start to read this book by the Latin american section, and comprehensively, by the one that shows the status of animation in my country, Brazil, a reality that I know very well.I don't know where Mr. Bendazzi got his informations for this part of the book.What I know is that it's full of strange or, at least unknown names of people for most of the brazilian animators, illustrators figuring as animators, besides the absence of five or six of the really most important animators in my country.Because of all that,I'm affraid the rest of the book, at least in those sections telling about the animation in Latin America still needs to be revised 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 This loser tries to hide his racism behind witty anecdotes, but it is so clear that he hates other races, nations and cultures and frankly feels that they get what they deserve. Prof. of History???? What a joke! 
 By now we all love Christianity, with its lovable skull-crushing God, deathless Jesus, and the silly angels as well. We especially love the non-fiction accounts such as the flood which arent at all stolen from Eygpitian mythology!!!!!  Well, not everyone likes it! Amy Welborn is just another knee-jerk anti-American, anti-Christian liberal, aint they all, and she hates Christians!!!!!!  Just because the Da Vinci Code PROVES that Jesus existed, married, and had children, one of his long lost sons being the lovable George Bush, she has to criticuze the book!!!!!!   Look if you want ag ood book, you know where to look and thats to books like "PRESIDENT JESUS: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II", "Without Remorse" by the scholarly Tom Clancy, and of course "DA Vinci Code" by Dan Brown, pious God-fearing man that he is 
 First as another reviewer stated the salt to sugar ratios are off. Secondly the book tells you to smoke a brisket at 350 for about 1 hour per pound.  I'm not an expert at smoking by any stretch of the imagination, but I know that brisket needs to be smoked low and slow, otherwise tough brisket and a ruined meal.  I also have a problem with adding liquid smoke to recipes as a couple in this book have, it seems to have a chemical aftertaste.  The game recipes are scant with only one for venison.  I do like the tables in the back for brining and smoking times.  If you want a book that gives a little information on everything with some interesting recipes go ahead and buy it.  If you want a book that teaches you the art of smoking this one isn't for you. 
 I saw the movie and was going to get the original soundtrack, which sounded great on the DVD.  Other reviews indicated that the remix version was much superior, so I bought that version.  What a mistake!  The remix uses a bunch of dime-store, tinny-sounding effects that just ruin the sound in my opinion.  In disgust, I gave up listening after hearing about 6 cuts.  Unless you're into a heavily disco-ized sound and special effects, I'd avoid the remix version like the plague 
 In this book, Mr. Biggs does not discuss the fact that before he left Morgan Stanley he was unmasked as having fabricated comments used in his research reports (claimed to be from his plumber, Ron Valentine) [see NYT, May 21, 2000, Sec 3, p2]. Readers and potential readers of Hedgehogging should, however, remember. It explains the view smart investors have had of Mr. Biggs for some time: he is mildly entertaining, but not someone you should use for serious advice. And above all: never give him any money.  Hedgehogging won't challenge this conclusion for a number of reasons. First, it is about what the author does not say. Nowhere does Mr. Biggs actually detail his hedge fund's strategy or process. His discussion of losses from shorting oil are interesting, but only highlight his lack of thought. Is Mr. Biggs just the public face for Traxis, asking for money for no other reason than he has been around a long time?  It is also about what he does say. Several times Mr. Biggs talks about the "special magic" that it takes to be an investment superstar, most memorably when he talks of the "seeing eye" (p111).  This seems to be his core philosophy. Investment success is not made or created, it just happens to those who succeed.   And it is about his actions. In the end, hedge funds can be judged by only one thing: performance. After initial success with Fairfield Partners, Mr. Biggs does not talk about their returns other than that Fairfield "survived the bear market of the 1970s." He left in 1973. We will all see how Traxis does.  Finally, an attempt to put names to pseudonyms. Most do not precisely match Mr. Biggs' "clues," but many of the details may not be true (remember Ron Valentine). Superstar Ian (p11): J. Kevin Kenny, Jr., Emerging Sovereign Group Grinning Gilbert (p15): Steven Cohen, SAC (fantasy amalgamated with Zalmon Gilbert Simmons) Jock Robinson and Casino Resorts (p35): Robert Wilson and Resorts International Jim the Trigger (p51): Janus alums ala Warren Lammert and Blaine Rollins Peter the Great (p63): Henry Kravis, KKR Tim (p96): Nicolas Roditi The Bearded Prophet of the Apocalypse (p99): Douglas Kass, Seabreeze Julian's Guy (p104): Tiger Cub cocktail with likes of Chase Coleman, Thomas Facciola Dave (p133): David Marvin, Marvin & Palmer Greg from Mega (p192): Leon Cooperman, Omega Judson Thomas and his special Wall Street Journal (ch20):  When first written in 1971, the story was clearly fantasy. But today, it is remarkable how Barton has become Judson. "... a big, beefy middle-aged man, faintly disheveled, his shoes spotted. The face was good - strong, sturdy features arranged honestly - but the eyes had been shot away a long time ago and now there was nobody home a lot of the time... Jud knew all the big names in the game like Kingdon, Cooperman, and Druckenmiller, but they disdained him as a hack." 
 I recently purchased this book to strengthen my momentum skills. Being somewhat new to TA, it is has came easy having a extensive computer background. I found Prings explanation on oscillators complete but lacks  application to daytrading/investing. I met him at a recent show asking him  pertinent questions as they apply to the market and trading and he  replied...."I need to buy another book". This book is good on how  oscillators are made....NOT HOW THEY ARE USED 
 my least favorite simon album.  the writing is forced and inconsistent.  not very good 
 I would have given this book no stars if I could.  My Bible study group and I went through Ransomed Heart and loved it.  I can't believe how disappointing this book is and I would not recommend it.  Mr. Eldredge hides his anger (barely masked), arrogance and deceit in this book.  Do not buy it 
 That's how I view it: a colossal waste of my hard-earned money. It gets two stars for the rather vague instructional effort with the alleged "quick start" guide at the outset of the book and the appendix at the end of the book. That said, onward...  Like a previous reviewer, I have long since become beyond fed up with Scott Kelby's unprofessional humorous digressions (which I don't find particularly humorous at all, to be frank) in his books, which are all  masquerading as professional tutorial/instructional books on the topics. So, I was looking for a good, solid, professional instructional book to accompany my Lightroom 1.0 software program.  I tried to glean some insight from the book's quick start guide, but found that unprofitable, vague and nebulous - as much so as the rest of the book. That Mr. Evening is a high volume professional is not in dispute, that much is abundantly clear. However, as a reasonably competent advanced medium volume product photographer, I simply could not follow along with Mr. Evening in his book sufficiently enough to glean anywhere near a reasonably competent deeper understanding of my Lightroom software.  That Mr. Evening is a pro and an imminently competent one and then some is clear. That he is equally imminently incompetent in conveying his vast professional knowledge as it relates to Adobe's Lightroom software to new LR users is equally clear, at least to me.  Others have already pointed out the rush to print and less-than-efficacious proofreading, which, had it been done, would have purged the book of its Beta LR tome, so I'll leave that and not comment further beyond noting my concurrence on the point.  For me, it was a major waste of money and, unlike another reviewer, I don't even find the appendix makes up for wasted cash outlay for this book.  Help! There HAS to be a forthcoming instructional book on Adobe Lightroom somewhere beyond Kelby's childish, wearying "humor" digressions which consume more of his publications than the excellent morsels of information/instruction he is imminently qualified to dispense (if one wants to waste both one's time AND one's money digging out such morsels) and the inability of Mr. Evening to cogently and clearly communicate his vast professional knowledge of LR and its potential to benefit medium volume users like myself.  My recommendation, FWIW: if you are trying to learn your new LR 1.0 software, don't waste your money on this book. You won't achieve your goal with it 
 Reminds me of one of those baseball books with statistics but not much else.  The stories are short and typically discuss one or two hands at most.  If you want history it may have value but it will not improve your play 
      I emailed Skycaddie "contact us" the day after I bought a SG4 to ask for help.   I have received no response in 3 weeks.  I played today with it for the first time.   A guy I was playing with today also had a SG4.   Neither of us could get a distance reading despite the indicator saying we had a strong GPS signal.   All we got was "999" or complete blanks.  He has played with it four times and said it worked ok twice and didn't work twice.  It looks GREAT on TV. It is a real pity that my unit didn't work today.  I plan on returning it this week 
 I was disappointed.  Make sure you understand that this book is a compilation of a series of articles that appeared from mid-1980 to mid-1990.  Two problems arise: 1) Since each article is brief, there is no depth to the subject matter, and  2) though a valiant attempt was made to organize the articles into logical chapters and categories, the truth-of-the-matter is that the flow of information from one article to another can be disjointed and difficult to follow.  With all due respect, the author points this out in his Introduction, but alas, I had already purchased the book 
 I like every actor/actress in this movie that I know of and I really tried to like it, but if a movie ever needed gratuitous nude scenes this was the one, but alas it had but one short meaningless nude scene performed by a unknown and it was her only scene. Sadly that was one of the films highlights. Now I say that because if it had few nude scenes thrown in here and there then the film would be at least veiwable or have fleeting moments of sophmoric humor ... somewhat. It did have a plot, a very weak, very predicable plot that left no room for surprises or guess work unless perhaps you are a little challenged mentally. The surprise ending was lackluster and overall a very poor effort for those involved. It did have Taylor Negron who as a rule is pretty funny, but I'm guessing the budget on this movie was so low that they couldn't afford to pay him to talk as he played a mute and Matt Winston said all his lines. The scenes with Matt Winston (Gerd) and Taylor Negron (Gunther) offered a few chuckles, but for rest of the cast Jaime Pressly, Brooke Burns, Maria Arcé, Sung Hi Lee and others they seemed painfully out of place. Granted they are very easy on the eyes, but fall far from comedy they are trying so hard to perform. Even the quasi evil Merle played by Diane Delano who you might remember as Officer Barbara Semanski from "Northern Exposure" failed to deliver a quality performance it was for the most part her reviving her role as Semanski.  Overall the movie rambles and roams around never really grabbing your attention or tickling your funny bone. For all of it's effort to be funny it in the end falls to do so. Now for the record, I can handle a bad movie , I can handle really bad movies and I even enjoy them time to time, but somehow I doubt this movie will last long on my bad movie collection for it doesn't make it into the guilty pleasure or midnight movie class of films. Catch it on Comedy Central if you have to see it, it should be there real soon, but don't waste your money on it unless you can rent it for free. The DVD extras are thin and not very funny, the overall transfer and sound is good but not worth the $3.00 I paid for it.    It would seem the reveiwer that said "This Movie ROCKS" has being running around to different review sites, tooting this movies horn, guess they are either in the movie or friends with someone who is, as every other reveiw sight has this film rated at 1 star or less. I know where the "Rocks" are and they are not on the screen but they are in Hollywood 
 I had to buy this book for a philosophy class. I hate it. Trying to learn about a worldview through a third party (Sire) is, at best, fustrating. Sire often sermonizes and is incessently adding his own opinions about whatever. Its really aggravating that it is assumed that the reader can't come up with his/her own opinion on the subject matter. 
 The book starts by bringing you straight into the feeling of despair and alienation Elaine and her husband Paul are experiencing in their suburban life. You feel a vague sympathy for them and wonder, "what must be going on in their lives to make them feel so trapped?"  This question is never really answered. The book spends time expressing this depressing state of being in various satirical situations, but never gets beyond the expression of that feeling, which we get from the first page of the book. She offers no insight on why the characters came to feel the way they do, or what they can do to get out of it. As a character portrait all that is fashioned for the protagonist Elaine is the feeling of helplessness; no other aspects of her psyche or personality are defined. We learn nothing about her thoughts, views on the world, personality, or patterns of thinking that may give us a hint as to why she got that way. The same can be said for Paul.   Their environment gives us few clues as well. They live the typical life of a suburban family. They have good kids, good money, and good friends. Since we have seen this story portrayed in many better books and movies before, we can guess what the problems of their environment are. They feel they have to put up a front of stability and happiness for the people they are around, even their closest friends and family. They feel they are only going through the motions of daily life, and following a set of societal rules.   But, the thing is, their lives aren't any worse than anyone else's; in fact, they live pretty good lives. Anyone in any situation anywhere on the planet could be feeling what the characters are. One gets the sense that the author feels this is the general human condition. What this means for us as a race of people is never explored; instead it's dealt with in sloppy, broad strokes, with an ending too dramatic and serious for the scope of the novel. The aspects of the novel that are meant to be ironic and funny are not creative enough to even be clever. Nor are the things that are meant to be shocking at all original enough to have us surprised. Skip this novel and rent American Beauty. 
 This thing worked like a champ, impressed friends, and lasted all of 6 months...and then, the plastic screw that attaches the handle to the grating drum snapped.  Cheap, Cheap, Cheap! and at $20/per...definately not considered disposable!  Look elsewhere.  The Zyliss will be my next purchase and I will leave feedback. 
 After an amazing season 3 culminated in tragically hopeless catastrophe, I had such high hopes for season 4. Episodes 1 - 6 are dark and interesting, but season 7 is the beginning of the downward spiral. None of the characters are likable or interesting after that point.   The story line was leaden. After growing into a self-less champion for good in season 3, Cordelia acts like a depraved moron until she is revealed to be little more than a body suit for a dark force...except it takes *FAR* too many episodes to reveal this. Much of the final 15 episodes are made up by long, boring, circular talks between Cordelia and Connor (yawn). In the words of Buffy: "Alright! I get it - You're evil!" The blah blah Oedipal/Modred weirdness of the whole season is just not appealing or well-written enough to be intellectually stimulating. Would that Cordelia had never come back for season 4, because it's just too awful that her sassy-yet-big-hearted self was nowhere to be found.  Connor and the Cordy-suit have a baby - a goddess figure named Jasmine...who is kind of like a cross between LaFawnda from Napoleon Dynamite and a New Age yoga instructor. A full five episodes are filled with long, dull scenes of people being adoring acolytes of this unimpressive villain. Connor's character doesn't develop...period. Sorry folks, but he doesn't get gone until the final scene of the final episode. In a word, blah.   Some good stuff: The gang releases Angelus for interrogation purposes and he goes postal, of course. It's well-played by Boreanaz and highly entertaining (Oh, and Angel's hair is slightly shorter and darker, which is a nice change). Faith returns for a few episodes, the best of which is Orpheus. Faith and Angelus share flashbacks of Angel's good deeds ("Dude, you just saved a puppy!"), while guest star Willow works to restore Angel's soul and give guidance to floundering Wesley. 
 I found this book to be lacking.  In character development, plot, etc.  It just never really went anywhere - not that it needed to but it just didn't grab me as her other novels have.  I found it to be very underdeveloped.  Perhaps, as one other reviewer wrote, this was before she hit her stride?  That's what I think 
 I thoroughly enjoyed previous entries in the "Cat Who..." series, but this one was very disappointing.  In fact, I was so disappointed in this one that I pulled out a couple of older ones to see if my tastes had simply changed!  No, the book just doesn't measure up.  As another viewer commented - too cutesy, too predictable, too little mystery.  I will look for subsequent titles at the library rather than purchase them in hardback.  I hope this is just an oddball flop 
 The author is obviously an expert in this field, but his book is very difficult to wade through, even for someone well-versed in finance.  I had the same issue with the "Body of Knowledge" books. If all you do for a living is valuation, you might appreciate these tombs, but for practical use, one I like more is "Unlocking the Value of Your Business".  
 This is the first Rosalind Miles book I have read, and I am not moved to read another. The language was so very hokey that it was painful to read at times. The book was filled with dull characters, cliche descriptions, and overly dramatic scenes like a B movie script. I was very disappointed 
 I know I'd be stressed out if I was him. Don't put on too much weight Shawn. Take your Cortislim !!!  http://consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/ftc_cortislim.html Cortislim Promoters Forfeit $4.5 Million in FTC Settlement September 21, 2005  Three defendants will forfeit $4.5 million in cash and other assets to settle Federal Trade Commission charges stemming from their roles in the marketing of CortiSlim and CortiStress, dietary supplements promoted for weight loss and disease prevention    In its complaint, the FTC alleged that the defendants made false or unsubstantiated product claims and used deceptively formatted infomercials in pitching the dietary supplements.  The surrendered assets will include an investment partnership and related charitable foundation, a speedboat, a truck, and a variety of real estate interests. As part of the settlement, the defendants cannot seek a cash refund of state or federal taxes for 2003, 2004, or 2005 that were paid prior to the settlement.  The FTC alleges that advertising claims about CortiSlim's ability to, among other things, cause rapid, substantial, and permanent weight loss in all users were false or unsubstantiated, as were claims about CortiStress's ability to reduce the risk of, or prevent, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.  The FTC also alleges that CortiSlim and CortiStress infomercials were deceptively formatted to appear as talk shows rather than advertisements. The advertising campaign for CortiSlim ran nationwide, including ads on broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, and the Internet.  The defendants in the settlement announced today, California-based Pinnacle Marketing Concepts, Inc. and its president, Thomas F. Cheng, and Utah-based Shawn M. Talbott, cannot make benefit or efficacy claims for any dietary supplement, food, drug, cosmetic, or device unless the claims are truthful and substantiated. Litigation continues against the four defendants who have not settled.  In September 2004, the Commission filed a complaint against Window Rock Enterprises, Inc.; Stephen F. Cheng; Infinity Advertising, Inc.; Gregory S. Cynaumon; and Shawn M. Talbott. The Commission later amended its complaint to add Pinnacle and Thomas F. Cheng as additional defendants.  The FTC announced two separate stipulated final agreements and orders for permanent injunction today, one with Pinnacle and its president, Thomas Cheng, who the FTC alleges participated in the marketing of Cortislim and CortiStress; and one with Talbott, who the FTC alleges formulated the two products and participated in the advertising.  Both orders prohibit the making of certain claims about CortiSlim and CortiStress and require competent and reliable scientific evidence to support any other claims made about the products.  The orders also bar misrepresentations of any tests or studies and prohibit claims about the performance, effects on weight, or other health benefits of any dietary supplement, food, drug, cosmetic, or device unless the claims are true, not misleading, and substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Finally, both orders prohibit the use of deceptively formatted television and radio advertisements and require the use of "paid advertisement" disclosures for television ads longer than 15 minutes and for radio ads longer than five minutes.  The settlement with Pinnacle and Thomas Cheng requires them to give up $3.4 million in assets: $700,000 cash; the net proceeds from an investment partnership and related charitable foundation; a $215,000 boat; a $40,000 truck; and a $450,000 property lien. If they are later found to have misrepresented their financial status, the two defendants would be liable for a $23.8 million judgment.  The settlement with Talbott requires him to give up $1.12 million in assets: $225,000 cash; $350,000 from equity in property in Centerville, Massachusetts, or title to the property; $38,700 from the sale of a timeshare in Hawaii or title to the timeshare; and cash equal to 80 percent of the current market value of a property in Lisbon, Ohio, or title to the property. If Talbott is later found to have misrepresented his financial status, he would be liable for a $3.5 million judgment.  Under the agreements, the defendants also assign to the FTC all claims they might have against the other defendants in this case, and they will not use their settlement with the Commission as a basis for seeking a cash refund of income taxes that they reported as paid. In addition, the agreements include standard record-keeping provisions and require the defendants to distribute copies of the orders to certain entities and individuals.  
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 I remember watching the NBC Mystery Movie in the 70s. I remember the theme music (not on the DVD, by the way) for the series and the guy with the flashlight...just like everyone else who grew up with tv in the 70s. I really looked forward to the release of McMillan and Wife and McCloud, especially since I hadn't seen many episodes since my childhood. The script-writing is awful. The plots are lousy. The jokes are lame, the arguing with the Chief forced, the love-making with Chris ridiculous! Not enough Terry Carter, either. The guest stars (except Julie Sommars) are given almost nothing to do! I am desperately waiting for December 6th and the release of season one of The Rockford Files. I've seen that show often through the years and it combined great acting, writing, and story-telling. Sometimes nostalgia stinks. 
 I purchased both this title and "The Insider's Guide to Real Estate Investing Loopholes" (same authors).  I have two primary complaints.  The authors talk down to the reader, constantly making snarky comments that imply that if one doesn't act NOW, the reader is lazy, or paralyzed, or is somehow inept when it comes to business.  That's not just annoying -- it's weird, and it made me suspicious of the authors' motives.  That brings me to my second complaint.  The book lacks balance.  I'm not saying that all of the strategies can't work -- just that it requires an ideal set of market conditions for them to work.  We need to see low or declining interest rates, quickly rising tenant incomes, improving neighborhoods, distressed or at least disinterested sellers, few other investors, low insurance costs, and a plethora of service providers (such as roofers) who do great work at a low price very quickly.  I can tell you that we don't have any of those factors at work now.  What we do have, at least in areas like mine, where appreciation has outpaced incomes, is a market turned on its head.  Sellers will not sell because they are sitting on huge profits for the most part, and don't have to sell.  Or, they believe that prices will appreciate at the same ridiculous rate that they did from 2001-2005.  Numerous Dolf-inspired investors have flooded the market and bid prices up beyond all reason.  Workers are in debt and don't have much money for rent.  Neighborhoods where deals are affordable aren't improving, so the idea of refinancing because you painted and put up a new mailbox won't help you.  Easy mortgage money has gotten anyone with a pulse into homes.  Interest rates are rising, not falling.  Insurance is costly and the coverage stinks.  And most importantly, rents do not provide positive cash flow for most small real estate investors.  I know several who actually consider themselves to be successful and the news is not good.  They are carrying their properties, their properties are not carrying them!  I know, it's hard to believe that this is success.  But in the past few years, appreciation has bailed them out.  Put that kind of leverage into effect and you are leveraging a negative, which only means you go broke faster.  A few observations:  First, if making untold riches were this simple and this obvious, then so many people would attempt to do so that it would suck the potential profit from such deals down until the actual profit is more equivalent to the amount of work involved.  (More about this in a moment -- because I believe that this is actually occuring in part due to all of the real estate evangelism going on.)  As they say on Wall Street:  "When enough people find the key to the market, someone changes the lock!"  I believe that most people reading this review are smart enough to know that markets are dynamic.  Outrageous profits bring in a flood of new entrants, dramatically reducing the profit potential.  If a whole bunch of new wannabe real estate tycoons start lining up to bid on properties, then the prices for those properties will rise, as will the price for the money (the financing charges in the form of interest rates).  Even without a lot of new entrants, if enough people start using the same financial techniques of leverage, cost-benefit analysis, or tax strategies, then the advantages to be gained will be reduced commensurately.  Common sense and basic real-world economics dictate that costs will rise and potential profits will fall.  And so it is in the real estate world.  Economies of scale and technological advancements have changed many industries and wiped out others.  The ability for a small business person to get a competitive bid on anything is severely limited, whether you are talking about insurance, waste collection, land, communication services, landscaping, or anything else.  Big players have the advantage in negotiations and will consistently be able to lower their costs below that a single investor.  They can offer their tenants more amenities and constantly remodel and update their units at a far lower cost than you or me.  I can't start a profitable shipbuilding company or TV network, nor can I jump into owning large buidings over which I can spread my costs enough to justify what is increasingly becoming break-even or negative cash flow from tenants.  I am not saying that there will never again be opportunities for small real estate investors to use leverage and tax advantages to make decent money.  Just that, with so many of your fellow investors looking to do the same thing, you are not going to find (DEEP BREATH HERE!): underpriced positive cash-flowing properties in undervalued neighborhoods with great potential on which you can quickly close at a dynamite interest rate that result in quickly-rented units with stable, high-earning tenants who are happy to stick around so you can quickly refinance at "massively increased property valuation" (Dolf's expression) so you can pay yourself and your investors back, raise rents even higher and go on to the next property with similar ideal parameters, plunk 10% down and do the same thing.  And no, I'm not an unmotivated individual who works harder than I have to, doesn't understand the value of money, or doesn't want financial freedom.  We all want that.  In Dolf's world, there are numerous individuals who can't wait to to sell you $100 for $50.  My question is, if he knows how to get people to do that, why he is telling us about it?  I think we all know the answer to this question.  Don't get me wrong:  Eventually, the property marketplace will right itself and investment properties will come up that offer opportunity to even small investors, even with the odds stacked against you.  However, it won't unlock some kind of magical door to riches.  It will simply be one of many investments that helps you build LONG-TERM wealth.  Real estate is just another business that goes through cycles and isn't necessarily any more of a path to fabulous riches than owning a chain of gas stations or making molded plastic products.  By the way, the most successful real estate investment firms in America have had a total return about 23% annually for the past five years through March 31, 2006.  That includes dividends and share price appreciation.  If that's the BEST they can do, (and I'm not saying it's bad...it's actually an amazing performance!), it's  because that's the BEST anyone can hope to do, including you and me.  Remember, these firms use all the leverage they can muster and have tremendous economies of scale, and the smartest tax accountants and attorneys working on their behalf.  We are highly unlikely to see this performance repeated in real estate for the next five years or possibly, ever.  Footnote:  I recently studied single family homes in Broward County and Palm Beach County, Florida.  Over the past thirty-five years, not including taxes of any kind, residential properties have enjoyed an average annual return of 9.25% per year.  Short-run performance tends to regress towards the mean.  Therefore, we are virtually assured that real estate will come nowhere close to its recent performance over the next several years, particularly in a higher-interest rate environment with lots of new supply.  Buyer beware 
 This may be a very essential book for hard core cooks who have a lot of money to buy the grocery's needed. I read it and made one recipe from it. The book has been sitting on my shelf ever sence. There are many other, books out there that are better then this one 
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 I've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped, so the crown no longer locks in place. I've tried contacting Citizen for waranty and they say it's not covered. Citizen claims that I over tightened it or cross-threaded it while screwing down, so it will cost $50-100 to repair.   TOTAL JOKE! I'll never purchase a Citizen watch again. I've always thought they were cheap to begin with. This just confirms my thoughts 
 I was expecting this to be a book about the monastic experience, but instead, it is a book mostly about Kathleen Norris, her life, and her social theories. There are a few nuggets of wisdom sprinkled here and there, but not enough to justify reading all the surrounding dross. Worse, there is no humility in the book at all.   Instead of being a seeker of wisdom who went into religion and then wrote about her experience, Norris seems to be merely a writer with a gimmick of hanging out with monks and nuns to get a good book idea. If you like that sort of thing, you may like this book, but you should know what you're getting before you buy it.  There is a hard edge to Norris's writing, an underlying anger and vulgarity. For example: "[N]ow we sigh, discouraged, hearing only the seeds of our well-worn, ludicrous sexual double standard which dictates that women must be either virgins or whores, either blessed or cursed, while men are simply sexual athletes." And: "That we all begin inside a woman and must emerge from her body is something that the male theologians of the world's religions have yet to forgive us for."   She uses the f-word, apparently just to shock readers and listeners, as when she notes with self-congratulatory satisfaction that after one such use her driver appeared startled because "[S]he apparently had heard that I was a religious writer." Well, regrettably, I had heard that, too.   There is far too little introspection in this book. Norris too easily criticizes others while failing to look at herself and while rationalizing her own behavior. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading Henri Nouwen, who seemed to always analyze the nature of his own feelings instead of criticizing someone else who may have brought those feelings about. But then again, Nouwen was a person of admirable humility, a quality Norris needs to work hard to develop.  Norris has plenty of personal issues to deal with, as do we all. This book would have been much better if she had spent more time honestly wrestling with these issues instead of commenting on externals, offering social criticism and justifying her life as "a poet. 
 Do Not buy this DVD if you are an average movie goer. Maybe it could be for the advanced screenwriter who might be able to understand any of this cr@p but any normal person sure will not 
 VERY, VERY, WEIRD fit. Too short, too wide, tiny ankles, very big and loose above ankle 
 The description for this cartridge says that it "provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria" with its "Aquastat" antimicrobial technology.  If you read the literature that comes with it, however, it says that it prevents microbe growth *in the cartridge*.  Not in your humidifier.  It's not an antimicrobial cartridge; it's a demineralization cartridge.  Whoever reported that it removes slime must be imagining it 
 Let me start by saying I've never listened to Steamroller before picking this up. I am a big fan of Halloween and have quite a collection of music/sound fx so naturally, this was a must buy when I saw it. Strictly from a Halloween fan's point of view, I can't recommend this except maybe for a kids party. The synth on the tracks really removes any spookiness from the tunes and makes them fall short of Halloween-worthiness. Tocatta and Hall of the Mountain King are some of my absolute favorite classical pieces and here they are given a royal treatment...if they were produced on a Commodore 64, or Casio keyboard for you younger folk. The FX disc isn't horrible, but it's below the average generic sound fx you find in the bargain bin. Again, not much scary  except for the fact that I spent money on this. If possible, check it out before you buy 
 One of these days the YA publishers will stop using actual YA writers for their tomes. Sure, the young adults are the same age as the readers, but that means nothing when character development and insight are sacrificed.  This book is about a nerd creepy loser whose given a nanocomputer to train him to be cool. So he becomes a jackass creepy loser. Most of the supporting characters are types and the non-teenage characters are either boring or ridiculous. There's even some homophobia thrown in as the English teacher swishes every which way saying MAAAAAAAAAA (I'm not sure what that means either).   While the book centers on the narrator's attempt to go out with a girl in his drama club, you never get why he likes her. In fact, she never seems to be a coherent human being. Almost every time she's in the narrative she's doing something off-kilter that makes no sense to anyone. The only reason why you sympathize with her is because she's got to deal with this jerk, and even then you really wish she'd just put a restraining order on him.  While there are moments of insight, where the author and the narrator come up against the fact that they aren't the only people in the world with problems, they are few and far between.  Overall, this is a horrible book with horrible characters and lousy plotting. The only good thing that you can say for the book is that it's not half as irritating as the audio CD 
 When I read an autobiography, I like to feel I have come to know and to have enjoyed meeting the author.  What did I learn from "Include Me Out?  Nothing very much other than (1) apparently Mr. Granger has not had a meal that he has forgotten!  You have to search far and wide to find a page on which food and/or drink are not mentioned. (2) He must have a problem with short-term memory, since he keeps repeating himself in this slender volume.  For example, he tells a story about Richard Rogers and a deleted song from "Babes In Arms" on page 99 and then repeates the same story on page 205; ditto with a story of Peggy Guggenheim's bequest stipulation that her art collection remain in the city of Venice which first appears on page 148 and then again on page 170. (3) His relationships seem superficial: Although he states "I fell in love with Janice [Rule]...and before long we were making wedding plans."  Only four  lines later "it was time to move on with our lives and careers, not with married life."  Most of his affairs with women seem to be "one night stands" and although an article in the 3/27/07 issue of THE ADVOCATE states that "he has been happily partnered with TV producer Robert Calhoun...for the past 45 years", Farley Granger never identifies himself as gay or describes his relationship to Robert Calhoun [co-author of INCLUDE ME OUT] with any passion.  In fact, he leaves the reader with the impression that they are neighbors rather than lovers.  Nowhere in the book does he talk about pursuing anyone sexually.  Passively, life happens to him, instead. (4) Some of the things he writes about just don't make sense.  For example, he describes a restaurant (food again!)  in Venice where the gondoliers hung out: "It was for men only...At some point in the evening, different men or groups of men would spontaneously sing opera." (p. 158)..."The singing went on for at least ninety blissful minutes, with duests, solos, quartets, and sextests from Italian operas being sung..."(p.159)  Now I ask: What Italian operas have quartets and sextets sung only by men?  Mr. Granger lucked-out in being cast in a few--very few--excellent films, but he did not impress me as having any real depth as an actor, and, on the basis of this autobiography, even less so as an author. It is superficaial, banal, boring, and at times even annoying.  Save your money.  If you're curious to see if it is as bad as I think it is, borrow it from your library. 
 I was enjoying this book right up until the author felt the need to make this nutty comparison to Brazilians always being late:   "There is a practice in many Arab cultures whereby a young woman who is caught being intimate with a man she is not married to is sometimes murdered by her brothers. To Westerners, this is uncivilized behavior. But the brother is committed to protecting the role of an important institution-the family-in the social pattern. The temporal behavior of important Brazilians must, similarly , be understood as part of a larger pattern."  Okay Mr. Levine. There are healthy doses of cultural relativism and and then there is, like, femicide. I love it when academics make these kinds of statements, declaring, essentially, that their brainy assertions are more important than people's (and usually women's) lives.  I mean, he has to use the Arab males murdering female kin example because that really helps him make his point; lets him show how impartial he is.  But this reveals the flaw that runs through the entire book. Other than a brief chapter on how power is asserted through making others wait, Levine barely touches on the issue of power, and thus,he can conveniently ignore the female question in all of his observations of other cultures and use murdered women as a prop to support his anthropology-lite observations of tardy Brazilians.  Levine's assertions about Japan are so horrifically and stupidly misguided as to be completely irrelevant. It is obvious that he saw and understood little of the country from his descriptions of stays in nice hotels, visits to tea houses, hot springs, and nightly bottles of Sapporo. Having lived in Tokyo for 13 years I can say that his observations are utterly ridiculous and shallow.     He merely parrots whatever he's been told by the propaganda machine that works keeps everyone in their place there. Among the assertions made by Levine are these tired old gems.   Japanese people don't like taking holidays. Japanese people aren't suffering when their lives and relationships are destroyed, or just never allowed to grow, due to ridiculously long work hours. Japanese people are the exception to the rule. All other people on earth are unhappy when their time and lives are  wasted for the corporation, but Japanese people are somehow "special" and therefore we should let the corporate machine go ahead and keep them miserable. His ludicrous section on Japanese meetings is so off the mark,he may as well have been basing his observations on the Orange County tennis club. He asserts that while Japanese meetings do take a ridiculous amount of time...  It's okay for people to get up and leave the meeting (no one will hold it against them, he writes). People can fall asleep in the meeting. People can get up and get a cup of coffee during the meeting.    I don't know how many of these meetings Mr. Levine has suffered through, but obviously not many-he was too busy going to "tea shops" and "sitting next to Buddhas"-but having suffered through so many of those meetings myself, having watched my friends in Japan suffer (without getting coffee or falling asleep I might add) from wasted hours of life gone to deciding the color of buttons on a school uniform, or the wording of a table of contents, I can safely shake my head at this garbage.  What is most interesting though, is that Levine, admits to his minder. Instead of trusting his own observations here, Levine admits that like a good little honorary member of the Chrysanthemum Club he's allowed his minders to tamper with the truth:"Yoneda wrote because he was concerned (with good reason I might add) about the superficiality of my understanding of Japanese attitudes toward time." And isn't that what always happens when someone who doesn't know the system is close to saying something less than flattering about Japan. Wasn't the Dutch government, after all, told to stop Karel Van Wolferen from speaking his mind? Levine's chapter on Japan is proof of business as usual.  While some of this book was interesting, it really shows how far off the mark some of these scholars, who either have a vested interest in asserting their own versions of foreign cultures, or the versions given to them by those who pay for their plane tickets and hotel rooms, are from   accurate observations of the places they explore 
 I recently took a trip to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, and one of the books I took with me was the Insider's Guide.  I was disappointed to find that it was the most frustrating guide book that I have ever used.  It is so poorly organized! Having the information separated into so many different sections makes it impossible to find anything.  For example, I have a son and so I looked at the Kidstuff chapter.  It's organized like an alphabet book - which is cute to read but impossible to use.  Please re-organize this book - or at least re-do the index.  I would like to be able to go to one chapter and find everything in a particular area, not have to read most of the book to find out what's going on in one area. I do think the book is interesting if you have time to sit and read through the whole thing, but I found it very difficult to find things in it.  
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 Although this book does aim at covering all the options with dealing with the pain of labor, most of the options presented seem ineffective and / or unrealistic -- leaving the only "true" form of pain relief to be  medication, which is my goal to avoid.  Lots of stuffing, no meat 
 As the 1st Lieutenant who led Mr. Garcia's supposed platoon,  1967-68, I would like to point out that none of the incidents he describes, coincide with the experience of any other members of the platoon, or after-action reports of operations.  In fact, no one, including myself, can remember having served on the line with him, and we were a close-knit group.  It is a work of fiction, not the facts, and should be seen as such. For those unsung heroes of the 3rd platoon of B company, who really did bear the burden of some of the bloodiest battles of that war, it is shameful that this man is attempting to profit from his fictitous heroism.  As has been documented in  Stolen Valor, all men who served, wished to be seen as heroic and brave, and many who were not, later, falsely claimed to have to have been Audie Murphy.  I think this phoney hero owes the "real" members of the 3rd platoon, an apology and should pull his book from the shelves.  Hopefully Amazon will do it for him for perpetuating his false "non-fiction"  DAVID BELDING, CAPTAIN,US ARMY RETIRED 
 So, there's some nice stories about Funakoshi and his masters, all with some kind of morality in them. Well, not that bad. Than there's the presentation of Ten No Kata. So, that's interesting because this Kata is  not practiced anymore formally in the JKA and few karatekas even know it  exists, and personnaly I think it's a great method of training basics. So  at least the book shows this kata, but the performer has (seems to me) a  very weak technique compared to the performer in karate-do kyohan the  master's text (see this title). Sometimes the postures and techniques seem  to be shocking for modern shotokan standards. Maybe it has to do with the  evolution of shotokan since the book was written, but then again the  performer in kyohan looks much more the way we are used to for modern  shotokan karate-Do. All in all, I was a bit disappointed with this book. I  give it 2 stars for the Ten No Kata and maybe a little nit for the stories 
 Here's another Italian cannibal movie and I continue to find there isn't much exciting about this genre.  Again, we have mostly controversy over killing animals which I really don't find either disturbing or entertaining at all.  I am also a little bored at seeing Kerman in another movie.    There really was one scene where they could have taken the movie 'too far' but they held back.  I was hoping they would take things too far.  
 now mabye this is not fair because i do not usually like realistic books but this book was boring. I hade to read this book for school and I was bored. It's about a young boy named Fu growing up and having a hard life in  China. I would not recomend this book unless really like realistic books  and ones that are slow. Did I mention the chapters were long 
 The manual mainly covers the earlier years. Later models are more mentioned 
 We checked this out from the library a couple of years ago.  It really was torture to watch.  The acting was terrible, the costumes were even worse.  I don't know whether to say it was really funny or really sad, because all in all it was a pretty pathetic production.  Not one of BBC's better efforts 
 This book offers far less than it promises. Mostly the author hands out platitudes, then tells us how _she_ does everything and how perfect that is. She name-drops continually. Eventually the whole exercise gets so annoying you will want to throw the book, and perhaps the author too, out the window.         
    Just as in his book on Orson Welles, Thomson harbors an untoward lust to "get into the act" himself.  He is forever flapping his arms in front of the projector to throw his own shadow up upon the screen.      He apparently fancies himself a philosopher, so we are never far from some pompous pronunciamento:   "In America we treasure shared things, as if we had a constant fear of being helplessly divided and scattered."  "Here, by the way, is a profound contradiction in much of Americana..."etc     He is, unsurprisingly, cavalier enough about facts to expect to be allowed to breeze by with "To be quick about this part of it, the campaign of the House Committee on Un-American Activities was unconstitutional, and in its punishment, the blacklist, it was illegal."    HUAC's "campaign" itself sadly passed muster via  Congress' power to investigate just about anything it wishes to waste time on, or grandstand about.  It was the methods that offended. HUAC "punishment" was indictment for contempt of congress. The judiciary did the rest on that score, dutifully seeing several into the slam. The blacklist was exclusively the illegitimate get of The (frightened) Studios.     Worst of all about this book is that, whenever he runs out of cheap, scurrilous, time-hallowed, dirt to re-publish, Thomson concocts bitchy dish "nouveau" of his own to serve up 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
      It starts out with this Mexican family illegally coming across the border into the United States. When they get to the U.S., they go to a labor camp in California. This first labor camp is probably the best one that they go to. The whole book is about this family moving around to different labor camps during different crop seasons. Every now and then, Francisco and his brother Roberto go to school. Along the way there are more people added to the family. The book doesn't really come to a good ending. It is also kind of hard to understand because it jumps three years into the future at times and then you don't know what's going on. 	This was a very good book at some times but most of the time the author put in way too many unnecessary details that make the book kind of boring. This book is exactly like it's sequel, Breaking Through. I would rate this book pretty low if like a lot of action.  
 This is more of a pamphlet than a book. It is very small and does not contain much for the BBQ'er unless you are a complete novice. Most of the sauce recipes are not "from scratch". They have you adding things to store bought sauces. There are much better books for yo 
 Hi, I am 7 years old.  This was pretty easy to put together, but VERY hard to keep together.  It breaks if I try to pick it up even if I'm being really careful.  I think I will glue this stinkin' thing 
 The answer is:  he didn't accomplish anything.  This book is a desparate attempt to make Reagan look like an "intellectual".  In one essay, Reagan bemoans the constraints on DDT and other pesticides, insisting there's "no threat to animal, bird or marine life".  Really?  Since when did Reagan have any scientific background to evaluate scientific studies about pesticides?  Of course, Reagan had no scientific basis for this statement--it was just another thing he made up.  Ronald Reagan often cited a Chicago "Welfare Queen" who had ripped off $150,000 from the government, using 80 aliases, 30 addresses, a dozen social security cards, and four fictional dead husbands.   The only trouble is--this Welfare Queen never actually existed.  Reagan made it up.  The followers of Reagan turn him into a fetish.  He was actually a stupid man who said many stupid things which are not true (commonly called "lies").  Conservatives apparently think that someone who lies is a "great" man--but only if the liar is a Republican.  Reagan was a Republican Liar, who lied hundreds of times.  This book does very little to establish Reagan as a "thinker", rather than a senile, stupid man with hate-based ideology 
 my review is written here only for seekers of obscure nine inch nails songs. for a full review of the soundtrack in its entirety read elsewhere-there are many other reviews. i have all 19 halos, and exclusive and unreleased remixes and demos, and i love all of it, including the entirety of the fragile, fixed, perfect drug versions, still, further down the spiral v1 and v2, the deluxe edition of the downward spiral, on and on, everything.... except deep. deep is truly the only nine inch nails song not worth having. painfully uninspired and recycled, musically, lyrically, and visually (the video was an embarassment- again, the only one in a catalogue of otherwise disturbing, beautiful brilliance), DEEP is a song and phase trent himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely. my advice: take it as a mark that he is, after all, human, but leave it here on the tomb raider soundtrack, unpaid for, for it will never show up on an official halo as burn (originally for natural born killers), dead souls (joy division cover originally for the crow), and the perfect drug (originally for lost highway) all have in time (the former two on halo 8 DE and the latter on halos 11, 12, and 15 in extended form) 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 From a military viewpoint, this story is not even close to believable. From a liturature viewpoint, this book has simple sentence structure, simple character development, and very basic dialog.  This novel seams to  have been thought of and written on a weekend holiday.  Previous reviews  mentioned this book as a freshman level read and that is a good description  of the subject content 
 I was gifted a pair of these and had to return them after 2 weeks. I wore them only inside my house just to keep my feet warm. I should have known because when I first smelled them after opening the package, the smell had a chemical hint to it. After a week, the smell on the outside material was horrible. I had them next to my bed and the fumes were so bad I had to move them into another room. I know it's not my feet as I've never had a problem with shoe odor before, and anyway the odor was from the outside materials. YUCK!  
 Alright....sounds like every other emo-rock band that's out there today, EXCEPT they have a female vocalist that makes Karoke Night seem appealing.  She sings like a 4th grader in the school chorus....Sing louder than all your friends so your mom can hear you is MUCH cooler than actually singing well.  Buy this album if you need a good ear-bleeding.  It is a shame because the rest of the band has a decent sound, then they let her sing the courus and your brain melts out of your ears all over your new shirt.  So what it comes down to is that you just bought a CD that you are not physically capable of ever listening to again, and you gotta buy a new shirt.  Do the math 
 Well, the author definitely spent a lot of time researching this book. That is obvious. I really thought this would be another Bonfire of the Vanities type of book about the rick and famous and their habits, lifestyle etc.  I am half way through the bookand I've had enough. There are about 5 paragraphs about each tenant that ever lived in 740 Park.This book is almost like a school textbook with a little history of this and that person except this book is about an apartment building. Not enough information on each tenant for me to develop an interest in the subject, just enough information on who lived in which apartment during which years.   The book started off well enough but after awhile, I lost complete interest in the history of each unit and who lived there, etc. I actually can not remember half the people who subleased, leased or bought the apartments after awhile.   Great attempt. The writer, as I mentioned, definitely did a through research on the history of this building and is obviously a gifted writer. However, a short and brief background information on each tenant failed to draw me in. I would recommend this book to anyone who is doing research in real estate in NY, but would not recommend this book for just reading for enjoyment. 
 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 Bil Keane is an insensitive megalomaniac. The children in "A family circus" are obviouly autistic or suffer some other sort of terrible mental affliction. And yet this "man" mocks their shortcomings. There is a special place in hell for Bil Keane 
 The evidence the book provides does not convince me as to the natural superiority of women, or even their equality.  This is despite the fact of my feelings which are women are equal if not superior 
  Strengths:handful of decent tracks, talent is present, cd has clean sounding guitars, vocals and bass drums, every now and then it almost gets exciting...for a few seconds  Weaknesses: they don't seem to know how to change their sound at all, almost no creativity, music is boring and not energetic at all, most tracks are long and exhausting to listen to, could have been much better than what it is    I'm surprised who P.U. is categorized with. Noone else thinks they sound a tad bit akin to TOOL?  I could be wrong...all I've heard from TOOL in forever is their radio stuff, but this sounds alot more TOOL-ish to me than, oh say, Taproot-ish or Endo-ish.  Hard 'n Heavy bass chords, clearly distinctive guitar rhythms and pounding bass drums, that sound just like TOOL. Vocals have that high pitch sound thats too one keyed and too soft for me. All songs seem to run at virtually one pace..SLOW. The music gets boring.   I can't hear where they've broken any real ground or added anything cool, catchy, or different.  I'm just not digging this disc as much as I think I should be.     With a cheap boombox you're likely to miss alot of the low end that makes the music strong and enticing.  So without good speakers, the music sounds even more wimpy and even more boring than with a good surround system.  
 I really wish this book did not have so many grammatical errors because I believe people need to simplify their life, but this book insults the reader's intelligence.  If a well-respected author like Jack Trout is going to attach his name to a piece of writing he should make sure it is readable.  In addition, this book seems to be choppy in its central theme.  I do not remember the authors addressing the idea of simplicity throughout the whole book.  The central concept was lost somewhere among Jack Trout's tirades to the business professional. 
 A great idea in that when I play I want to know the visual as well as geograhical hazzards. Some interesting information about what RJones does with his courses, but no real mention of anybody else.  I would have liked something to the effect of "Nicklaus guards the gree with...that  forces...type of shot...." In the end I learned some things, but  definitely not $ worth 
 I am schooled in the age appropriateness of literature and film as an educator and now a mom. I know what my child can grasp cognitavely and emotionally, and this one just did not sit well with me at all. I hadn't read any reviews and when my 2+ year old daughter had started to collect care bears as I did at her age, I saw this movie and decided to buy it. This movie is the reason I now read reviews on movies before I buy them for my precious children! I think I had seen this movie as a child but I did not not recall just how scary this movie is for very young children.  My daughter watched it and told me she didn't like the "evil spirit" that is the actual name of the evil character in the movie. I would fast forward through those scenes- but the scary scenes actually make up most of the movie! I hid the movie from her after I saw what it was doing to her. My child had bad dreams and wouldn't sleep for weeks. I gave the movie to her older girl cousins who said they wanted it, but I feel bad because I know it is a horrible movie for any audience. It would have been best for preschoolers to have left the creepy villains out and kept only the care bears and cousins in a care free adventure. Not the case with this one folks! The real reason we bought the movie was to see the lovable care bears. If your kids love care bears do NOT buy this movie or they will soon become their least favorite toys- even scare bears.  Trust me, it is just that bad!!If you are looking for a cutesy care bear movie-a good new one is The Care Bears Big Wish movie- my daughter enjoys that one now 
 Mars and Venus Together Forever is one of the most ridiculous, stupid books that I have ever had the gross misfortune to read.  I probably should have expected what I got, considering that Mars and Venus on a Date left me cold, but I read this one anyway because the original Mars and Venus book had SOME interesting insights and I'm a sucker for a cheap book.  Anyone who buys into the stereotypes promoted by John Gray must be barmy.  He exaggerates, overemphasises and blusters his way through the 200+ pages - probably with the best motives in his mind - but in the end the stuff he writes is uninspiring and insipid.  According to him men and women are still ruled by `ancient' traditions which dictate that women are all do-gooder types who only desire to stay at home, chatting with other women and looking at flowers whilst men are all aggressive cavemen, grunting their way through their lives with zero finesse, a beer in one hand and the TV remote in the other.  I don't see how anyone, man or woman, could read this book without being annoyed.  For women, the book is terribly unempowering.  If you don't fit in with any of Gray's ideas about what a woman should be then you are labelled as masculine.  I don't want to read a book which tells me that when I am at work I am moving towards my masculine side because being goal-oriented, competitive and efficient are male traits.  It's all phooey!  For men, the book is also offensive.  John Gray says that men shouldn't express their feelings because it will cause a woman to lose her attraction for him.  No, I don't believe that men and women are the same in all respects - there are gender differences - but in Mars and Venus these are distorted.  Overall this book is not worth your time.  Underneath the waffle there may be some good points, but all of these are outweighed by the stereotypes.  JoAnn 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 This is the most sexist book I have ever read. Women are portrayed as an object for men to play with. It stereotypes men as horny pigs that use women including their spouse only for sex. This book stereotypes the fact that women are not as sexual as men and have to be convinced by her spouse to have sex with him and another woman. This book is not ment for anyone intending to have sex including one woman and two men. In the event that one woman has sex with two men, the scenario includes all three people being drunk, and the woman who was instigating it all claims that the two men took advantage of her. If this book could be rated less than one star then I would have done so 
 I started this book the same way I started almost every Marquez book in the past - expecting to be mesmerized and taken away for a while from my world to one of the magical-real worlds of Marquez. The first few tens of pages of this book took off the way those in any other Marquez book do: slowly, but promisingly creating a solid loom to weave a tale on. And then the next tens of pages continued in the same vein, as did the next few chapters, and so on and so forth.   Actually, to be fair, at least a part of the problem could be with my expectations. I was expecting another stunning piece of writing, even if it was a recount of reality. But then, how many readers of Marquez would hold that against me and expect differently of him? After all, his books have been as much about his writing style as they have been about his vivid imagination, haven't they? So that's primarily what I felt let down about in this book - the book just fails to grip. Marquez's writing seems weak like never before (except for the odd brilliant phrase here and there), and there aren't enough interesting tales to tell anyway. The book never moves beyond the context-setting; there is almost no dramatic arc, and; there is hardly any climatic resolution.   To summarize quickly then, I would recommend this book to very die-hard Marquez fans only. The only real value of this book lies in helping Marquez's readers undestand how he came to be the writer he did. If you are prepared to go through 500 pages of tedium for that, go for it. 
 Assault On Precinct 13 is an action packed film starring Ethan Hawke (Training Day), Lawrence Fishburne (The Matrix), John Leguizamo (Carlito's Way), Brian Dennehy (First Blood), Ja Rule (Scary Movie 3), Gabriel Byrne (End Of Days), and Maria Bello (Secret Window).  The story is set on a very snowy day in Detroit where a group of the city's dirtiest criminals including cop killer and big time gangster Marion Bishop, played by Fishburne, are held in broken down Precinct 13 managed by troubled cop Jake Roenick, played by Hawke, and a few of his staff. All of a sudden, an army of corrupt police officers led by Marcus Duvall, played by Byrne, storm the precinct in an effort to kill everyone inside for the sake of getting their hands on Bishop. Jake finds himself put in a dilemma where he will have to put his hand in the hands of criminals to survive throughout the night and make it out alive.  The script, like the story, is vague. Ethan Hawke, who earned an Oscar nomination for Training Day, seems to be overacting; the screenplay, on the other hand, seems to have been written over a short period of time, giving the actors little to work with. And throughout the time the poor good guys and bad guys were held in the precinct, I was wondering why didn't anyone pick up a cell phone and call for back up!?  Mindless action movie lovers will love Assault, but avid film-goers, like myself, will most definitely pass it by.  Not really recommended  D 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 1. Watch the movie "Hustle & Flow." The handful of songs that are played all the way through sound good, especially the catchy and smooth "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" and "Hustle and Flow."  2. Get CD soundtrack to film. Discover to unpleasant surprise that virtually all of the songs on it are operating on the mental level of "Whoop That Trick." (That is to say, a very low IQ level, with endlessly repetitive choruses that aren't catchy.)  3. Realize that amongst the professional rappers on the soundtrack, the best one is professional actor Terrence Howard.  4. Smile bemusedly. Sell used CD 
 If you like your watercolors with lots of intricate details and reflections in crystal, you'll like this latest Splash. If you're looking for something different, experimental and creative, don't bother. I have the entire series, and I'm thinking of reselling this one. (I won't be purchasing any future editions without checking them closely first.) The Splash series was quite cutting edge in the early years, striving to showcase the new trends. But it hasn't kept up. Now it just feels like a profit center for North Light.   Of 130 pages, only 12 pages (the shortest chapter) is devoted to experimental watermedia. And even then, one painting includes reflections in crystal (just so you don't stray too far...)   Publishers, it's time for a change. We need a new series for the 21st Century (edited by Betsy Dillard Stroud or Nita Leland?) devoted to the exciting trends in watermedia, mixed media, collage, monotypes, and digital hybrid art. 
 I had really grown to enjoy Perez-Reverte's books after first reading some of his other stories such as the Fencing Master, the Flander's Panel, and the Queen of the South.  I thought I'd gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at $.45, but sometimes it's better to hang on to loose change.  In this book, the plot was weak from beginning to end, and the climax was unrealistic, even with a stretch of the imagination.   I was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable, anyway.  On several occasions I thought about putting the book down, and had I not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do, I probably would have.  This book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to  fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books, regardless of quality, before a certain date 
 This terrible unit damaged may carpeting. Even though I had placed it in a tray, still a half gallon water was leaked on my carpet 
  J. Lee Grady's "Ten Lies the Church Tells Women: How the Bible Has Been Used to Keep Women in Spiritual Bondage." is as the title says, VERY freeing.  DeMoss on the other hand, left me tired of the same 'ol same 'ol about women. The premise that there are lies ALL people believe is true enough, but to focus on women being decieved specifically is, well, old, tried and boring; ie, all have fallen short of the glory of God, so what's the point who's first? Please!  Women are not more easily decieved,Has anyone read about Jael?, Deborah?, Abigail?, and Paul's co-workers Euodia & Syntyche "in telling others the Good News" or Pricilla (her name comes first as the principle leader) and Aquilla?   More recently, Amee Simple McPhereson, Anne Hutchinson, Gladys Alward and many other women brought forth teachings of Salvation by faith and bold new churches and ministries. Let me punctuate this by saying God chose to work huge miracles through those women and chooses to work miracles through women today.   Not the least of miracles is that these women overcame the patriarchal weights and followed their God given passion, and today's women can also. DeMoss misses the point that women, too, are made in the image of God, not man's image. All are subject to Christ.   Alternatively I recommend, if you dare for an educated, solidly biblical challenge, Loren Cunningham's book "WHY NOT WOMEN?". (I bought 10 copies)! Loren Cunningham is the founder/director of YWAM who has (I surmise) placed more women missionaries oversees than any other Christian organization, so he may be one to whom you may want to give at least a polite "listen" .  Scriptural exegisis is by the co-author DAvid Hamilton.   Please dont construe this to be saying you have to agree with Cunningham/Hamilton, but any one who is honestly facing the challenge of examining women's roles, and open to examining how Greek and Roman mindsets tainted bible interpretation throughout the church age (duh) will come out with some real good tools to recognizing gnositic thinking and GREEK thinking that warp the scriptures and ARE THE REAL deception in the church age. When David Hamilton examines the ROOTS of the deceptions men (read patriarcy) have taught women, you can see clearly God's heart in the original texts, in both TEstaments, is for the equal use of the gifts and lives of women.   If it is scriptural truth that is the question in your own heart, then, you owe it to yourself to check out this very well researched book. DeMoss has good points for both genders on disappointments and unrealized expectations, but a bible commentator she is not. Everyone should just calm down a bit and read a broader spectrum on this discussion before firing "biblical" pot-shots. Read from other respected Christian men and women, and we can reason together,indeed, how to interpret the scriptures correctly. Kuddos to Cunningham/Hamilton for a brillant and long OVERDUE work!  I understand Loren Cunningham (who has been married to his wife Darlene 43 years )is writing his next book dealing directly with the issue of women in marriage and relationships; I can't wait, I'll be buying 10 copies. Then I'll send one to Nancy DeMoss . Maybe then she'll feel free to get married for the first time after being single for 50 years. 
 The self-improvement books How to Win Friends and Influence People and Talking the Winner's Way are both way superior to this short book. Most of what you read is basically review if you've ready other similar books. And what's present doesn't pack enough substance or "how to" to make it really worth your time. About half-way through the book, Gabor started presenting fresh ideas. The problem, however, is that it was half-way through the book. Not a bad read, but there's so much better. If you happen across it one day on the street, it won't do any harm to read it. But I can't recommend paying money for something you already know, or can get for a better deal 
     This was my first reading of anything by Franzen.I picked this book up at the same time as I got "Corrections".I decided to read this book first to get a feel for his work,but must admit was very disappointed.   I found that trying to get anything out of these essays was like looking for a white dove in a snowstorm.Obviously,he believes he has what it takes to be a good novelist.Maybe he is well versed in the techniques of writing,but he doesnt seem to know what he wants to say to the reader.His essays seem to be an attempt at observation,but he can't seem to pull his thoughts together and present a conclusion to the reader.   His concern about the literary novel going the way of the vinyl disc or the rotary phone,reminds me that it is the message not the medium that is important.   Maybe he has found his calling as a teacher of literary mechanics and should just leave the writing of novels to the gifted who know what they want to say and have the fire in their belly to pursue that path.   In his last essay ,it appears he drifts somewhere between being liberal or socialist minded;and maybe that is the problem.He is not happy with the way things are,doesn't know what would satisfy him and can't suggest any solution.Maybe he should start searching out some people who are positive,satisfied and successful.   Oh well,I guess I'll still give "Corrections" a try.Let's hope I like it better than this one 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 I write this review as I struggle to make myself finish watching this movie.  I've talked myself out of stopping it about 3 or 4 times, but I'm no quitter I'm going to persevere until the end.  The story line is so disjointed and the characters are disappointingly one dimensional. I've watched some really good independent black films like Love, Sex and Eating the Bones or 30 to Life, but Fair Game so far has been a waste of my time.  
 Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others 
 The author reinforces gender stereotypes with a "humorous" ending where the girl and boy exchange clothes, resulting in a teacher exclaiming to the boy about his wearing pink pants.  (You can tell it's sexist when you realize that navy blue pants wouldn't have worked.)  Imagine how gender non-conforming children feel to have their likes ridiculed in this way 
 Another bunch of blather, in my opinion. The biggest stock market crash in history may be coming. IS probably coming, even. But WHEN, Mr. Kiyosaki, WHEN? In 2016? It might, but you don't know, the chairman of the fed doesn't know, the President doesn't know, no one does. You're guessing. All your books say you're a money expert, based on a questionable autobiography, anecdotes, and a gullible public. I don't think Mr. Kiyosaki gives very good advice. I'd prefer Andrew Tobias, Ben Stein, or God help me, Suze Orman. Sorry 
 As a " molest survivor" I found this book offensive in it's disregard of Duncan's molestation of Daisy. I could not understand Mark's not telling Eva; reporting Duncan to the police nor could I understand why He,in a sense, protected Duncan by keeping "the secret". I am disappointed in Miller's handling of this subject and that she seems to downplay the evisceration of the soul this type of abuse can have on a young person. 
 TAFTP has its moments, but I dont think this book was the godsend others make it out to be.    An example of a good point is the author's notion of optimizing the cycle length to find the best %D to use for a particular security.  That's a good read.   The next chapter suggests drawing oodles of trendlines on a chart and looking for intersections.  If you draw enough lines on a chart you are bound to find one that supports what you believe.  I just ddnt buy her premise at all.    Some concepts that can be described quickly are laboriously drawn out.  5 pages dedicated to the dangers of looking at small charts where data can be compressed is 5 pages too much.    Other commentators have talked about "sophistication" and "complexity" as virtues of the book.  I disagree.   Complex doesnt mean better.  Simplicity breeds success remember.  This book gets wordy and its ideas are sometimes hard to understand.  That doesnt make it a better book nor does it make its ideas more credible.    The CMT has put this on their required reading list but I wouldnt give that too much weight.  They have been criticized that their syllabus isnt quantitative enough so they needed to incorporate something like this.  Besides, half the book isnt tested for CMT.    Lastly, like far too many technical analysis books, there is a lot of, "this makes total sense looking backwards," about this book.   Had you bought in 1994 at this signal (which became obvious in 1998) you would have made a lot of money!     Rather than shlep through TAFTP, there are better books out there.   Trading Sytems and Methods by Kaufman comes to mind 
 I beg to differ with other reviewers of this book. Although the book may have been regarded as a classic in its time, it cannot be recommended as a source for either self-study or as a reference book on set theory by present-day standards for mathematical writing. Its style varies from too concise to too verbose in an erratic manner. It attempts to combine rigor and lack of rigor, and does so inconsistently. There are no references to other works. Finally, I was particularly turned off by the last sentence of the Preface, the pompous and patronizing "read it, absorb it, and forget it." Those who are interested in elementary set theory are advised to consult the books by Robert Stoll and Patrick Suppes. Besides being much better written and more comprehensive, they are also cheaper. 
   This book is filthy.  I had to take a shower after I read it.  Why doesn't he get a job?  Why does he have to live in France? Why doesn't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers?  So many questions.  People just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say James Michenier because it was banned.  It was banned because it's a bad book 
 I have been reading this book out loud to my BF, who now worships Dr. Gray as it should be titled, "Why women should give men sex all the time".   Dr. Gray actually lists why we should give our man a quickie when we really don't want to, don't have time or are tired. He even says we should give a hand job when we have a bad headache!!! Men, if your woman has a headache, run her a warm bubble bath, light some candles, give her a massage and you'll increase your chances of getting some!   He also states that at certain times of the month many women don't feel the need to have an orgasm. I know LOTS of women and none of them will tell you orgasms are not important! Yes, sometime I will give my man a quickie and not worry about my orgasm, but that is totally up to me, NOT DR. GRAY.  He also states it's ok to look at other women in front of us as long as our men tell us they love us. Gee, not enough beautiful women on TV, billboards and magazines to look at when we're not around? I don't drool over other men when my man is around because I RESPECT him. If more couples respected each other they would have less trouble.  He has some good tips like men need to spend more time on foreplay, complimenting your woman, but I am on page 88 out of 206 and it has been overwhelmingly biased toward giving men what they want all the time and apparently at all costs 
 The metal pieces on the sides looked like they were going to slice my cat's throat!  threw it in the garbage 
 This book is absolute garbage on the highest level. Anyone who writes a good review for this is either related to nelson or spends most of thier time in cage swingin from a tyre throwing thier own excrement at the wall, or, most likely, both 
 ITS GREAT IF YOU HAVE EVERY OTHER CALPHALON LINE ITEM.  BUT DON'T BE FOOLED WHEN THEY MENTION STAINLESS STEAL,  IT DOES NOT, AGAIN DOES NOT FIT THE TRI-PLY STAINLESS STEAL 8QT. STOCKPOT AS IT INDICATED!(... 
 This deal was too good to be true. Of course I wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least I expected them to all work. I don't know if I got a bad earbud or what, but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used.  The case I didn't need, but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed. The power adapter seems to work fine. So basically I spent $9.99 and am only using the power adapter. I guess that's a good enough deal. I think I'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud/headset though 
 Simply, a terribly written book.  It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style.  His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour.  And that's all.  The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world.   The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of "the soul is love" type crap.  Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place 
 Two of my favorite CDs in the last couple of years were "Obrigado Brazil" and "In Full Swing" by Yo Yo Ma and Mark O'Connor respectively.  I found both of those CDs to be fine examples of genre-busting joyful music making.  So when I saw these guys paired here, I snapped it up.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The music throughout most of the CD sounds too labored, too studied.  It is, frankly, not that inspiring.  The playing throughout is, of course, of the highest calibre and the recorded sound excellent.  But there is no hint of the exhuberance of Folk or Bluegrass which is the supposed inspiration for the disc.  The guest spots by James Taylor and Alison Krauss are good but they sound like outtakes from their own CDs, these songs are out of context here.  (But note how many other Amazon reviews reference their contributions as reasons for loving the CD.  Perhaps so many five star ratings because these people need broader musical exposure?)  Too many critics over intellectualize.  I base my ratings on one simple criterion:  How much did the music move me?  In this case, not much 
 What is the point of this book? Its premise is a hoax. Paul didn't die. Sure, there was a rumor, and once started people started looking for facts to fit the bill. But, I repeat: Paul didn't die. He never even pretended to die. It wasn't a PR stunt, it isn't a proper Beatles story worth spending the time of day on -- it's just something that originated with a casual joke and gathered its own momentum. It had more to do with crackpot fans and conspiracy theories than reality. However well written a book about nothing might be, at the end of the day, it's still flimflam 
 The game footage here is very good, except it is constantly interrupted, and has no continuity. Some of the interviews seem genuine, while others are obviously staged. The students and players act as if they were given the green light by the director to be as gross and obnoxious as possible. In that, they succeeded.  Entries at the Sundance Film Festival must be awful indeed for this film to be a Grand Prize nominee. The coaches stand around in the locker room, while the players take turns giving each other the cursing of their lives. I was rooting for the opposing team to give Massillon a beating every game.    I can't recommend this film to anyone. It doesn't teach about football, the language is awful. I don't feel I know anything about Ohio football that I didn't know before I saw the film. I hope the Tigers are not a typical team in Ohio.   For a real football film, I recommend "The Last Game" 
 This book is not a good book at all.  The book has hardly any examples to help you learn the material.  It is full of problems at the end of each chapter, but it is hard to solve any of them due to the lack of worked out example problems.  The book is full of proofs of the financial formulas, which is a waste of time in the real world.  The book is hard to read and even harder to understand.  The only good use of this book is toilet paper and it wouldn't do a very good job at that either 
 Ok so the premise for the book is a good one, one star earned there. But the execution is retarded. For one, HH has the United States progress through four years of industrialization in a matter of months, completely ignoring the obvious impossibilities of such a rapid change in 1861. Second, how the hell could three/four corps conquer America and reincorperate the Americans back into the British empire, the limeys were not stupid as they are in this book. Basically the book completely devolves into a series of mindless drivel, entertaining drivel, one star 
 i have had this book in my library for a long time and very much looked forward to reading it. a book that got rave reviews by critics, an outstanding novelist (evan s connell) writing about the legendary downfall of custer at little bighorn, how could i go wrong with this one. well, i guess that there is no such thing as a sure thing, because i found this book way too long & way too tedious. the author digresses all throughout the book, dropping the narrative and taking off on dull useless sidetracks that should never have been included. dozens and dozens of characters are introduced that you will never rememeber (and will never need to remember). strange and poor organization make this book a real dud. too bad 
 I looked for an introduction to the basics of Office automation and bought this book.  Every example code I tried was incorrect and the examples are just all trivial.  Samples from the MSDN was just as good as this book.  If you only need a rough overview what technologies are out there, this book is OK.  But for any real programming it is not very useful. 
 Being a Greek myself I was incredibly disgusted and offended by some of the claims that were made in this book. The broad generalities were ridiculous. Not all sorority girls get drunk have sex and are anorexic. In fact over 20 of my 50 members do not drink and we're not even allowed to have scavenger hunts because it is nationally considered "hazing".  More offensive than the picture she paints of sorority girls was the fact that she shared so many secrets about ceremonies.   A great deal of the information she acquired are things that we in our sorority have NEVER written down but has been passed down for over a 10o years through traditions and secret ceremonies. I was upset to see some of these things written down in a book that bashed the greek system.  I'm not saying all greeks are perfect but to conclude that most are like the ones in this book is just upsetting 
 i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit, but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting. The ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world.Dont even rent this, i dont even know why you are considering the film.  I only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since. 
 Jessica Simpson is through being famous for her "talent" and is now known primarily for her sex appeal and stupidity.  When she started out years ago in the music business, she had a pretty good singing voice.  Now she's filled up her CD's with bubble-gum lyrics and a breathy, whispery, off-key voice.  Where other artists have grown in their musical talent, Jessica appears to have stayed the same, and maybe even gone downhill.  I don't feel that this CD is worth the price.  
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 This product is worse than useless.  Right off the bat, the tutorials do not behave as depicted.  What is left does not run properly.  I spent hours and hours trying to make a CD from an LP, all to no avail.To make matters worse, this bug infested monstrosity, has very poor support.  There is no 800 number.  The version that I had came with 10 days of tecnical assistance that was useless!  After the 10 days, technical assistance costs $1.29 a minute, plus the cost of the long distance call! I REPEAT!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  
 Whole Foods recipes are not as healthy as they prescribe, nor that tasty.  We have tried several recipes from this book with hopes that we would find something that would satisfy us.  We never found any 
 Item received not the same as pictured - cost more to send it back and reorder - disappointed.  
 This is a nice book but not a good buy at about $50! Nice pictures that you might look at again sometime in the future but not much info if you want a reference for Yoga.  What is needed in the Yoga community is a book like "Strength Training Anatomy"  By Frederic Delavier.( at about $15 this is THE BOOK to have in your collection!!) Detailing Yoga asanas that work the various muscle groups.  
 This is a difficult review to write, because I so rarely write average reviews. I was excited to have a look at this book after reading the fantastic reader comments, and because the author is from my hometown. What I read disappointed me. I found the writing choppy and difficult to understand in some chapters. I was looking for beautiful artwork to compliment the written pages, but did not find any. This book read as if the author threw the pages together in one weekend. A disappoinment 
 The NY Times (Author Howell Raines) says it better than I ever could:  Comes now Robert McNamara with the announcement that he has in the fullness of time grasped realities that seemed readily apparent to millions of Americans throughout the Vietnam War. At the time, he appeared to be helping an obsessed president prosecute a war of no real consequence to the security of the United States. Millions of loyal citizens concluded that the war was a militarily unnecessary and politically futile effort to prop up a corrupt government that could neither reform nor defend itself.  Through all the bloody years, those were the facts as they appeared on the surface. Therefore, only one argument could be advanced to clear President Johnson and Mr. McNamara, his Secretary of Defense, of the charge of wasting lives atrociously. That was the theory that they possessed superior knowledge, not available to the public, that the collapse of South Vietnam would lead to regional and perhaps world domination by the Communists; and moreover, that their superior knowledge was so compelling it rendered unreliable and untrue the apparent facts available to even the most expert opponents of the war.  With a few throwaway lines in his new book, "In Retrospect," Mr. McNamara admits that such knowledge never existed. Indeed, as they made the fateful first steps toward heavier fighting in late 1963 and 1964, Mr. Johnson and his cabinet "had not truly investigated what was essentially at stake and important to us." As for testing their public position that only a wider war would avail in the circumstances, "We never stopped to explore fully whether there were other routes to our destination."  Such sentences break the heart while making clear that Mr. McNamara must not escape the lasting moral condemnation of his countrymen.  Mr. McNamara wants us to know that he, too, realized by 1967 that the dissidents were right, that the war had to be stopped to avoid "a major national disaster." Even so, he wants us to grant that his delicate sense of protocol excused him from any obligation to join the national debate over whether American troops should continue to die at the rate of hundreds per week in a war he knew to be futile. Mr. McNamara believes that retired cabinet members should not criticize the presidents they served no matter how much the American people need to know the truth. In Mr. McNamara's view, the president can never become so steeped in a misguided war that patriotic duty would compel a statement.  Perhaps the only value of "In Retrospect" is to remind us never to forget that these were men who in the full hubristic glow of their power would not listen to logical warning or ethical appeal. When senior figures talked sense to Mr. Johnson and Mr. McNamara, they were ignored or dismissed from government. When young people in the ranks brought that message, they were court-martialed. When young people in the streets shouted, they were hounded from the country.  It is important to remember how fate dispensed rewards and punishment for Mr. McNamara's thousands of days of error. Three million Vietnamese died. Fifty-eight thousand Americans got to come home in body bags. Mr. McNamara, while tormented by his role in the war, got a sinecure at the World Bank and summers at the Vineyard.  So much has changed since those horrendous times. The nation has belatedly recognized the heroism of the American troops who served in good faith because they, in their innocence, could not fathom the mendacity of their elders. But another set of heroes - the thousands of students who returned the nation to sanity by chanting, "Hell, no, we won't go" - is under renewed attack from a band of politicians who sat out the war on student or family deferments. In that sense we are still living in the wreckage created by the cabinet on which Mr. McNamara served.  His regret cannot be huge enough to balance the books for our dead soldiers. The ghosts of those unlived lives circle close around Mr. McNamara. Surely he must in every quiet and prosperous moment hear the ceaseless whispers of those poor boys in the infantry, dying in the tall grass, platoon by platoon, for no purpose. What he took from them cannot be repaid by prime-time apology and stale tears, three decades late.  Mr. McNamara says he weeps easily and has strong feelings when he visits the Vietnam Memorial. But he says he will not speak of those feelings. Yet someone must, for that black wall is wide with the names of people who died in a war that he did not, at first, carefully research or, in the end, believe to be necessary.  God damn Robert Strange McNamara to hell. (My comment 
 This book was required reading for me in my Political Science class over 20 years ago when I was in college. By this point in human history, humanity was supposed to be doomed. I agree with a previous reviewer who pointed out that the authors simply fail to take into account human ingenuity and the resilience of the planet and its inhabitants.  But hey, if you want to incessantly worry and fret, this book is probably for you 
 This text is a nightmare.  Terms are poorly defined, if defined at all, and examples are few and far between.  The illustrations are laughable.  I've seen better graphics in nursery books written 30 years ago.  If your professor assigns this text, and you're new to Java, be prepared to shell out more bucks for better sources or cruise the Internet to get the answers you need.  This book won't provide them.  
 This travel guide is just okay. It doesn't go into detail at each destination, just an overview. I expected details especially in Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah and Charlotte. I did not find this book helpful 
 We know Rita Mae can write.  I remember one Thanksgiving years ago reading parts of one of her books aloud to my sisters and all of laughing so hard we cried.  She had captured reality and presenting it wondrously.  This book however shows none of that talent.  Most of the dialog comes across as extremely stilted and unrealistic 
 I used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it.  Boy are they right.  This thing is terrible.  After installing on Windows XP SP2, as soon as I started the program it crashed.  Now every time I try to scan using my Canon Scanner, it crashes every time.  Product is useless.  Wish I had of never bought it!  DO NOT BUY! 
 It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash. 
 Now I know that there is a difference a BIG difference between a songwriter, poet and comedian. I know this book is not intended to be funny, but to me the poetry "It is poetry:thoughts" was just funny to me. I cannot give this book a fair rating because it is not a fair book. When will songwriter, actors, atheletes,models whatever! realize that just because they are good at one thing, doesn't mean that they are good at the other! God help the corporate/mainstream talent industry 
 Decent starting point for cooking-impaired college students if they don't mind eating eggs and potatoes often.  A little more variation in the recipes would be nice as well as some pointers on how to substitute ingredients and an explanation on why some ingredients do (What is the purpose of using cornstarch?  I know, some of it is common sense, but heyyyyyyy.... I'm a stupid college student). For example, for one recipe for frying chicken, I used pork and it tasted fine.     Also, some of the recipes don't really work.  Baking chicken drumsticks at 375 degrees in the oven for 40 minutes is not enough for thoroughly cooked chicken.     On the upside, the cooking tips were really helpful.  The book could use more of those, like be aware that if you heat oil, it pops and it could land on your face or burn your arm.  Overall, this book provides some ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it too much.  Not really worth the purchase.  Flip through it in the bookstore like I did and save some bucks for uhhh.... buying food. = 
 Are we living in the end times is just what I expected.  Typical apologetic Christian scare tactics based on irrational fantasies. What should scare you is the nastiness of the previous "Christian" reviewers attitudes toward each other.  A person whom may be interested in the Christian worldview likely would be even more confused and probably put off by these people.  Why should they bother to read Mr. LaHaye's opinions or for that matter the Bible itself, since all these people have read these same books and come to such different interpretations  and conclusions.  If they're looking for love and comfort, why should they want to join a group of people that not only look forward to the world being destroyed and 80 percent of the nice people inhabiting it to be murdered and tortured forever, but also seem to hate people of their own faith?      Christians have such diverse opinions because the fact is that the Bible is hopelessly contradictory, no matter how hard apologists like LaHaye try to twist and destort its words to make it form to their own biases.  By all means, READ the New Testament.  Take your time, don't use study guides that try to tell you what they think it means, keep an open mind and THINK FOR YOURSELF. You will find that there is no question that the people writting the New Testament thought that the "end of the world" was going to happen in thier lifetimes.  Pay attention to Matt. 24 when Jesus says he will be back during that generation, or Matt. 16 where people standing there will not have drawn thier last breath before the second coming occurs.  You don't use terms like "the time is nigh", "the end of all things is at hand" or the first words of Revelations itself " the things which MUST SHORTLY come to pass" if you think it might take a couple of thousand years.  When the Bible says the world is flat, the sky is a solid dome supported by pillars with windows in it for the rain, space is full of water, and that giant human/angels used to inhabit the earth, it is wrong.  When it says that invisible people who live in the sky are going to come and destroy the earth and just about everybody in it, that again is wrong. More importantly, it is not moral or anything close to love, which the religious are always claiming they have so much of.       Don't wait for someone to come do some magic and make all your problems go away. Get off your knees and do it yourself. 
 If you, like me, have recently discovered this amazing writer recently you will be tempted to read his final words laid out in this book.  I however was a little disappointed.  The writing does not flow effortlessly.  He refers to a lot of names (politicians, artists, and writers, etc.) and places, but I'm afraid the majority of these references will only make sense to a European history buff.  In fact, much of the book will only hold the interest of a history student.  I had hoped the book would document HIS world of yesterday thoroughly--his motivations for writing particular books etc.--instead it goes into details about Europe far too much.  An OK read, but if you want to skip this one you won't be missing much.  Maybe his best work was far too good and this mediocre, long-winded good-bye pales against it 
 This is a very angrily written book.  It is hard to take it too seriously even when there are some segments of truth.  Author has an axe to grind 
 This is THE WORST vacuum we have ever had.  It doesn't pick up pet hair - what the heck? It doesn't do bare floors, it sucks up and chews up persian rugs, it is self propelled? You have got to be kidding me!  I have to push this thing harder than any vacuum ever.  I went to Wal Mart and Lowes to get a new belt for it, this is the 4th belt we have gone through in one year and neither places have it.  Now what?  It is a very heavy vacuum.  Bringing it upstairs nearly kills ya.  It is by far the loudest vacuum there is, a super loud droning sound that sends the animals wild each time you turn it on.  In a small room it is absolutely deafening!  I hate it, I do not recommend it.  If someone on here does - they are lying to you!  This is the worst vacuum we have owned.  I can visibly see dust and dirt SHOOT out the back when I vacuum (even after cleaning it out) so much for the Hepa filter!!!  Don't buy this vacuum, you will want to throw it through a window like I do and even my husband wants to do!! 
 This is an earnest if clumsily written book about redemption and believing in yourself.  The dialogue is wooden and the characters are completely one dimensional.  The author is trying to make a statement about caring for the environment, but it just ends up to be preachy and pedantic.  There are far better young adult fantasy series on the market, and I would not recommend this one 
 This book's description sparked my interest and led me to think that it would fill a gap in Eliot scholarship. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book does not quite achieve what it sets out to do 
 Solutions are sometimes even more abstruse than the problems and concepts themselves.  Someone got lazy writing out these solutions!  Plus, more than half the problems are not solved in this book.  Not worth $34 in my opinion 
 A neighbor gave me this book to read.  I have read the DaVinci Code and I thought it was good fiction mixed with some fact.  Of Course Dan Brown strings together many unrelated truths half truths and fabrications to make his story interesting, so it is quite easy to write an expose showing where he stepped over the line.  This critique of The DaVinci Code goes too far the other way trying to spin "Orthodox" Christianity as the only true religion and the "Orthodox" point of view the only "true" history of the last 2000 years.  The authors have dumbed down the subject matter, omitted information and scholarship contrary to their point of view, and created a book that borders on propaganda.  One part of the book that I found very annoying was the failure to address the historical excesses of institutional or "Orthodox" Christianity.  The Authors criticise Brown for writing that the Church (both Catholic and Protestant) Burned or otherwise murdered "Millions" of heretics.  The authors concede that the number is closer to 50 or 60 thousand.  So which is worse?  Making a mistake concerning the number of heretics murdered?  Or defending the institution that actually murdered thousands of people?  (And I would assume if we add in the Crusades both against the Muslims and the "heretics" we'd probably get a lot closer to the million than thousand figure.)  Another spin made by the authors actually caused me to laugh out loud.  You should read how these "Orthodox" scholars are spinning the female responsibility for the fall/oppression of females nexus.  Here's what they say.  The original sin in the Bible was Adam not working hard enough to spiritually protect his family.  This is a very "unorthodox" and "unbiblical spin designed to distract you from the fact that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have for centuries oppressed women because Eve ate the Fruit First.  What does Brother Paul say about it     11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.  12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp* authority over the man, but to be in silence*.  13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  15 Notwithstanding she* shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety   I think Paul would be very angry reading the Author's attempt to put a "new age" spin the scripture to fit a more modern interpretation of the story.  This spin also flies in the face of Christian History.  And I do not feel any better about it even though the Authors point out that pagan cultures have abused women as well.  So what?  Do two wrongs make a right? If Orthodox Christianity is "true" why did it take the institution almost 2000 years to figure out that men and women were equal and figure out that the story in Genesis and Paul's exposition of it were wrong?   Ultimately this book fails because it is plain dishonest.  Yes it points out some issues where Dan Brown obviously inflates the truth, or even creates it out of nothing.  Brown's book has historical errors and it does have a point of view and an agenda.  However, this does not excuse the propaganda and misdirection contained in "Cracking Da Vinci's Code." 
 Not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position. The wheels have a mind of their own. The handles make it hard to go up curbs. Hard to close up, need both hands and foot.  But can fit a Graco infant car seat, compact fold, and light 
 The book starts out well enough when banker Ben Hartman, in Switzerland on business, runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him.  Then through a series of accidental discoveries, narrow escapes, and unbelievable coincidences, Hartman learns that practically everybody he knows, and everyone new he meets, is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination. When you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is, it seems like something only Austin Powers' nemesis Dr. Evil could have pulled off.  Without giving too much away - I have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain's heavily-guarded, secret mountain lair.  And of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero.  Yeah baby, yeah 
 I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.  
 I am usually a very patient reader, but this book was simply unnerving. The plot is disorganized, the caracters nothing more than stereotypes, the writing erratic, to put it mildly. The main character's (Bess) behavior is so irritating that it makes one wonder why would anyone ever want to be around her, yet she is not only being assisted and protected but manages to order around what are supposed to be seasoned CIA professionals - one of whom is a "man with the past", a killer, rugged on the outside and soft-hearted inside...blah. The author mixed a whole lot - war/slaughter in Croatia, bioterrorist attack in Mexico and the US, middle east fanatics. Knowing that the book was published in 1998, the plot may have even sounded prophetic at times, if the writing was better and the story compact. Moreover, the author seems to have real problems with facts - in example, there is no Danzar village in Croatia, nor Tenajo in Mexico (I don't know if this was intentional, although I do not see a reason for imaginary place while the other places in the book are factual - Atlanta, New Orleans etc). Is this book readable....yes, barely...in my opinion this is a bunch of badly written mumbo-jumbo hastily put together. I am giving this book a star only because it still took some work to put together 300+ pages of this nightmare. 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 This book is now 11 years old. Lot of informations are missing now 
 This video copy of this movie was one of the worst I have ever purchased. The DVD would play for about a minute then freeze up. I could not enjoy the movie. After complaining about the poor quality of the movie I was granted a refund but still lost out on the shipping cost. The movie is listed as Language English but the copy that I rceieve was in Mandarin or chinese. Very dissapointing 
 This book is rather sad. The non-scientist author, like his hero Velikovsky, just doesn't understand many of the technical issues he writes about. Velikosky was so obviously wrong that very few scientists tried to refute him. Carl Sagan was one of the few who took on this task, primarily as lead speaker at the AAAS Symposium held in 1974 to discuss Velikovsky's ideas. Sagan pointed out a dozen or so of the major contraditions in Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision; he wrote up his remarks for publication in the book that came out of the Symposium, Scientists Confront Velikovsky (Don Goldsmith, editor), and reprinted it as a chapter in one of his own books. That was it. Sagan's paper was hardly a definitive analysis of Velikovsky, and he never corrected it to make the arguments tighter. This book seems to claim that Sagan spent a great deal of time dealing with Velikovsky, and even that he used the AAAS symposium as a springboard to fame. That is simply wrong. Velikovsky may have obsessed about Sagan, but Sagan had far more important things on his mind than Velikovsky. Nor did this excursion into the realm of pseudoscience do anything to advance Sagan's career. In that sense, this book is devoted to a non-issue. 
 Anna Qiuindlen wrote a very jeuvenile novel this time.  Her past books were worthy of praise but this is a silly story. I was very disappointed and need to remind myself not to buy a book from an author that I have previously enjoyed until I read reviews.  
 This book does not provide valuable information about learning systems. It demonstrates, that nonlinear dynamics can be used to describe a subclass of learning. I personally doubt, that this subclass is of great interest, because it neglects completely heuristic strategies in game playing. Besides this, nonlinear dynamics is only useful if the number of parameter of the system is small. I doubt, that these toy examples are sufficient to describe reality, e.g., economics.  Moreover, the organization of the book and the style it is written in, is in my view not favorable.   I guess, this book is for a very small readership that does not have to worry about the correspondence of a model with nature. But also from this perspective it can not be recommended, because it is not written well. Both thumbs down 
 As a teacher, I feel that this book can benefit all of my students in their quest for freedom as described by Tarthang Tulku. I especially recommend this resource for persons interested in learning more about their internal mechanisms or patterns of conditioning. This book has helped me learn what Freedom is really about in contrast to our president and others who base their understanding of freedom on religious beliefs, insecurities and prejudices 
 I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died.  About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile.  It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.    Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher!  Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious.  I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.    I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore.    Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name 
 There is nothing I can add here that most of the other reviewers have not already stated.  I bought this book off the discount shelf, on a whim for the title and description - ironically, for Tosches explains exactly such buyer whims in the letter he wrote to his publisher in the long middle chapter of the book.  If not for the huge sign proclaiming "Hardcover Bestsellers for $7.99" (who can resist browsing for a hardcover at that price?), I might have continued a blissful ignorance of Nick Tosches altogether.  I learned long ago, however, that serious readers are often explorers in the spirit of Columbus, always searching for new horizons and occasionally colliding with the unknown.  As unintentionally or unthinkingly as the collisions occur, they nonetheless influence the paths of our lives.  So it is with my first encounter with Nick Tosches and "In the Hand of Dante."  Though engaged variously by some of the characters; the intellectual discourse on Catholicism and papacy; and an honest baring of the soul that reveals how difficult it is indeed to create - this book was a maddening reading experience.  An original idea that could have been crafted into a satisfying story, Tosches instead vomits a gush of chapters that present a barely cohesive narrative.  Yeah, Nick is a smart guy.  Yet for all the cleverness and complexity he tries to weave into this story, pedantic prose and self-indulgence seem more the work of an average college freshman writing a theme paper than that of an acclaimed author.  I give it two stars because I liked Lou, the hitman, and for the fact that it wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it.  Still, Tosches intrigues me enough that I'd like to read another of his books.  Don't let me down, Nick 
 If "wear a tiara to the grocery store" is the type of advice you're looking for- you'll love this 
 I was really hoping to find some great information and insight into unschooling with this book.  What I found was one woman's narrow-minded opinions about parenting.  The foundation for her strong opinions appears to be a traumatic childhood, a few 1970's books on unschooling, and the experience of raising her only child.    She is extreme and harsh in her judgments.  Nothing stated in this book is backed by any sort of data.  If you actually look up her daughter online, you will find a woman who is unsure about her radical upbringing.  The daughter does not view the experience with the same nostalgia and romance as her mother.  Needless to say, I think this book was a disaster.  If you are looking for a very extreme viewpoint on unschooling presented as one woman's memoir, than this is the book for you.  If you are looking for some genuine insight and information on unschooling, I would look elsewhere. 
 This book wasn't what I expected. I was searching for a book about all types of intimacy - friendship, family and romance. But this just focused on romance. Also, the religious quoting and writing throughout the book made me uncomfortable. 
 The heart of Mama Gena's advice is this: Know what you want AND Ask for what you want.  This is something that women, and I'm one of them, seem to have a difficult time doing.  It can work, not always, but often it can work especially if you are unwilling to tolerate anything else or to do it yourself.  However advice is only good if it can be heard and accepted.  The tone of this book is one of, its difficult to classify, but some type of "hip," urban, lingo between "sister goddesses".  The level of familiarity made me uncomfortable, the number of vague vignettes were unhelpful, and the focus on feeling your sexuality also a bit vague.  That is my biggest complaint: lots of general advice, little concrete suggestions and examples even though there are numerous "exercises" throughout the book.  This isn't about "men" this is really about women and should be marketed as such 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 We have "It's So Amazing" and I was looking for something more puberty specific for my daughter to read. I was reading it last night and I was SHOCKED at how blunt the book is.  Now, I consider myself to be a relatively liberal & laid back person, and openness about sexuality is not a problem at our house.  However this book reads like something out of an abstinence manual.  It starts off with the basics....the hows and whys....then slowly moves on to pregnancy....uh, huh, yep....then it starts spiraling downward from there.  Want to have sex?  You'll end up pregnant and need an abortion.  Still think sex is fun? Well look at ALL THE STDs you can get from having sex, and lets go in to it in the most graphic detail we can.  Haven't had enough?  Well, have sex and you'll get AIDS.  That's right, we've even included a picture of you, in the hospital, hooked up to an IV because you're dying of AIDS.  My take on the book?  Just don't have sex. You'll get pregnant. And it will kill you.  Seriously, all humor aside....this is a book that is supposed to be for children 10 years and up, and the subject matter is just WAY too intense for a young child.  Some of that stuff is info you will learn as you are older and can emotionally and mentally process it.  I am not too sure WHY the author felt the need to be so blunt....it starts off as though the reader has no concept of puberty and sexuality and quickly moves on to abortion and STDs.  In the reviews at Amazon.com a lot of people complained about "questionable morality" issues in the book.  Quite the opposite, I think this a great book for those who support abstinence.....I think. 
 When I bought this book I did not realize that it was written after the movie.  It is not good Graham Greene.  The book follows the movie closely but, it adds very little.  As I read the story I miss the music.  Save your money and buy the DVD 
 I had read the first chapter or so of this book in my email book club. I enjoyed it, and felt that Emily would be a relatable and interesting character, so when I saw it in my public library, I decided to give it a try. I read the whole thing in about a day, not really because it was great--more so that it was just a very quick, light read. The authors fail to develop some of the most interesting characters beyond mere cliches, and spend too much time on less interesting ones.   Now, I'm not saying the book wasn't cute and amusing--a quick, light, and often funny read. (I almost think Emily's hilarious boss was the highlight of the whole book!) But I, like several other reviewers, was disappointed about the lack of depth of spiritual depth. Emily, in the beginning of the story, seems like she will be the kind of girl to have a strong faith and stand out from the crowd. After all, she always says she wants to change the world. But, instead, she follows the crowd, doesn't even admit she's a Christian to her closest friends, (she only admits she's a Christian to her very closest friend, and stands up for her faith at the very last minute, so that it hardly seems sincere) and begins drinking rather heavily. I thought the authors would use that to show how she'd changed by the end of the book, but it instead shows her laughing with her friends (over multiple beers) about how she refused to drink alcohol the first time they went out to a bar together. Another thing that bothered me was how Emily attended a singles bowling night with Christians from a local church, and repeatedly put them down, portraying them as boring, corny, and behind the times. I sincerely hope that the authors (and am almost sure that it was not their intent) did not mean to put down more conservative Christians, who do not drink and who don't try to be worldly, as Emily does. But, even if the scene was intended to be funny, it fell rather flat.  Overall, the book was cute and funny, but not one that did anything at all spiritually. Emily doesn't change the world, and this book certainly won't change anyone's life 
 If he would have done any research at all, he would have found that no one ever "ordered" the library at Alexandria to be sacked. It caught fire during a naval battle quite by accident. Its unfortunatly true because nothing or at least very little made it out.  No narative I have ever read or heard of has ever claims otherwise. Ceasar was not the type to either sack or torch a library 
 This is a book that could (should?) have faded into history without being a great loss to the world. Yes, there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy, but they're far and few between, and mainly either just thrown out as Montesquieu's personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination, or flimsily based on historical examples. As a reader, I didn't find most of his arguments (where he didn't seem to be contradicting himself, which happens frequently) very convincing. This was obviously written with the 18th century French salon crowd in mind, and reads as such. I'm sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time, but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history.  He claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal; well, I did read the whole book and at the end couldn't see an overarching structure at all. The work just seemed like a long, rambling, unorganized mess. The only people I might really recommend this to are people interested in Greek, Roman, and French history (especially legal history), but not to people interested in political science or philosophy.  Bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought, there are much more interesting reads out there 
 This is a collection of short stories revolving around the new founder of her own detective agency.  The book spends a fair amount of time on local color.  The mysteries, if you can call them that, are light weight.  There's nothing wrong with any of that, often I want a light read, but there were two big factors that I could not get around that make me give a one star rating.  First, the people in Botswana are presented very negatively, and the men are even worse than the women.  Maybe most Botswanans truly are self-centered bastards, but I found that too hard to believe.  (Even so, I could accept that depiction in a hard-boiled detective book, but this is more of a sunny-side-up book.)  Second, the author keeps presenting contradictory pictures of the characters, particularly the main character.  In one story she is shown as exceptionally honest, while most other stories show her freely lying.  In one story she says she would never commit a crime, and in another story she steals a car.  In one story she is attracted to a man who beats and rapes her, in some stories she has no interest in any man, and in one story she is attracted to an apparently nice man.  I kept asking myself if the author was trying to make some point by these contradictions, but I couldn't discern any theme and came to believe it was simply poor writing 
 In 1972, I was real excited about going to a film school and becoming a filmmaker. In the back of this book, there was a list of colleges offering film degrees. I chose one of those listed, the University of Oregon in Eugene. After a freshman year of fun, I went into my counselor and said I was ready to declare my major in film. "We don't have a film school here." he solemnly stated. "But it's in the book!" I exclaimed. I immediatly tried to get into UCLA, but the wait was 1 1/2 years. Thus endeth my pursuit of a film career (I'm now in TV advertising). I found this book recently in a bookstore and sure enough...it still lists U of Oregon as offering a film degree! 
 The writer has a typical poachers attitude with many stories that seem to be exagerated and doubtful.  Some of the techniques he boasts about are impractical.  The writer attempts to say that he knows how to manage  wildlife better than biologists.  He knows nothing about managing wildife  over an entire state.  It is obvious that he would not be able to manage  wildife over a small section of land either because once his poaching  depletes the area he moves on somewhere else.  He cares nothing about the  rights of people in general and only about himself.  He is no more than any  other typical poacher who brags about his poaching. He is obviously under  the impression that poaching without getting caught make him the great  hunter.  He doesn't have a cluse and unfortunately never learned to  appreciate nature and the outdoors 
 This is a very nice and soft blanket, the best out of all electric blanket.  However, I have to return 2x due to the malfunction controller.  After only 2 weeks of usage, one of the controller started blinking E and no heat at all.  Same problems twice! I can't recommend this item until the problem is fixed 
 Longtime fans of Scott O'Dell's classic Island of the Blue Dolphins, do yourself a favor and avoid this lackluster sequel.  Island of the Blue Dolphins was one of my favorite books as a kid.  I must've read it at least a dozen times.  Somehow, I didn't find out that it had a sequel until years later.  Intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Island, which kind of ends on a cliffhanger, I read Zia.  I was interested in seeing how Scott O'Dell would handle what happens to Karana when she is finally rescued off the island after being stranded for 18 years.  As you probably know, Island of the Blue Dolphins was based on a true story, but the facts are few about the real Lost Woman.  So how would the talented writer Scott O'Dell concoct what happens to Karana?  The result, Zia, is terribly disappointing.  For starters, fans of Karana won't have much to read about.  At least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her.  The story is told completely from the niece's point of view.  We never get to hear what Karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years, and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone.  We learn almost nothing about what happened to Karana's father and sister, just that her sister's children have ended up orphans in a missionary.  And sadly, there's nothing interesting about Karana's niece Zia and her brother.  They merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper-thin story out over 100 pages or so.  I now appreciate the "cliffhanger" ending of Island of the Blue Dolphins in its perfect simplicity.  It is better to leave the story when Karana leaves the island, and let it be.  Your own imagination about what it was like for Karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in Zia.  I wish I could erase Zia from my mind.  Zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written 
 ...then you'll see how easy it is to give good customer service. I noticed most of the reviewers are managers and Human Resource trainers, not the people actually on the front line. Just try getting screamed at, cursed at, things hurled at you, and called all kinds of different names from an irate customer. Also try wading through the asinine company policies that tie your hands and keep you from helping the customer the way they deserve. Along with a lower than you can live off salary, and you have the average customer service rep and what we have to deal with every day.  This book misses the mark in so many ways. It caters to people living in a dream world and have high enough positions that they dont have to deal with the public. But I'm sure they think this book's ideas are "neat-o

 Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:  We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results.  Here is my update, which I wrote November 3:  This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing "the entire internal mechanism" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.  
 Visuals are stunning, editing is superb - so if you need a visual guide to the Bible, this is pretty good. Unfortunately, that is where the good ends.  Bruce Feiler sets out on a quest to visit all the biblical landmarks of its first five books, but the trip has an inherent weakness - Mr. Feiler is a skeptic. He is taking a journey of faith but rationalizes each and every step he takes. For example, ascending the Mt. Ararat, where the Bible says the Ark of Noah rested; he wonders where all the waters would have come from in the first place. He wonders - melting ice-caps? In other words, Bruce Feiler is looking for a rational explanation for the Great Flood!   If Bruce Feiler believes that there was a garden of Eden as the Bible says (his very first stop), then he must also believe that God made the heavens and the earth, as the Bible says! If HE can create the Heavens and the Earth by the Word of HIS mouth, HE can also perform miracles. You cannot pick and choose what you believe based on your so-called rationality - either the Bible is true in its entirety, or it is not. If it is not true, then it does not need Bruce Feiler's help to prop up its so-called "stories".   This aspect of Bruce Feiler journey is oft repeated - and very perplexing.  Why set out on such a journey if you do not believe your Guidebook? More examples? Bruce Feiler suggest that since the Sinai wilderness could not support the number of people the Bible says crossed over from Egypt, therefore the numbers must be wrong. How about the Manna being nothing but the gum of some wilderness tree in Sinai? I could go on....but you get the point. After a while, this becomes very annoying.  If you are a believer, this is not for you. I would not recommend it for my children. 
 These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance 
 This is one of the best Evans tittles, of course..., but at least this edition, (the first in cd, 1989), needs a deep mastering. 
 "I have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask. I have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it. "  Psh. That's nothing. I've had mine for over a year, and still haven't finished it. For starters, the characters aren't especially likeable.  And the author seems more intent on impressing us with his (obviously thorough) research than on telling a good story.  I suspect this is a show book: One of those books folks buy because it looks good to have on one's bookshelf, but that doesn't necessarily get read.  I was disappointed 
 I'm facinated by business and marrying the Kingdom of God to the topic of business really captured my attention. I couldn't wait to read the book. Each chapter was dissapointing with few, new thoughts. I think college students and those new to business may find this useful but those who have already spent much time in business or considering how business and the glory of God go together may not find much new to chew on here. I believe the author is a professor and not a businessman--which may be why he didn't deliver as much as I had hoped 
 With all the five stars having been given this movie, I expected much more. The packaging of the DVD gives a false impression (looks nice on the outside but inside mostly repackaged old stuff.) While the historical context of gay life is worthy of perhaps four stars, the feature itself rates less. It is short at seventy-six minutes. The picture quality for this overpriced DVD is poor. The outtakes are very poor. They appear to be copied from an old worn out VHS tape with no remastering. Don't expect much from this DVD. 
  I am chubby's great grand son on the so called dumb farmgirls side. I find it very disrespectful to write a book about a man's history without interviewing or elaborating on the one person who was there. My grandmother could shed more light on the Orange Blossom conspiracy than any one alive. she has shared very vivid and detailed stories about the man and the song. And believe me, she is no dumb farmgirl. She is brilliant and deserves some respect for keeping an entire family together while he turned his back on them 
 I will start by admitting that I am not a Catholic, and not a Chrisitan.  I was raised Protestant, and thus a lot of energy that I've put into studying Christianity was focused on Protestantism.  A Catholic friend of mine recommended me this book, as I was looking for some factual history on the church.  That background being given, this book is dangerous.  It is extremely conservatively biased, almost completely one sided.  However, it is presented as God's Gospel Truth and many people will read it that way.  Crocker's book does not lie (at least not much) persay- his bias is not in reinventing the truth, but rather in re-framing it in a way that makes his case sound convincing.  This makes it very seductive to logical people who haven't heard the other side of the story.  One of the continuing trends in this book is the outright demonization of non-catholics.  Any catholic can be forgiven his downfalls, which are mentioned offhandedly, if at all, while non Catholics are almost always incapable of being decent people.    Here are some of the beliefs that Crocker (an amusingly ironic name, I might note) has steeped into his history: -In the opening quotation, he advocates the abandoning of reason and a return to faith.  Reason has been the spark for all of the developments of the modern world.  At the same time, he pushes Catholicism as the sole source of reason, without really showing how the religion is rational.  When reason disagrees with him, he sees it as evil; when Catholics forge their own reasons, he lauds them as the only ideas that make sense.  Near the end of the book (p. 413), he states (almost explicitly) that non-catholics are incapable of reasonable, intelligent discussion. -He advocates monarchy over democracy.  "Monarchy and monotheism go together," he writes.  He basically blames democracy and nationalism for everything that went wrong in the twentieth century- as if his beloved Christian kings didn't start wars for power or land.  He glorifies the crusades, and it actually sounds like he wants more of them.  He lauds the dark ages as a high point for Christianity.  He applauds Napoleon.  While he is always ready with the number of deaths caused by things like the Reformation, he never ever gives a death toll for the wars he supports. -He supports a very conservative view of women, lauding Paul and Napoleon's views- in Napoleon's words, the "weakness of women's brains, the instability of their ideas... their need for perpetual resignation... all this can only be met by religion."  Crocker says that in this Napoleon "Sounds like a father of the church." -He is against the rule of secular law: "Every recourse to the law and courts is a calamity."  -He justifies the inquisition, which I'll admit makes some sense in terms of putting the inquisition into context.  But he steps over the line when he says on page 392 that if the inquisition had not been stopped, the Holocaust would have never happened.   -He barely mentions other Church sponsored sins, like the selling of indulgences.  These are but a few of the serious issues that I had with this book.  I truly hope that most Catholics do not believe in Crocker's history, because it is not a history.  A history needs to be objective.  Crocker denies any progress made in modern times and prefers a return to the injustices of monarchy.  Ultimately, the hisotry of the Catholic church is worth studying.  There is no doubt that it has had a profound impact on the world.  But the history of the Catholic church is really just like the rest of the world- a history of politics and power- gaining power, extending it, and not letting any other religious groups have any access to it.  There have been very good catholics, there have been very bad catholics, just as can be said for every other gorup of people. Don't believe the propaganda.   If you must read this book, please, please read it with a large grain of salt 
 While "Kill 'Em All" may have started the thrash genre, its not that good of an album.  James's vocals are pretty bad and his lyrics are very, very cheesy; and his songwriting isn't very organized.  While I don't really care about production, this album isn't that heavy.  The only redeeming parts of this album are Dave Mustaine's insane guitar solos and Cliff Burton's basslines.  The only good songs on here are "Hit the Lights," "The Four Horsemen," and "Anestesia;" everything else is skippable.  If you want the only other thrash album of 1983, go for Slayer's "Show No Mercy;" that album has way better song writing, way better vocals, and way heavier music.  Heck, Slayer's been kicking Metallica's kiester since day one! 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 This book is a supreme example of why editors are necessary. The English language in it is so poor that the mathematics suffers greatly. Typos, run on words, misspellings, mixed tense, lack of articles, lack of possessive markings, etc. abound on just about every page. If you know the subject you might be able to struggle through it. If you don't, then the confusion caused will leave you lost without a life raft. This review is based on the paperback reprint of 2003. Choice in offering a review saying this is "well-written" must have been reviewing the original in Chinese. Not recommended in any way 
 First of all I want to say that I am a true JB fan. I have learned all his horn lines ( trumpet ). Any band I play with, must play some James. This cd has lost the "fat sound" that he carried for years. His bass player, Fred Thomas, told me that he suggested to James to keep the music in the pocket but James didn't listen. Well this cd proves it. The sound is very thin and not the typical James Brown. I must be critical because I started listening to James in 1959. I always wanted to play in his band but the Air Force got me first.   Respectfully, Chuck Kin 
 Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously.  About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films 
 Oh Nicholson Baker, just when I'm about to crown you my favorite and grudgingly pass all of your books along to my best friends, I read "A Box of Matches," a novel which is less novel than a writing exercise legitimized as literature by a printer. I was shocked by "VOX" and fawned over "The Fermata," I even loved "Double Fold," his non-fiction turn on the assault on paper.  But this book will make most of you feel like you are wasting your time.  A man wakes up every morning around five, lights a match, and thinks.  That's it.  His thoughts range from piquant to gross to nostalgic to melancholy.  I'm not the kind of reader to expect world-changing events to take place in my literature.  But I do like to care about my characters -- and this guy didn't cut it.  Pick up one of Baker's other, more worthwhile books 
 After a fine opening, another look at adultery in academia, the plot goes crazy with a soul trapped in an emerald and a revolution on an island. Totally unbelievable. Silly dialogue. Where was the editor? Definitely this is one of the worst books I've ever read by an acclaimed author 
 I am being generous with my two stars, in deference to the man who wrote Harvest.  Simply put, Neil needs a lyricist, and perhaps a muse.  Listening to this, it seemed Neil looked around at what was clearly in view from his chair-his daughter, his guitar, his memory of the guy who sold him his ranch-came up with a tune and a hook, and then stuck with his first draft.  In acting, they call this mailing it in, and Neil mailed these lyrics in-or at least that's the better view to the one that suggests he has become lyric-deaf after all his years.  This could've been a four.  It just needed some words 
 I don't care about "the artist's intent" in this instance...the UK version of this album is vastly inferior to the U.S. release. I pined for years and years to get the U.S. "Mr. Fantasy" on CD, and my wait was finally rewarded a few years back with the reissue entitled "Heaven Is in Your Mind" (which was the original title of the U.S. release of this album...I've actually seen a copy so-titled on LP, though "Mr. Fantasy" was the more common release).  Never mind that this one has "Paper Sun" as a bonus track...the U.S. version leads off with it and has a much more sensible sequence overall, and the reissue puts the duff tracks from the UK version (e.g. "Utterly Simple") at the end where they can be avoided.  The only virtue this release would have would be the mono mixes, which are probably quite different from the stereo ones as was so often the case in those days.  This has always been one of my favorite albums of all time, but as Stevie says in "Smiling Phases," "Do yourself a favor"...get the U.S. one 
 I purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ag 
 This CD isn't bad, just not of thunderstorms. It is a cd of rainshowers with some thunder. The constant rain sounds more like static, like when your cable goes out. I was disappointed 
 I couldn't get past Chapter 6. Abbie is pathetic. Just when you think you have her figured out, something will be stated that completely changes your perception of her. However, that statement never has basis anywhere else in the book, and doesn't fit in with Abbie's personality. The book itself is not very funny, and not at all a gripping read. I do not recommend it 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 "A Death in Belmont" is a misleading untruthful exploitation of a murder which took place in 1963.  The new paperback version of the story is identical to the hardcover.  THE FACTS On March 11, 1963 Roy Smith was sent to the Goldberg home by the Division of Employment Security, a state employment agency, as a day worker to clean the house.  The interviewer at the agency, Mrs. Martin, later testified that she thought she had smelled liquor on Smith's breath.  When she asked him if he had been drinking, he replied, "No" and took a step back.  Smith was given an identification card and instructions to 14 Scott Rd., Belmont.   Although three witnesses testified that Smith arrived at the Goldberg home between 12:45 and 1:00 p.m. Smith told police he had arrived before noon.  Smith told police he knew he had left the Goldberg home at about 3:45 because the clock at the nearby pharmacy where he stopped to buy cigarettes read "quarter to four". Neighborhood children coming home from school at 3:05 p.m. saw Smith walking quickly away from Scott Road. Witnesses at the pharmacy testified that Smith made his purchase shortly after 3:00.   Smith told police he had finished the cleaning, left the house in order and had been paid $6.30 ($1.50 per hour for four hours plus 30 cents for transportation).    When Mr. Goldberg arrived home at 3:50 he found his wife's body and quickly called the police.  The house was in disarray.  Only one room (the sunroom) of the three rooms Smith claimed to have cleaned was actually in good order.  The police found that the living room was in the process of being cleaned, as most of the furniture was in the middle of the room, the couch was pushed to one corner, living room ornaments were on the dining room table and the vacuum cleaner, with attachments was in the center of the room. Alfred King of the Belmont Police Department stated, "A broom with a cloth over the broom end was at the entrance." Evidence from [350 Mass. 600] COMMONWEALTH vs. ROY SMITH.   On page 54 Junger states, "Smith was refusing to admit to the murder, but neither could the police catch him in a significant lie."  On page 256 Junger says, "The cops wanted to know what time he left the Goldberg house, and he told them the truth."  "The fact is he never lied about what he did that day."  1.	Smith lied about his time of arrival at 14 Scott Road (never mentioned in book)  2.	Smith lied on two occasions about his time of departure from 14 Scott Road. He spent two hours at the Goldberg home instead of the four he had claimed. (Smith lied on this point immediately after his arrest in Cambridge and again when interrogated in Belmont)   3.  	Smith lied when he told police the house had been cleaned and everything was in order. (never mentioned in the book)  4.	Smith told police he had been paid $6.30 at a rate of $1.50 per hour.  Had Mrs. Goldberg been alive when he left he would have been paid for only two hours or $3.00. (Smith lied on this point immediately after his arrest in Cambridge and again when interrogated in Belmont.)  5.	Smith's handprints were found on the vacuum cleaner, the living room mirror and the mantel over the fireplace.  Smith said he never touched the mirror or the mantel. (Smith's lie omitted from book)  Before Mr. Goldberg left for work he gave his wife a ten dollar bill and five singles to pay the cleaning man.  The day before, March 10th, he had left her $7.00, but she had not spent all of it.  Smith told police he had $2.00 with him when he arrived in Belmont and he had been paid $6.30.  When Smith was arrested on March 12th he had in his possession $3.20.  Using Smith's statements to the police and the testimony of his friends during the trial it was clear that Smith spent approximately $15.00 between the time he left Belmont and the next day when he was arrested.  A salesman at a liquor store testified he saw Smith with a ten dollar bill, a five dollar bill and some singles on March 11th.  Smith could not account for the $15.00 he spent plus the $3.20 found on his person.  Smith spent the evening of March 11th drinking with friends in Cambridge.  Smith's friends offered to drive him to his home in Boston.  As the car slowed down in front of Smith's apartment house Smith noticed two plainclothesmen. Smith told the driver to "speed up".  After some drinks at a nearby bar Smith's friends once again attempted to drive him home.  They all returned to Cambridge after Smith told them, "Go faster, they are still here."  Smith spent the night in Cambridge with his friends.   He was arrested in Cambridge on March 12, 1963.  Smith was tried for 1st degree murder, rape and larceny in November, 1963. He was convicted of murder and robbery, but acquitted of rape. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated the day before the jury retired to reach a verdict.    
 If you're interested in this topic and want to read an entertaining yet expert presentation of it go directly to Thomas Kida's new book, "Don't Believe Everything You Think" instead.  Or, even better, Thomas Gilovich's "How What Know What Isn't So," or, for a more technical than popular account, Scott Plous' book on judgment and decision-making.  Fine's book is too talky, filled to the brim with tedious anecdotes, and lacking any reference to the real research that has gone into the results that she superficially presents.  Ironic that she glosses over evidence and proof that are necessary for clear and critical thinking while at the same time attempting to describe the phenomena that often cloud our thinking rationally!  Maybe this would be appropriate for 10-12 year-olds but certainly is far below the level of adults who'd like some real information on the subject 
 Replaced first spindle and still junk. Will always stick with Verbatim from now on 
 I have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst. I couldn't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on it. They literally stole scenes from Runaway Train in this. Not the ideas, they stole the filmed scenes. The train kept going from one engine to the four in RT. The continuity was a joke. Had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem. Seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up 
 This book contains SOME very good information. Overall, I am glad to have purchased it for some of the information it contained. However, the author repeats himself constantly. Sometimes he changes the wording and sometimes he doesn't bother, he just repeats himself. If I could count the number of times he claims that things don't exist, and that every perceived thing is a concept, I'd guess it to be near one hundred.  Toward the end this book becomes even more weird and reundant as he attempts to tell you that the book you hold in your hand isn't really a book. He uses a graphic illustration about a cow, and none of us have even been able to see the cow in the picture he's talking about.  You may find some useful tips, but this can be a very boring read in places, and if you're like me you will be frustrated with the redundancy and all the concepts that seem to go nowhere... 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 Many reviewers compared this novel to Jurassic Park, saying it was a better book than Crichton's. What absurdity. I am not saying that JP is an awesome book, but it was far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon.  Tyrannosaur Canyon is a fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and VERY poorly ended. It's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in, and didn't know how to do it. The ending is too fast, too unlikely and too unrealistic.  The book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters, which I believe is Preston's way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science AND being religious.  Overall, I had high hopes for this book and I am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, I was greatly let down  
 Hello, my name is Joyce Carol Oates, and in every bookstore in the world, I must occupy at least two shelves for myself. JCO has never written anything of real insight in her life. She is wordy, PC, dull, and overly prolific, not because she has good ideas, but because her ideas are shallow and therefore she can use lots and lost of pages to say what good writers could do in 2 sentences. In just this year, she has published 3 books. And the year isn't over yet. This book in particular is bloated and dull. End of story. "Blonde" is a terrible PC piece of dreck claiming for 700 plus pages of very small print, how Marylin Monroe was a misunderstood brilliant genius. WOW. Let me tell you something- if you keep having to say it over and over again to yrself, maybe you'll come to believe it. Genius. Right. Right up there with Picasso and Newton and Homer and whoever else. JCO writes so much, you just want her to go away- she is desperately trying to find something to keep her name in print in 100 yrs, because she must know she don't got it and she won't last. Quantity doesn't mean quality. She is very sloppy and there isn't anything she could possibly offer on the technique of writing, other than just having diarreah of the typewriter/laptop. Don't buy this book folks. Okay, I feel better now. phew 
 This movie freely abuses the name of an ancient emperor of India while peddling a low-brow bollywood song-and-dance entertainer. This is neither the story of Ashoka nor reflective of any sort of history. Shah Rukh Khan for all his merits as an actor simply does not fit and the whole Kareena Kapoor cavorting in wet clothes is so over the top as to make one cringe. Best avoided 
 If you are reading these in order, this one is anticlimatic! you know that they are going to be together and the back story is horrible.  I really enjoyed the first 3, but the stories are becoming so much the same that I am giving up on this series!  I enjoyed sherrilyn kenyon's series so much more (which is also a little repetitve), but better written.  Christine really needed an editor to get rid of the same old statements over and over again AND to speed up the boo 
 I have seen 3 other Cirque's, Mystere (fantastic), O (great) and the one in Orlando (Okay). This one was a total disappointment. It was all about smoke, grunts, lights and the stage. In fact, the stage was the star of the show.  There were NO breathtaking acts like the other shows. The music was canned, not live. The only "performances" were a baton twirler (very lame .. better ones at high school football games), two guys who ran on the outsides of two rotating wire cages (okay but not really Wow!), and an aerial act that was so so.  At $150 per ticket I feel totally ripped off 
 Interesting that the book is the same as all other marketing books.  Same ole, same ole.  As I read, it seemed like I was reading a hodge podge of all the ideas that have been in print for years.  Putting them all in one book, claiming "different", flys in the face of the subject matter.  Not for me 
 Bought and returned this oven.  It took over 6 minutes to toast 2 slices of bread. I cant wait that long in the morning.  The toast it made was ok, not great, a little underdone  on the bottom side, but not worth waiting 6 + minutes for toast.  The oven part might work great, but if you want to make toast, this cant replace your toaste 
 I found that the author's philosophical ramblings were as uninformative as they were boring. I recommend this book to those suffering from insomnia 
 Disappointing at best  I was truly disappointed in this item. After purchasing it we followed the directions  for conditioning the non-stick grids both before using it for the first time as well as  before each use as listed in the "use and care guide."  It sounds simple enough. Wait for the green indicator light to come on, add the batter close but do not latch the lid. The green light will go off, when it comes back on the waffle is ready. The only problem is the waffles were burnt and were stuck to the lid as though glued in place with epoxy glue. The waffles ripped into pieces when trying to get them loose from the maker and they also tasted like burnt toast crusts.  We said  "Well, OK, maybe it just needs a couple of waffles cooked in it  before they start to come out right."  7 sheets of waffles later they were still coming out as bad as the first.   The price is great, the design is nice, the over all appearances are wonderful but it simply does not work, at least not for us.   I told my wife I would take it back to the store and exchange it. She said, "don't you dare bring another one of those things home with you."   It's to bad too, we both love waffles.  
   The only problem is even though it's only a penny you'd still have to pay $2-$3 shipping. Not worth it! Funny book written by a sweaty little fat kid with crazy Christian conservative parents. Hearing a 14 year old virgin boy's opinion on abortion is great. And it's all yours for only one penny 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 White-washed with a heavy coat of feminist wistfull thinking, "Missing Mary" is a New Age fictional concoction at best and outright heresy at worst.  Spretnak blatantley lies when she states that Mary's presense in Catholic theology has been "played down" from the pulpit by decree of Vatican II.  Never has the church made any official statement that Marian statues were to be removed from churches and that prayer to Mary and the Rosary be given a kind of Protestant-like boot out the door.  One need only look at the papacy of John Paul II and his devotion to the Blessed Mother to see that Spretnak's assumptions are completely false.  Pope John Paul even put "M" in his coat of arms to represent Mary and he credits her with saving his life after the assassination attempt on his life.  While Spretnak was "missing Mary" in her particular church there were plenty of other churches where Marian devotions continued unabated.  Too bad she never found one, but it does not justify her shoddy research and false accusations.  Spretnak quotes theologically fuzzy Catholics like Matthew Fox and Andrew Greeley and she constantly slams Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) in the typical liberal dissendent-catholic manner.    But it's when Spretnak starts to ascribe pagan "Goddess" qualities to Mary that she goes out on a limb and saws it off.  Never in the church's history has Mary been portrayed as a goddess, a near-goddess or "the Goddess."  She is Theotokis, the "light bearer" meaning that she carried the light (Jesus Christ) in her womb.  Mary is the Mother of the Church, given to the Church by Christ as he was being crucified ("Son, behold your Mother").  She is the Ark of the New Covenant and she leads her children to Christ as any good mother does, but she is not a Goddess to be worshipped and the church has never taught that she should be worshipped, only venerated because she is the first Christian and a perfect Christian.  Mary was never GONE from the Church. She doesn't have to make a COMEBACK. Mary was never minimalized or whatever cockamaymie words Spretnak uses.   
 I originally purchased this HDTV back in September but it had to be replaced because the digital tuner(ATSC) was defective and the ATSC would crash while i was watching digital TV so the picture would freeze and i would have to restart the TV to watch digital TV.   Olevia replaced that defective tv with a new tv same model and it worked fine for about 2 months now it has an unsightly thin vertical blue line going threw the middle of the screen. So now olevia has to replace my tv for a second time in 6 months. I've never experienced such poor quality electronics in my life and I will never buy another product from olervia-syntax. I would give this product 0 stars if i could. DONT buy this (...). 
 A number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The plot is disjointed and confusing; jumping from the North African Theatre to the European Theatre almost seamlessly, leaving the viewer thoroughly confused.  The character development is also very poor.  No one character stands out due to the fact that Samuel Fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue.  Historically speaking this film is a joke.  During the action scenes when the Germans have tanks they are in fact American tanks with the German symbol painted on.  Also, uniforms are sometimes inaccurate.  However, the most annoying aspect is the fact that Samuel Fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the ONLY squad fighting the entire war.  Only once or twice do you see any other American troops.  This feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war, of which these men are supposed to be a part of.  Finally, to make matters worse, the film's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical, sloppy, awkwardly placed, and consist of ridiculous situations.    Overall this movie was too long, lacked character development for most of the movies characters, was disjointed, and was historically inaccurate.  For a movie that garnered so much hype I was expecting much, much more.   
 The concept of whole language when implemented in California in the 80s was a total debacle and I see that there are still books out there promoting the "whole" concept, only this time it is in math.  Use this book only in addition to tried and proven ways of teaching math 
 I thought this book would give objective advice on how much insurance someone should buy. It told me a few things I didn't know but I wouldn't have paid the price for the book for two or three pages of useful advice 
 Philosophical musing of hard core materialistic reductionist, incapable of open-mindedness to overcome blindness of shortsighted old-paradigm scientific dogmas, thus incapable to see a revolutionary "big picture", which is offered by cutting-edge scientific discoveries of our days in the fields of quantum physics, epigenetics, neurobiology, neurosociology, social and emotional intelligence, etc., etc., etc. This book gives no articulated, nor substantiated answer to the question it claims to give, just contributes to mental confusion and emotional illiteracy. Enlightenment is something the author would NEVER enjoy... Waisted time and money for those readers, who could sense the historical merger of all scientific disciplines and ancient wisdom we are witnessing now. 
 For any number of reasons I can probably say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that a lot of people think this is genius. I am not one of them. Personally, I don't find endless descriptions of sex with minority boys to be very entertaining reading, let alone genius. I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.  This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.  This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the "naked" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future. Who reads this and resonates with it? Who thinks, "Yes, gay sex with boys is what my mind is all about? Oh, and all the better that they're Arabs!" Very few people, the author included. Burroughs himself admits this was difficult to write. This is probably due to the fact that the vignettes portrayed here do not, in fact, represent anything so much as the anarchy resplendent in the author's own mind while he struggled with various addictions. As a case study in heroin and morphine addiction, this may have some merit. As a counterculture commentary on society I find it worthless.  This isn't about my sensibilities being assaulted - far from it. If I can read & enjoy Robbins's linguistic forays into sex with nuns, I can handle just about anything. I'm not offended with flying sperm so much as I am insulted that anyone felt this was worth reading; that I was lured into thinking this was a work of art. It's not.   Sometimes I read books that don't suit me, but I understand why someone would like it. This book falls squarely in the camp where people feel they need to proclaim it genius because they're so confused or intimidated by it. This book is far from genius. The author admits it was put together from scraps of things written while he was in his heavy heroin addiction, and that he vaguely remembers much of it. I don't see how, or in what context, this book will appeal to anyone other than a case study of a certain segment of people at a certain instance in time in America 
 When I first got the book I thought it was basic Tagalog, but it wasn't. This book is for people that know some Tagalog. It was very hard to use for learning the language. Not a good book for beginners 
 Having lived in Japan for a long time I found this book disappointing. As another reader stated above it is written from a man's perspective and experiences in Japan.  I had a hard time relating to much of his book. Alan writes for the gaijin man in Japan. I know if a gajin woman were to repeat his journey the tale would be much different. I am sure many long-timers would agree 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 If you are looking for useful information to cooking questions you've always wondered about, look elsewhere.  Harold McGee's "On Food & Cooking" and Shirley Corriher's "Cookwise" are both full of useful and interesting stuff.  Wolke tries to be cute, and some may like his sophomoric style, but I couldn't get past the first chapter.  Now who do I know who is dumb enough to like this drivel 
 This movie is composed of quick glimpses, not scenes, and consists mostly of talk.  There is virtually no action of any kind in this four-and-a-half hour movie.    The funeral at the end is as perfunctory as everything else.  Contrary to the product description, there is no story of a reunion of characters at the funeral.  Mostly, they appear driving their various cars to the funeral and, like a chorus, commenting on and explaining the actions that we have just been shown.    The nasty-surprise ending gives a clue as to why the author may have written this book--to gloat over the sexual prowess of one of the characters.  Most viewers will find this revelation repulsive.  If you make a guess as to why the author wrote such a story and then read the Mary Wesley biographical summary included with this DVD, you'll probably find your guess vindicated.  Viewers who do not share her prejudices will not enjoy this movie.    Some of the "characters" like the twins and Walter are merely ciphers, not characters at all, not even caricatures.  All the characters with the exception of Sophie are sociopaths.  It's true that there are sociopaths in the world, but they are relatively rare (at least they were rare in the past).  There is not a shred of humanity in any of these people.  Some, I suppose, are intended to be "quirky", but quirky does not have to be infuriating or obnoxious.  The entire movie is an exhibition of contempt for human beings or at least contempt for the British upper-middle class.  No doubt there are people who will agree with this assessment.  They should enjoy this movie.    Unlike other period movies, WWII is merely a device in this movie.  It plays almost no role and hardly appears, except as drawn curtains, taped windows and some sound effects.  The war seems to mean little to most of the characters.  A couple of times, someone mourns for a dead cousin; but since there was no evidence of positive regard between them before, the mourning hardly has any effect on the audience.    Even the sex scenes are too cold-blooded to be erotic scenes, let alone love scenes.  People casually hop into bed with no evidence of desire or other positive feelings.  Consequently, they are ineffective as cinema.    The music is appropriate: all spikes, quirks, jerks and plucked strings.    I can't believe that the amazon reviewer actually watched this movie.  His statements sound more like promotional material for the movie than like a review.  
 Bringing out some sort of "Tribute to Paris Hilton" song by simply covering an old song and giving a ragga feel to it - is SIMPLY BORING. So far Stefani did not convince me as a solo artist. it's all high marketin 
 Songs like this are nothing but desperate last ditch attempts at making a few dollars before people forget who you are. All anyone ever knew Shakira for was her hips and her stripper style dancing, so what does she do? Releases a song about that exact attribute and plays on that single attribute like there's no tomorrow. This song is equivalent to J-Lo releasing a song in 5 years about her huge butt after she's all washed up and everyone has forgot about her.  Truth be told the hips DO lie, the hips are so full of bs it's not even funny... It's gotten so bad she cant even sing any more, so they digitize her voice Cher style and feature some poser mainstream idiot like Wyclef who hasn't done anything even half decent since the Soul Assassin days.   We're all waiting for Shakira's money to dry up and for her to do Playboy then fall off the face of the earth. Hurry up already 
 Suggesting that the author only tacked on UML and C++ to make more money is a little misguided.  I dont think the book delivers what it promises - C++ and UML - but implying the author (a college professor) did something  for money was a little dumb 
 MY SON RECENTLY GOT THE MOVIE PLAYER JR FOR CHRISTMAS. TODAY IS HIS BIRTHDAY AND FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS I HAVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR NEW MOVIES BECAUSE HE IS BORED WITH THE ONES THAT CAME WITH IT. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED TO HEAR THAT SO MANY OTHER PARENTS OUT THERE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. IF I HAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN I WOULDNT HAVE WASTED MY MONEY AND RENTED THE CLIFFORD MOVIES ELSEWHERE. 
 Immortel (ad vitam) (Enki Bilal, 2004)  While I was not overly impressed with Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy on the page, I figured a film made out of it could be a pretty fun ride, and with Bilal himself at the helm, I had high hopes for it. Most of them, unfortunately, were dashed in the first few minutes.  The one thing everyone agrees on is that the film looks quite nice. And it does-- some of the CGI faces are so realistic they put me in mind of the best scenes in the Final Fantasy film. And the integration of actual actors and CGI characters is often seamless. The "sets," though, are second-rate Bladerunner wannabes. There was a lot of potential in them, and most of it was wasted.  The acting, even when delivered by some pretty high-powered acting talent (Charlotte Rampling, for example), is atrocious. The two main actors, Linda Hardy (who, aside from this, has yet to land a major role) and Thomas Kretschmann (soon to be seen  in the film adaptation of The Celestine Prophecy) are both wooden. Rampling injects a touch of vivacity into her role now and then, but it's not nearly enough.  The plot is... well, I can definitively say there is a plot. And that it is, in fact, connected to the Nikopol Trilogy in some way. But when you don't meet the character of Nikopol until half an hour into a hundred-minute film, that should tip you off that things aren't staying completely faithful to the book. There are scenes you'll recognize, if you've read the Nikopol Trilogy, but I can tell you from experience: having read it does not make this movie any more lucid. In fact, it may add to the confusion.  In short, aside from the visually appealing aspect, I can't find a single thing about this movie to recommend to, well, anyone.  
 If your main objective, is the study of human relationships, social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing other people, this movie is for you.  Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just, a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script with people, relationships, seduction, etc.   This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true. Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more fun for some people than others 
 This film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave. I originally saw it for free and afterwards, I still felt screwed. It stank so badly that I checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre. Yeah, I know. Call me "Mister Tact".  A "horror-comedy" that's neither slightly funny nor remotely scary, this film is a supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic "An American Werewolf in London", (which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made). The filmakers had a lot to live up to and, boy, they blew it in every department. The effects were ludicrous, the cast was lost, the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues, and the director should have been shot (with something other than lots of narcotics). This film is a textbook example of the Hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew.  If you have already been suckered into buying this DVD, I feel your pain. You are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a Heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack 
 Give me a break,people!All Spin Magazine is a cheap rip-off/wanna-be of Alternative Press.I've looked at like maybe ten OR less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years.Think I may've saved ONE of those issues.Sometimes,I'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that's been left behind.I'll then take it home,then likely toss it out after I've looked through it twice.Avoid at all costs 
 Whew!  It's a good thing David Mills has set us all straight about everything from the police, to chiropractors, to schools, to God.  My question is, why did he feel the need to write this book?  It reads like a teenager going through their rebellious stage.  
 I hate to jump on the bandwagon of all those who dislike Sandra Lee's approach to cooking.  I'm an avid watcher of most programs on the Food Network and while Lee is not my favorite chef, I find her entertaining and relaxing to watch on weekends.  Many criticize her because she isn't cooking, she just mixes up pre-packaged foods filled with sodium, fat, and preservatives to make mediocre concoctions that look and smell better than they taste.  I really wanted to like this book.  I flipped through the pages and saw the great explanation of slow cooking techniques and the beautiful full-color photos.  The book didn't seem overly-reliant on pre-packaged foods and I figured it would be a great guide for my new slow cooker.  This book has let me down.  I made the "Easiest Ever Paella" and it took twice the stated amount of time to cook and when it was done the rice was a gooey mess (consistency of old oatmeal or grits), the rice stuck to the bottom of the Crock Pot, and the dish was too salty for my palate.  On a second try I made the White Chili and it was mediocre.  I let it cook on low all day while I was at work and when I served it the beans were mushy and the flavor wasn't as full as I expected.  Did anybody test any of these recipes?  Where is she getting the food in the pictures?  The food I made looked absolutely nothing like the pics.  I'm giving this book 2 stars because the layout is nice and the pictures are great.  If you use some of the tips from the first section of the book, you can probably modify some of the recipes and save them from disaster.  My biggest criticism of Lee is that she assumes that her readers are too busy to even chop an onion, so she suggests using pre-chopped frozen onions.  Some of the ingredients in her book are difficult to find (or discontinued).  It often costs four times more to buy pre-prepared food than to spend ten extra minutes and do it from scratch.  If you want to cook fast, I suggest Rachel Ray's books.  She may have an annoying, goofy personality, but at least she cooks from scratch.  Her recipes haven't let me down yet 
 This CD is "A Decade of Steely Dan" only they took out "St. Louis Toodle-oo and replaced it with "Dirty Work"- great song- and added a song each from their 90's releases "Two Against Nature" and Everything Must Go". If you really want a comprehensive collection w/out having to buy the box set or all of the albums separately, go buy the 2 cd Showbiz Kids collection fom a few years back 
 I bought this book because the blurb on the back cover appealed to me--young aspiring writer dumps cheating boyfriend and starts living life her way rather than trying to please others.    SPOILERS ahead.  Instead, I got Trina, a spineless cipher of a character who doesn't have any clear personality traits even after a couple hundred pages, who dumps her cheating boyfriend, dates a couple of insipid other guys, and deals with all work and home situations by putting her head in the sand.  Then cheating boyfriend comes back and has the gall to get mad that she was involved with other guys while they were broken up--and she doesn't even call him on the carpet for it--and then makes an unreasonable demand of her.  And she caves.  I don't like to write negative reviews, since I know they're hurtful to authors, but this book just ticked me off.  Between the main plot and the subplot involving Trina's sister, it seemed like the author's point was "Settle down with the first guy who claims to love you.  You'll never find anyone else, and he'll only cheat on you a little bit."  Ugh 
 I read this book on the suggestion of Thom Hartmann, author of "The Prophet's Way", "Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight", "ADD Success Stories" and several other Great books. B. M. Hubbard has some  really good ideas, but rarely speaks from the standpoint of authority. She  uses quotes from other books an average of two times every three pages,  which gives the impression that she isn't comfortable just saying  "what is so", or she isn't sure that what she KNOWS is right. So  while the ideas are of the same caliber as other books of this kind, the  writing left me feeling like I just finished a discussion with a  proslytizing religionist, who attempts to convert other people as a  stop-gap measure for her own insecurity. I am not so naive to suggest that  no-one should read this book, as I am sure that my own personal filters  have something to do with the bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps I have missed  something that you will find 
 Possibly the most boring, pointless book I've ever read (and I do read a lot) - - no flow, not interesting, and the book does a dis-service to a fascinating town, despite the un-fascinating "celebrity" stories that Mr. Leavitt goes on and on and on about .. 
 This is a waste of money. Garmin wants you to spend up to $100.00 for a map that will give you any information. If you need a basic map, save your money, stop at a rest area and get a free one 
 I was excited to see what all the fuss was about after hearing about kettlebells and what an effective training tool they are.  However, after  reading this book it was evident that it is incomplete and poorly conceived, of poor quality and lacking in too many areas to be taken seriously.  (Also, it has since been superceded by "Enter the Kettlebell" in which Pavel contradicts himself.)  I was confused by the many typographical errors with whole paragraphs being repeated out of sequence in non-related chapters and the lack of photographs required to do a good job of conveying how to properly execute the various movements.  This could be quite dangerous for the trainee who doesn't have the time, money or inclination to spend $1500-2000 to take a beginners kettlebell course.  Surely this must be a Russian plot to bilk hard-working Americans out of their money and send them on a mission of useless training programs?  I got the distinct impression that Pavel's books are written in serial fashion to either 1) convince you that you MUST take a "certified" kettlebell course or (2) get you to buy more expensive books or (3)get you to buy expensive DVD's.  "Take down that wall Gorby"...so those wacky Russians can experience the American dream by selling over-hyped books supposedly containing valuable Russian training "secrets".  As much as the kettlebell "cultists" would like you to believe how great they are, fortunately most of us are not confined to a Russian gulag or currently in exile in Siberia working out with balls of iron with a handle in the sub-freezing cold, performaing boring, mind numbing endless repetitions of snatches and swings.  No, here in America, a long time ago, someone came up with the idea of ADJUSTABLE dumbells and barbells with which you can progressively add weight and thereby grow in strength and muscularity.  Plenty of trainees around the world have built great physiques and strength without ever having touched a kettlebell.  Keep that in mind and try to see past the hype 
 Dillard's work is poetic, but her conclusions troubling.  She tries to form a redemptive narrative of material that cannot be answered by this simplistic approach.  For example, she addresses a young girl who has been  badly burned, telling the girl that she has become a nun in her suffering,  that she will learn something, that it won't take this young girl as long  to come to the same realizations that she, Dillard herself, has reached.   This seems a hubris of the most disturbing kind, to use the suffering of  another to say "now you'll know what I've known," when it's  entirely questionable whether or not Dillard can claim this kind of  suffering.  Or, even if she can, that she attempts to instruct another in  the realm of what lies beyond instruction.  Dillard's thoughts are worth  reading, but they also require a careful questioning, as her assumptions  are sometimes highly problematic 
 I AM A BIG FAN OF THIS SERIES AND HAVE READ THE BOOKS TWICE...ALL BUT THIS ONE. I WISH I HAD NOT EVEN READ IT ONCE AS THE SO CALLED "TWISTS" IN IT DEALING WITH BILL AND ERIC DO NOT FIT IN WITH THE REST OF THE SERIES AND LEFT ME FEELING TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH MS. HARRIS'S PLOT. IT WAS JUST PLAIN NOT FUN 
 Before you devote a lot of time reading his work, you ought to look up Reich's biography on Wikipedia.  He was incredibly prolific and is notable for having written against Fascism and come out against Communism long before it was fashionable.  He is also known for inventing the infamous "orgone box" and ending his days in jail for medical quackery and a remarkably incompetent defense.  His work is dense and inadvertently thought provoking, but mostly manic and meaningless.  It should be preserved, but not widely read 
 The organization of this book is very confusing.  After chapters giving a pep talk, the author discusses riding in general, then gives just one basic chapter on Western and then English riding.  I never knew quite where I was.  The author brings up terms without defining them, and finally, some sentences are almost incomprehensible, requiring several readings.  For example try to figure out "posting."  And I still don't know what this sentence means:  "In other words, if you are riding around the arean to the left, with rail on your right side and the middle of the arena on your left side, your horse should take the left lead, so that it can canter comfortably to the left while curved, or 'bent' slightly to the left.&quot 
 I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was.  All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore 
 This book has the noblest of intentions, and I cannot fault either its authors or the women they interviewed for trying to help men understand women better. Unfortunately, a better title for it would be "What Some Women Want Men To Think They Want", because the book's approach to answering its title question is flawed. It assumes that women say what they mean, especially when they are told that their responses will be read by an audience they hope to influence for their own ends. And it assumes that women themselves know just what they want, which few of us, male or female, actually do (when I mentioned this book to a female friend, she asked me to let her know what women wanted when I was through reading it, because she and all her female friends had no idea).  That is not to say that the book is devoid of helpful advice, because there is some good stuff here, particularly that given in the "Can She Ex?lain It" sections. Kate Fillion's contribution, for example, which pointed out the impossible standard women today are called upon to meet, was fascinating and eye-opening. But in general the quality of advice in "What Women Want" varies widely; the emphasis on respect and communication can only help men in marriages or other committed relationships, but the advice on how to meet and court women is useless in the extreme and could well be read as advice for men on how NOT to get a date (though celibate guys can use it to make female friends who will see them as one of the girls).  There is a further flaw that must be mentioned: it is clear that the authors do not understand men, for this book assumes that all men are the same and want the same things. Even as it attempts to convince men of the complexity of women, it ignores the fact that men are no less varied, which diminishes its value for much of its intended audience. The "guy-talk" tone is often irritating, and never helpful.  The greatest value of "What Women Want" does not lie in its advice but in its very failure to accomplish what it set out to do, and with a little digging we can see just why it all went so wrong. There is no doubt but that the women interviewed in this study thought they were answering the questions honestly, just as there is also no doubt that the behavior of women in the real world frequently does not match those answers. Part of the reason for this is, I believe, our society. America is the wealthiest nation in world history, and we are all, men and women alike, told by the mass media that our lives should be perfect and that there is something very wrong with us when they are not. Fantasy, not reality, dominates gender relations in America today, and this leads to unrealistic expectations about the behavior of our partners, even as the fantasy of perfection cripples our ability to communicate (if Leonardo DeCaprio and Jude Law don't have to have intimate talks with their lovers, why should we?). The comments in this book are a prime example: men must be perfect, like the heroes in romance novels (correctly called female porn by the authors), or they will be discarded and ridiculed. Many women, like many men, judge potential partners based on how well they match up to criteria developed in sexual fantasy, not reality, and so real partners will never measure up. And because society tells us daily that the "customer is always right", it makes sense that the women interviewed in "What Women Want" seem to feel that they bear no responsibility for their own happiness, as according to this book it is always men who must compromise, but never women.  Ultimately, then, "What Women Want" is largely a collection of demands and complaints made by members of a culture whose 50% divorce rate makes any comment by its members on gender relations suspect. It is also a very human and American book, because the often unrealistic demands made by women here are mirrored by the equally unrealistic demands so often made by men, and which, with the same sort of interviews, would no doubt come forth just as passionately and be just as pointless 
  Thousands of little girls, armed only with bamboo spears and knives , are able to overcome an army of thousands of adult, Chinese revolutionaries? Many of the men are killed, but not one of the little girls is hurt? Does this seem plausible? A large group of intelligent, well educated men and women copy the culture and social structure of Victorian England? Is this reasonable? Absurdities compounding absurdities throughout the book.   Protracted , boring sections detail Nell's Fairy Tale adventures seeking magical keys in different castles. Nell's fantasy adventures are the primer's method of teaching and helping Nell to become a young woman who can think for herself and survive in a hostile world. OK , but there was too much of this for my taste.  With the possible exception of Nell, the characters lacked depth, they didn't fully come alive for me. We need to learn more about them, their backgrounds and motivations.  There were some interesting descriptions of nanotechnology, individual atoms being assembled into microscopic machines. Matter compilers essentially give people everything they need instantly. How would such technology affect our lives and culture? This was thought provoking and is the reason I gave the book two stars instead of one. There is the potential for a very good book here, but this isn't it 
 i lie howard's stories. ut his "successors"..... Well, this could actually have been good. good descriptions and suspenceful at times. but there are too many pages where nothing happens. and it is not necessary to use so much time to explain the intrigue through lengthy dialogue, we get it. and towards the end, it doesn't deliver. the ending should have been better and more a natural link to the story 
 Hi,  I have used this book among others to get accepted to McKinsey (and with success) and I think this book gave me less then others.  The advantages are the more or less detailed frameworks chapter and the real-life interviews chapter, but the cases themselves are rather superficial and sometimes even obviously ridiculous(like for example the case in which a Star-Trek like omnipotent people transporter has been invented, and the book claims that it wouldn't replace cars because it costs 100,000$. Come on, they would buy one for every block). I think there are much better resources than this.  Good luck with your interviews 
 Hank obviously is unhappy with the emotionalism that comes with revival, healing, and signs and wonders. In reality many of the healing miracles done through the healing movement have scientific and medical proof.   That doesnt mean that the healers are not sinners just like you and me. It does not mean that the revivalists are not normal people. It just means that God works through real people to make miracles happen. Which sounds alot like the book of Acts. Hank probably wouldnt have been too comfy if he had been at Pentecost. 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 About 65% of the material is useless fluff. Authors try to be funny and silly.   I'm not an expert programmer. I took a few programming courses (C++) in college. It doesn't provide a good reference either.  If you prefer technical books to be to the point this book isn't for you. If you've tried other Java books and it didn't help I guess this one will not hurt.   It does have the information you need if you're willing to dig for it 
 The link says I've listened to THIS box set. WRONG! I'm sure that for some this will be enough BAD CO, but for me, no way. Recently, in the last two months, I've been looking far and wide, over hill and dale, for the definitive BAD CO. box. It's nowhere that I've looked. I have started buying the cd's individually that I owned on vinyl as a young man. My ex has them now. Weep. When the ORIGINAL Bad Co. albums come out in their ORIGINAL order as a box set, I'll buy it, and it will NEVER be opened, as I already have all these albums. Archiving for posterity is essential in our pre-apocalyptic world. Don't you think 
 I've enjoyed several Ludlum novels, but this one is very slow and it seems to be going almost no where. I'm half way through and don't see much point in going on except to make the most of money I spent for the CD version. It certainly isn't an action-packed thriller I was hoping for. I'd give it 5 stars for non-action and lots of meaningless "yadda, yadda, yadda" if such a category existed 
 In reading this book I became very disheartened in the way our society is going.  While I respect Dr. Dyson's view on allowing individuality and embracing our history, I find that he also allows for the acceptance of ignorance.    He also gives support to he refutes arguments based on research such as "being smart" as "being white".  What he should do is gather information from people who have been subjected to this experience.  I grew up in Detroit, MI in the 70's and 80's and now have an 8yr old nephew there, who is having the same experience of being called "white" because he's articulate and bright.    I understand his need to connect the gap between the older generation and the younger generation.  This is important, but not at the sacrifice of educating our youth.  I understand the use of slang, however there is a time and place for everything.  I understand there are different styles, however many of these same youths do not know how to dress during an interview, church service or in school for that matter, with dress codes.    He uses the example of the colorful array of suits and zoot suits in the early 1900's.  We have similar styles with the crayola colored styles that would not be acceptable in corporate America.  And that is okay.  However his attempt to compare the prison garb style to the previous styles is like comparing apples to oranges.  A zoot suit was compared to a conservative suit.  The prison garb should be compared to a simple pair of jeans with a belt.  The youth are not in "sympathy dress".  They are dressing in a trend with no meaning, only wanting to fit in.  Why not fit in with productive individuals vs. the prisoners?  We can romanticize about the so called martyr's of Tupac and Biggie Smalls as he has done in this book, but it takes away from those who are really trying to help the community and are gunned down or imprisoned.  Tupac and Biggie were about the dollar and that dollar caused them to hang around individuals who took things too far for that almighty dollar.    Most of his arguments sound like excuses.  I think we should embrace our youth and the poor.  However if they are taught as Dr. Dyson does in this book that you're okay where you are and with what you're doing, will they listen when someone is trying to teach them a way that can better their lives so they will no longer be poor.

 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 Leo the Late Bloomer occupies a dusty, terrifying shelf in one of the furthest reaches of my memory.    To a child who is already depressed and uncertain, Leo offers no solace.  I found him pathetic, and because I was like him, I found myself pathetic all the more.  Leo is the prisoner who escapes while the others languish.  He proves only that salvation is possible, but he offers no guidance for how it will come about.  It's nice for Leo that he "bloomed," but the child is still miserable.  You think I am kidding.  I wish I was.    I do not blame the book per se, though.  With kind, insightful parents, it could help a child talk about his hopes and dreams, and with their encouragement they might come true.  But read alone, on the floor of an otherwise empty room, with no one to translate the allegory, it only tightens the noose.  
 I bought 300 and 500 units. They are not working in my small condo. I cannot find the place to see how they finally work 
 Total waste of money, unless the only thing you want to do with this system is connect it to another Creative Labs product, like one of their PC cards. This system cannot be connected with anything else, be warned. 
 This book was a great book. I like the way Trent was helped by Nick. One thing I didn't like was the violence. I am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. I would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. That is what I thought about Night Hoops.      Sunny Block 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 Do NOT buy this book unless you speak Latin, French, German and already possess an advanced degree in history! There is not a single page in this book that doesn't contain a reference to an extremely obscure historical figure (for which no background or explanation is offered) or a competely baffling quote. Here is an example: "Recoiling before an appalling bibliography on the horseshoe which he had assembled, the most learned archaeologist in the field of the early Middle Ages, Dom Henri Leclercq, struck his colours, remarking: 'En ce qui regarde la ferrure des chevaux, nous laissons ce sujet a ceux qui ont des loisirs.'" Oh, MY! Simply scandalous! Stay away unless you enjoy this kind of pretense 
 I was hoping this would be another great book by Rylant, but I was shocked to find the cleverly woven references to homosexuality....this is a book for young readers...not appropriate 
 This is useless if you know any Spanish.  I thought it would contain idioms but this contains only the kind of information you'd need for simple travel.  Save your money 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 The flight into New York had been a long one; but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the airport.  She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer's Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author.  I quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her Mercedes S class sedan to the Waldorf Astoria downtown.  "I have to admit that I didn't you who you were until I read STARLESS GRASSLANDS.  I don't mean to embarrass you; but that book changed my life."  I tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment.  For the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while I approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile.  I very much approved of her legs.  As I departed the car, Kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes.  "Don't forget.  I'll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together.  Please be ready."  I expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp.  The hotel staff greeted me and soon I entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor.  As I entered the suite, the steward took my request to have my suit blushed, prepared and returned in a few hours.  Finally, a bit of peace.  I poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below.  For a few moments I contemplated the remarks I was to make at this evening's formal ceremonies, then I heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room.    I turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked Sandy Bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit.  "Well, Crabby, aren't you glad to see me?"  Before I could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right.  It was Jennifer Aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit.  "Sweetheart, don't look at her.  Come here to me."  "Get out!" screamed Sandy.    "No, you get out.  It's not fair.  I left Brad for him so I get him!"  The two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment.  Then Sandy leapt at Jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other.  It was a ferocious sight as pulled hair, shrieks of pain, and nylon tearing could be heard.  Then almost a quickly as it began, the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room.  Several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor.    Sandy marched back into the room victorious.  I ran to the door of the sitting room only to see Jennifer laid out on the floor out cold, spread eagle and naked.  Before I could think of what to do Sandy tapped me on my shoulder.  I turned around and there Sandy stood.  A little worse for wear.  Trying to catch her breath.  Nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet.  "Forget her.  She won't bother us now."  Sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face, smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume.  She posed standing and anticipating my admiration.    "Now I'm all sweaty and warm.  I need a shower."  Sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond.  I turned around and wondered what I should do for poor Jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor.  Then I heard Sandy calling.  "Crabby, why don't you come and help me?  You could soap up my......"   OOPS!!!!  Sorry!!!  Err...just a little fantasy of mine.  I meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over.  I swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here.  You see, the cover of this DVD displays Ms. Bullock prominently with her name in big font letters.  But in truth this movie focuses on Tate Donovan as the main character and only on Ms. Bullock as his unlikely love interest.  As much as I "love" Sandra Bullock, I have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her.  Her best films have been WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY and the much-unappreciated HOPE FLOATS.  Unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like FIRE ON THE AMAZON, HANGMAN, SPEED 2 and this movie.  The plot revolves around two "losers in love" who are unappealing both in looks and personality.  Donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman (an unrecognizable Anne Bancroft) and soon both Donovan and Bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet.  All goes well until others find out their secret and Donovan and Bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other.  The story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet.  Chances are you can find a copy of this DVD fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you're waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work-or your friends to wake up from their naps-so you can really do something worth wild. 
 I'm a huge fan of the DS9 relaunch, and I was eagerly anticipating this book as a continuation of the exciting storyline the various authors had established. However, after the great descriptions and plots of the previous books, especially the "Mission: Gamma" and "Worlds of DS9" series, I was very much disappointed by "Warpath". Like "Unity", the book does advance the plot, and provide some excellent action scenes, but not much else - it definitely does not share the depth and stand-alone nature of the other books. Furthermore, the author liberally reuses a number of plot ideas from previous Star Trek novels, such as the melodrama between Vaughn and Prynn, Ro and Quark. I also intensely disliked the ending, came totally out of nowhere, and didn't expand the DS9 universe at all, something the previous books were excellent at accomplishing. I hope the next installment follows the path established by the previous novels, instead of this new trend. 
 I think this book had a boring ending it ended as if it was a movie that was going to have a sequel to it. There was no point to the ending of the book. The only thing I liked about the book was that it showed that no matter what race anyone was they should get along. All in All this book did not interest me 
 Be careful all those who buy books based upon prepublication hype. This is not a book for the impatient reader. If you are fascinated by obscure 17th century mexican poets or fancy arcane Aztec culture  sprinkled with ancient Greek mythology, you'll probably enjoy this tome. Or those of you who enjoy a hodgepodge of literary genres, from magical realism to stream of consciousness ( a la Joyce) combined with Tolstoyan heft, get the book. I think this is one that will die on the vine, because most people, like me, will buy it and after the first three hundred pages, give up tyrying to muster some interest in the story (as it is presented) and ending up with a very effective doorstop. Suffice it to say that this could EASILY have been edited down to half its length. It's too bad because the author has talent that needs to be focused. (I don't know how he even finished this novel in twelve years with the life he's led!).  Take heed...this is not the kind of book that will suddenly snare you with interest after the first 200 or so pages 
 This book teaches people the unethical way to advertise on the internet - spamming.  Following these methods, at worse, will put you in legal trouble. At best, you will be making money unethically and making lots of people angry.  These stupid get rich quick internet schemes don't work anyways... don't waste your time or money 
 I received this coffee maker as a gift two years ago.  As a mechanical engineer, the machine itself makes my heart cry.  The parts are a flimsy plastic that have been cracking slowly but surely over time.  The pod holder is difficult to open and it feels like the handle will break if you push the end.  I haven't had any problems with leaking or lukewarm coffee; the coffee itself comes out hot and tastes good.  The only issue I've had is cracked parts 
 I think that Cole is trying to explain something big here. The book tackles a lot of big subjects under the heading of "nothing" and tries to prove that what Cole refers to as "nothing" is really where everything in the universe comes from. And I think it really hits the mark sometimes. But 95% of the book is semantics and wordplay. And I think the book really stretches to fit some things into the "nothing is everything" theory. You'll wait at least 50 pages before you start learning real science. It must have been fun for Cole to play with the idea of nothing in riddle-like prose, but it really takes away from the science of the book. I say skip to the bibliography and read the books cited. They may be more concise 
 Is this Deaver's worst book? I honestly don't know because I haven't read everything he's written. However, I can emphatically say this is the worst of his books I have read -- and I have read most.  (... 
 E40 is the worst MC i have ever heard i would rather listen to someone drag their nails down a blackboard. How on earth can  someone like him get a record contract and sell records. Anytime he comes on another rappers album no matter how good the beats are I always skip the track 
 Willow was a good movie, but hopefully they don't turn the Shadow series books into a movie.  Too much description, not much action.  I kept reading, though, hoping the next book in the series would be better, only to be disappointed.  I skipped pages at a time just to get to some sort of dialog or action.  The brownies supposedly had a great wit, but there was no evidence of it in the books.  Too bad, they could've been a great plus, like Tas the kender in the Chronicles series.  As far as the Elora, the wittiest she ever got was by sticking her tongue out in response to any lame jokes the brownies made. In conclusion, don't waste your time with these books 
 The first album was very good. 2nd album ripped my heart out. One of the best bands of the last couple of decades. Drops of Jupiter got me thru some rough times. 3rd album was pretty good also but I could tell some changes were coming. In the meantime some very key and important members left the band and with them some of the things that defined the Train I had grown to love...left with them. This fourth album is a sore dissappointment. Pat's ego clearly isn't enough to carry this formation of Train. He is  very talented but IMHO he was only one piece of the puzzle. Now , thanks to him..the  other pieces are gone. They should form a new band and leave the name Train to live on  in our memories of what it used to be 
 I thought the product arrived in a timely manner.  The instructions were clear, but it's hard to hold the stencils and put on your eyebrow at the same time.  Not a bad product for the price 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 I must admit that I finished only 2/3 of this book, I just could not bear anymore, even as entertainment.  It was that bad.  But, from what I read, I advise that the plot is pointless and unrealistically laid down.  The characters, especially the main character and her love interest, are very poorly developed.  What is developed of the main character is unlikeable.  The book has the tone of someone who is talking (i.e. writing), not because she has something to say (she doesn't), but because she likes the sound of her own voice.  Wolitzer does know how to string words together well, but there is nothing upon which to hang those words, which is insulting to the reader. I knew before I read the book jacket that Wolitzer much teach creative writing.  It is obvious from the content of the book that she considers herself a literary giant and thinks that impressive. She should stick with that, her "novel" is beyond disappointing.  I'm sorry but the comparison to Wolitzer to Anne Tyler is laughable. 
 I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!! 
 Decent camera, but not great.  Shark mode is nice.  Housing looks good, but mine leaked at ~20 ft...camera was dead by the time I got it out of the water.  Good news is that Amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week.  Net result was one decent picture and a disappointing Christmas present.  Next time I will buy a housing for a better camera.  Canon has some nice ones 
 I really wanted to read this book.  I've read a lot about the Nazi persecution of Jews, as well as their persecution of Russians, Slavs, homosexuals, anarchists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and so on.  But I hadn't read much about their persecution of the Roma, or Gypsies, and I wanted to learn about it. But the book is extraordinarily dry.  The author did not bring the events to life at all. It's pretty hard to make a subject as inherently dramatic as the systematic persecution of an entire people not very interesting, but the author succeeded.  What's worse, really, was that as other reviewers suggested, there was a powerful theme of underplaying the importance of what happened to the Roma. I was very disturbed by this. I give the book two stars instead of one because I did learn a few things. But I will be looking for another book on the subject, because I didn't learn enough 
 This is the fourth Hoffman on DVD, all lacking something. This one has beautiful singing but that's where it stops. It is modernized and the villain wears a suit and sun glasses. In no way is he sinister or frigtening. The sets are beyond belief. The Barcarolle has to be seen to be believed. No water, just rows of undulating theater seats surrounding the singers. The worst sin if the casting as most members just don't look the part. Though Suzanne Mentzen sings beautifully she looks awful in the pants role of Nicklausse. And, at the conclusion,in a very brief stint as the Muse, she destroys it as she looks nothing like a Muse should. Many other cast members look like they walked in from Lulu or another opera. This is a Hoffman that would be better heard than seen. 
 Just plain, lots of photographs and little substance. Won't add anything new or usefull if you are a skilled cook.  
 I would have loved it if they sent it, but after over 2 weeks of telling me that it was in stock & on it's way, the company fessed up that they were out of the color that I chose. The other color that they wanted to sub. looked pretty bad so I cancelled 
 This insipid remake takes far too many liberties with the story, butchers its source material, and unsurprisingly ends up being quite a mess. Furthermore, the movie doesn't even really make sense when you think about it. The protagonist this time wants to travel to the past to save his love, and finds he can't alter what happened. He then goes to the future where he CAN alter events. The remake entirely forgets the point that the Eloi are supposed to be human cattle. That they're not kind of entirely destroys the whole point of the book, and the film greatly suffers as a result. The character played by Jeremy Irons was a dumb addition to the story. Ironically, the special effects used to depict the Morlocks were better in the 60s film 
 A very strange film about a seemingly (physcially) normal adult male who has the mentality of a baby - he's looked after by his mother and two sisters who treat him as a baby.  Then a social worker takes an interest in the case. She has certain 'designs' on him, but not like one of his sisters who casually gets in his cot one evening for a bit of a quickie - obviously he's all adult physically - but this scene is not very explicit and rather quick. 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 While Paulos undertakes a very ambitious and intriguing topic in this book, his efforts do not go far at all ... a lot of the material covered in this book was covered in his previous books that dealt solely with  mathematics and his efforts at bridging the analysis of mathematics with  stories is weak at best. He should have put much more emphasis on the craft  of building and reading stories and how that relates to peoples  understandings of probability and statistics. Disappointing 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 Tool Sucks    Enough Said. I Feel Robbed For Having To Give This Garbage One Star 
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 WARNING!  My Oxford World's Classics paperback copy had pages of Thoreau's "Walden"  inserted after p.158 of the story "The Room in the Dragon Volant."  Missing are approx. 50 pages of the LeFanu story, so it's not like it's a bonus.  I'm letting Amazon know about it, but check your copy on receipt!! Very disappointing to not know what happens, kind of like watching a thriller on TV and then the power goes out, but the broadcast stays on so you miss the middle.  I do rate LeFanu's stories 4-5 stars though.  Really well-written page turners 
 Silver Ravenwolf has crossed the line between fiction and fact yet again. This book is littered with historical inaccuracies, and as always, what Silver wants to be true will be true in her books. She tries to interprete all of history and spirituality in one sweep of words, and I must say, it is extreemly shallow. She shows no respect for any tradition, except her own misguided versian of Wicca. Although she borrows a lot of her information from Christianity, she continues to subtly blast the Christian religion, in her attempt to make money, by writing about subjects that are vastly beyond her comprehension. 
 There is a problem with the DVD, it freezes up right in the middle of the documentary 
 I was a bit disappointed in this book. The designer's style seems very one note-I have to agree it's kind of a rero rehash-that looks dated to me. I think it's a fun book for the generation x folks who might think this sort of thing looks fresh and new. To someone a bit older, who has seen this stuff in it's original form, it just looks like a 60's stage set 
 I purchased this car for my 2 year old son for Christmas.  Shame on me for not taking it out of the box and testing it out prior to Christmas morning.  The car lights up and makes sounds (very annoying) but didn't move an inch.  I replaced all batteries - still no movement.  The manufacturer was of no help.  Thank god someone else also got him the Chicco remote control car - because it works!  Steer clear of this stinker 
 This stroller is way to heavy, too long, steering is very difficult and too bulky, it is huge when folded.  Try something else.  
 This is an unbelievably bad book. The story, including the identity of the villain, is obvious within the first chapters. The characters, dialogue and situations are so unbelivable as to be ridiculous. If the protagonists in this story graduated from medical school, I might consider sending my hamster, because they seem to have about an equal intelligence level. David and Angela should have figured this whole mess out even before I did, but they were too busy listening to their daughter's improbable dialogue, answering her with trite, cutesy nonsense, and putting her into situations that should have made them lose their parenting privileges. Cook should leave polemics about HMOs to the analysts and concentrate on basic writing techniques - plot, character development and dialogue 
 I'm a big fan of Colin Firth and I was disappointed of this movie, I felt sleep, wish I never do on an average good movie, I do not recommended if you've seen Bridget Jones diaries, not even close.. 
 An interesting discussion of differing approaches by the medical and non-medical communities. The techniques espoused by Mr. Sarno didn't help my back pain, though 
 When the character who is narrating a lengthy novel is as unbelievable and artificial as Hannah Musgrave is in "The Darling", the book is not worthy of completing.    
 Santa brought this present for my three year old daughter this past year. Boy, wasn't Santa surprised to find such junk in the box. The bar was junk, the mat was junk, and the DVD was worse than junk!  I don't think I could find anything else on TV as bad as this DVD. The music was horrible. It's supposed to be a ballet DVD. Let's try some classical music?? Of all the beautiful young women on the planet, they had to pick this girl?? I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this was definitely the producer's daughter, as she had absolutly no other redeeming qualities. She has a horribly annoying voice, a face that hasn't launched any ships, and no talent for ballet.   I have not let my daughter watch the DVD since Christmas week as I just can't stand it. She does run around the house singing bella bella dancerella. But I just put on our Dance with Barbie tape.   Don't waste your money! If you decide that you have to have it watch for sales as we got it for $[...]at Target. 
 This book is poorly written, _utterly_ disjointed, and has a cloying sentimentality that is really annoying.  By that I mean it's not at all analytical: it includes random snippets of poems, etc. that serve only to confound the reader looking for some meat.  Plus, there are certain phrases like "cutting sign" that I hadn't the foggiest idea about until I looked it up.  Help the reader out here.  Yeah, it's hot as hell in the desert, and it's doggone handy to have water.  It sucks that people are dying in the desert and the forces that draw them to _El Norte_ are highly complex and not necessarily their fault.  Still, they are breaking the law from the word go, and well they know it, and it seems to me there are worse tragedies involving truly innocent people.  Plus, it peeves me to no end that these illegals have largely trashed some of the most beautiful and exotic wildernesses in the U.S.  So my sympathy is just not all that deep.  The photos are for the most part of lousy quality as well.  Why it took carrying several cameras, as the author claims, to produce these pictures is beyond me.  Lastly the book is VERY short, with a ridiculously long appendix addressing every single death that has occurred in this area ... newsflash: no one is going to read that.  How could the editors have allowed a book like this to go to press?  It's absolutely amateurish, despite being driven by sincere emotions 
 Purchased a total of 20 of these.  I previously sold the American International brand Sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market. Four of the twenty Terk brand units were dead on installation. Sadly, I thought Terk was a quality brand. My mistake! 
 I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite. The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 Yet another kids take a roadtrip movie and find themselves lost flick. Although some of these type movies can and are very good, this one is not all that good. As you would expect, the kids happen upon a gas station where they are warned of impending danger. Although I must say that the opening scene where the chick gets killed by a man with a hook for a hand was cool. The kids happen upon inbred killers who kill some of them with the rest worrying for their lives. There is gore and some good killing scenes, I have to say. But I'll never understand the comparison to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies! for no movie can come close!! I would maybe compare this film to Wrong Turn if I had to compare it to another film but I must say Wrong Turn was a Great film compared to this one. Just OK in my book 
 I reluctantly give this book one star only because it provides some interesting information. Please be aware, though, that the author veers between sense and nonsense. Some of his explanations are intriguing, such as the source of the phrase "bobe mayse." However, at times he writes as though his comments are universally accepted facts rather than his own interpretation. I was extremely upset that he presumed to speak for anyone but himself and did not clarify that he was doing so.   The most egregious example concerns his comments about "goyim." He starts by referring to a "goyishe kop" which according to him means an idiot or simpleton, rather than someone who does not necessarily think the same way a Jew might (and why should a non-Jew think like a Jew, when their experiences may be vastly different?). He then writes, "On the great chain of Yiddish being, gentiles fall somewhere between Francis the Talking Mule and Bigfoot, and goy is almost always as much as to say uneducated, uncouth,uncircumcised--". In my opinion, this  inflammatory statement marks Wex himself as decidedly uncouth, although apparently educated and perhaps circumcised. I don't know why he chose to make statements like these, but he does NOT speak for anyone but himself. In the glossary he translates "goy" as "non-Jewish man" ("goye" being the female equivalent). I was astonished that he did not provide the literal translation, which is "nation." Look up, for example, Exodus 19:5, in which God tells Moses to tell the people of Israel: "Now therefore, if you will obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my own possession among all peoples... [6] and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation." The Hebrew for "nation" is "goy."   Further, in Exodus 34:10: "And he said, 'Behold, I seal a covenant. Before your entire people I will do marvels, such as have never been created in the entire world and among all the nations'..." -- the Hebrew for nations is "goyim."  So non-Jews are no more nor less than parts of goyim/nations, and Jews are part of a goy/nation called the Children of Israel. Therefore, a Jew is just as likely as a non-Jew to behave like an idiot; and since Jews have been charged by God to keep His covenant in order to be considered His people, it is perhaps less forgivable when a Jew behaves badly.   The author's comments in the next few pages about "shikses" are equally abhorrent, but I will aggravate myself no further with attempts at clarification. I hope readers understand that they should read this book with caution, if at all 
 The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.  AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck 
 This film is pure c..p.  For many years, there has been explicit sex used in many mainstream European films.  It is no longer the novelty it once was.  There is a point where you don't care about the sex, and you just wonder whether the film is any good.  So, yes, there are explicit sex scenes here, but that's it.  If you like porn, I would actually recommend watching something different, because the filmmakers here are trying to make us think that this is an important film.  It isn't.  You're better off looking at porn.  Baise Moi (roughly translated means "rape me") looks cheap (shot on DV), and it's a poor man's Thelma and Louise, with some John Woo style shootouts thrown in.  The film isn't intelligent or innovative in the least.  It is actually incredibly boring and feels like a 3 hour film, despite the fact it's only 73 minutes long.  If you want to see intelligent, thoughtful filmmaking on sexual matters, rent and/or buy Catherine Breillat's films.  Her films are far superior to this trash.   
 After I read stories about problems chlorine causes in the shower chlorine I got this filter.  It turns out most water systems are using chloramine now, a more stable additive, instead of chlorine and this filter, like most, is ineffective at removing chloramine.  See if your water system uses chloramine and save yourself an expensive filter that probably doesn't work 
 This is undoubtedly the *worst* book I have ever read about writing or crafting a novel.   It's hard to know where to begin when listing the things that turned me off. Perhaps it was the useless 'advice' that took up the first 1/4 of the book ["Readers want interesting characters." "Every novel needs a lead character..."].  Pretty self-evident to anyone who has EVER read a novel. Sadly, Marshall doesn't spend too much of his own time writing about giving characters depth and complexity.  No, he devotes a good portion of the book to charts that dictate how many lines each character should have, on what page each character should appear, etc.  The inside of this book looked like a diet book with weight and height tables, rather than a serious guide to writing a novel.    With so many much better books on this subject available, I can not see recommending this to ANY writer, regardless of skill level.  I suggest anyone thinking about buying this book take this simple test - find a copy of the book in your local library or bookstore, and check out the "Sample Synopsis" of a novel written using Marshall's method in the book's appendix. If the novel outlined in this synopsis - with its 2-dimensional, stereotyped characters and hack plot - is the kind of thing YOU would like to learn to write, then by all means buy one of the many used copies up for grabs on Amazon.  The work you produce will be less competition for the rest of us.  
 I love "The number one detective agency" series, and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales.  Unfortunately there was no narrative flow, making the stories stilted and un-interesting.  Maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped.  I suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable 
 Great looking keyboard. Unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed. That includes cleaning. And don't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it. The keyboard self destructs after you have the, count them, 10s and 10s of screws.  I called their customer support. They weren't like DELL, nobody is that bad, but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50% off their retail price. shipping was extra. So you save maybe $10 off street prices.  All-in-all they are no longer the good company they were in the past. They need competition. So I'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement. Too bad they don't make those old keyboards anylonger 
 I hate to be so critical, but I must agree with my colleague who described his/her harrowing experience with this textbook. I have two rules about learning statistics: no one is ever above a review of the most basic topics and an author/professor can never go wrong by providing a variety of examples within the same topic area 
 I got this as a gift for my 18 month old son. It only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle, very sad. My son got very frustrated and so did I. I would not recommend this product. 
 Other reviews of this book have done a good job of summarizing its thesis, which is that dogs were "previously" bred for physical labor and are now primarily in the business of serving their owners' emotional needs.  I've really enjoyed some of Katz's previous books.  I am not a "dog person," but I have found his analysis of dog/human interactions to be well-documented and surprising. This book, however, was a big disappointment. Katz provides little evidence for his historical generalizations, and, by focusing largely on suburban owners who have unbalanced relationships with their canines, he overstates the significance of the "new work" he identifies for dogs.   Katz focuses almost exclusively on middle-class American dog owners, with little attention to urban dwellers (save one chapter)or rural dog-owners who still use their dogs for farm labor or hunting, not "show" sheepherding.  What about dogs in other countries and locales, who still perform work in a variety of contexts?  We don't even have to leave the US for examples.  How are dogs in Alaska or Wyoming or the Jersey Pine Barrens different from dogs in the smug 'burb of Montclair?   Dogs have labored as part of the family for centuries, and they still do in many parts of the world.  But that doesn't mean they also haven't served as loved and loving companions as well. Literature from previous eras is full of examples of how domestic pets have meant more to their humans than just "go get the sheep, Spike."  (And not just in children's books; check out poet Christopher Smart's seventeenth-century poem "In Praise of my Cat Geoffrey.")  Katz doesn't talk about the history of dog/human relationships in depth; he simply argues by assertion that dogs were "previously" used for physical labor and are are "now" primarily engaged in emotional labor.  I think a wider perspective and a "both/and" focus would be more informative for Katz to pursue. Today, serving humans' emotional needs may be the primary task of suburban dogs - but it's not the ONLY THING. Sometimes humans' relationships with dogs are balanced rather than pathological or subtly abusive (like many of the owners he portrays in his book).  Some dogs aren't just "used" by humans, but develop powerful attachments to people - in spite of Katz's assertion, based on advice from a breeder friend, that dogs will forget a vanished human almost immediately.  Finally:  when humans observe emotional responses in animals, this doesn't necessarily mean we're anthropomorphizing.  Perhaps emotions aren't a uniquely human province.  Perhaps humans as a species aren't as exceptional as we like to think we are. Perhaps there is a much wider territory out there than Katz maps here.     
 It was about a girl who was picking out a present for herself.  Her mom was buying it for her.  She didn't know what to pick.  But finally she decided.  Read this book to find out what she picked 
 This release doesnt play on Toshiba HD-DVD players. So if you have a Tosh better wait until they release an firmware update (I have no hope that they will be releasing one in 2-3 months). There are many other HD-DVD titles that wont play on Toshiba players, better check out before ordering one 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 This book was simply not up to Baldacci's usual quality.  The story goes all over the place, but doesn't get anywhere until the last 50 pages.  Even after 200, 300, and even 400 pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going.  I don't mind suspense, but you can stay "suspended" only so long until it becomes boredom.  The main character is the worst one Baldacci has ever created.  One minute she is crying her eyes out, and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear, and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept FBI agents and police.  This is repeated throughout the story.........I would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book.  She makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people, but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers.  By the end of the book I found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid [...] off.    This is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping. 
 When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done.  Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  "A Beautiful Mind" 
 Plain Truth, set in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, would be better entitled, Fancy Lies. An eighteen-year-old Plain woman wakes up with labor pains, gives birth in a calving pen, cuts the umbilical cord and prays, "Lord, please make this go away." When she awakens and the baby is no longer with her, she whispers, "Denke," and goes on with her day. Later, after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate, she tells them "I didn't have a baby," as blood trickles down her leg. Without providing spoilers, two (of many) implausible situations follow. First, two women, one old, one young, both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse, defying the odds of fertility. Second, a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity-free farm out of the kindness of her heart. In summary, a two-page italicized section mid-book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages. Those interested in reading just one book by Jodi Picoult should choose My Sister's Keeper. Chris Bohjalian's Midwives is better. 
 I'm really not sure how anyone could give this 'book' 4 or 5 stars???  Have any of you people writing these reviews actually seen other books on the medium.  Must be not.    It's just a small collection of tattoo photos with little or no text accompymining them and no theme or direction to the photos and 'book' at all.  Before I bought the book I was fooled by the rave reviews and the $6.00 price.  I'm thinking, 'How could a tattoo book with such great quality be only $6.00?'  Now I know.  Just like your Momma warned you, "If it sounds too good to be true it probably is".  Moms was right.  Stay away from this book and do yourself a favor--go down to your local magazine shop and shell out the $5 or $6 for a quality tattoo mag.  You'll get about 10 times the bang for your buck.  If you really want a killer book on tattooing (albeit in the Japanese style) shell out the extra $$$ for Bushido.  Now that is what a book on tattooing should look like and read like.    This was garbage.  
 Did Danielle really write this?  It seems like it was written by an adolescent girl.  I thought it might get better but it never did.  I'm glad this was a library book 
 my disappointment in this book can only be expressed by the following blunt statement:  the purpose of this book is to enrich the author.  no benefit to the reader is evident.  I would recommend saving your pennies and looking elsewhere 
 I absolutely would recommend avoiding this item. It has a vile aftertaste - even if you can stomach artificial sweetener, this product's flavor is so blatantly unnatural. If you can get past the sweetener and the frightening list of ingredients, the texture isn't particularly appealing, what with the tiny granules floating throughout. I know this dessert sounds too good to be true, and it is 
 Could have been better written, better acted, better photographed. Way too many flashbacks.  This whole thing is kind of a mess, really. Lacks cohesiveness.  Premise is interesting enough and a truly gifted director might have made a great film out of it.  The guy who directed this is no Akira Kurosawa, that's for sure 
 I often cringed while reading Mancur Olson's Power and Prosperity. This book, published posthumously, lacks the clarity and force that are typical of the author's other works.  Olson sets out to explain why countries formerly under fascist governments have generally experienced economic growth while former socialist countries have not. He elaborates his "stationary bandit" theory of the state, which argues that a government that is wholly self interested still has an incentive to provide some collective goods in order to increase the pot from which it can take. Olson then takes the reader through different examples, derivations, and implications of the stationary bandit theory. This is perhaps the best portion of the book.  Olson concludes that "incomes are low in most of the countries of the world, in short, because the people in those countries do not have secure individual rights". He believes that if rights are secure and well defined and if individuals are free from predation, then economic growth will result from a market economy.  Alright. I agree with the conclusion, but Olson does not succeed in building a compelling argument or in making clear why some countries are like this and others are not. Furthermore, Olson quickly dismisses a world with no government without facing any of the best arguments in favor of anarchy. This keeps the reader wondering what "market-enhancing government" really means.  I highly recommend two of Olson's other books -- The Logic of Collective Action and The Rise and Decline of Nations. As for Power and Prosperity, skip it entirely. I was surprised to see such a mediocre book from such a great mind, and I can only guess this is the result of inadequate preparation due to his untimely death 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 An admiring though shallow and poorly written account of a unique American genius. Though salted with several good anecdotes, Gordon's book mostly relies on the research and interviews of others and ultimately does little to explain McKinley Morganfield's life and times. For a writer who presumes to account for the life of a musician, Gordon's descriptions of various Waters recordings are especially poor. Far far better is his video documentary of the same name. One suspects the book is the assembled notes of that project 
 Is this research? Is it a long statistical essay? Or is it an agenda-laden piece of you know what? Has Mr. Greene ever spent a second in front of a real classroom? He criticizes Jonathan Kozol referring to his writing as "anecdotal" and not research-based. OK. But at least Kozol has done some 'real" leg work and visited schools in poverty stricken areas all over the US and speaks with the kids, parents, teachers, and principals.  Plus, Kozol is a talented writer.  Reading this book, however, one gets the feeling that Mr. Greene has been hanging with the high set rather than the homeboys.  The chapter where he contends that there is no evidence demonstrating that smaller class size has educational benefits is pretty laughable. Ask anyone who has ever taught both small versus large classes. There is no comparison.  Come on, Jay, even you can't believe what you've written, deep down 
 This book is an emotional appeal that will leave you 'empty'  The author does not cite sources. It is sadly true, there is no bibliography. No one in the academic community could get away with this.  Do not waste your time reading someone's opinion that is not legitimately cited. 
 The last release from the Wham duo isn't really a full-fledged album, and is actually more of a semi-compilation of previously-released recordings that had yet to appear on a Wham album and three newly-recorded songs.  The new tracks include the energetic hit "The Edge of Heaven" (#10 US, #1 UK), the underrated flop "Where Did You Heart Go?" (#50 Pop), and the cool album track "Battle Stations."  Also included are the three single-only releases from the past two years - the holiday-themed "Last Christmas" (#2 UK), the terrific "I'm Your Man" (#3 US, #1 UK), and George Michael's solo ballad "A Different Corner" (#7 US, #1 UK).  Unfortunately, the classic "I'm Your Man" is presented in a frankly horrible remix that drains most of the energy out of this high-octane track.  The only other two tracks are an okay live recording of the song "Blue" and a decent remix of the "Wham Rap."  Even though it really isn't a proper album per se, Music from the Edge of Heaven collected enough hits and worthy tracks to peak at #10 on the Hot 200, and is worth picking up if you're a fan of the duo 
 One at the front: The really own words of the master are excellent. One must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with Bruce Lee. The rest consists of interviews with the former  interviewers. However, as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune.  But the words of the master are absolutely worth-while, as already  mentioned at the beginning 
 [...]  Certainly I would like to believe the book's central thesis, that Osama bin Laden and other jihad terrorists violate the tenets of traditional Islam, but the book fails to make this case. For example, the opening essay by David Dakake mentions ahadith that forbid mujahedin from killing women and children, but breezes by the caveat emphasized by many Islamic jurists -- unless they are aiding the war effort -- which the jihadists use to justify killing innocent civilians. He gives no explanation of how moderate Muslims might refute this. Nor does he, in a lengthy explanation of the laws of jihad concerning warfare against Jews and Christians, even once mention the central text on this subject, Qur'an 9:29 -- a glaring omission that casts doubt upon the entire enterprise.  If traditional Islam refutes jihadism, that is good news, and a source of hope for an end to the crisis within Islam. But pretending that this is so, as this book essentially does, doesn't make it so. This book may reassure non-Muslims who know little of Islam that Islam is peaceful, but it will do nothing to convince jihadist Muslims to lay down their arms 
 I ONLY READ THIS BOOK B/C I HAD TO FOR ONE OF MY MANY ENGLISH COURSES, AND IT WAS EXTREMLEY BORING! MAYBE B/C I JUST IM NOT ATTRACTED TO BOOKS ABOUT POLITICS, AND IN THIS CASE FASCHISM.I'LL GIVE LEWIS THE CREDIT FOR PREDICTING WHATS ALREADY SEEMING TO HAPPEN IN 2006 U.S.A, BUT THIS BOOK IS PRETTY DANG BORIN'...SORR 
 I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense. Then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship.  But it gets kind of repetetive and boring, because they just go from one room to another.  It's like they get into one room, someone says "Here, this is the only way out."  Someone else says that maybe there's another way, but the other person says there isn't, then the water's coming, so they have to get out of that room quickly.  When they make their way into the next room, it's the same thing over and over again. When they finally get off of the ship, they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off.  Then a guy shoots a flare, helicopters come, and the movie's over. So basically, this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over.  This is one movie I know I won't be buying 
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 This is another example of what happens when good articles are extended into poor booklength works.  The author's mother said the author's father forced her through a glass window once and yet the author blames her mother and all women with a backbone on fatherlessness in Black America.  Daniel Moynihan's 1965 report on the Black family has been attacked by African-American thinkers of both genders, yet Barras hardly sees a problem with it.  This book does nothing but blame women for being victims.  Like all conservative rants, it blames feminists, rather than sexism for the problems that women have.  This could have been an exciting, thoughtful book; instead, the author speaks in hyperbole and sees no problem with being ridiculously one-sided.  Further, she's a journalist, not an academic or an author.  Thus, not only should the book be seen as amateur, but it's written in an allegorical style that I found silly.  This book should not be embraced by the African-American community.  As a pro-feminist brotha, I can't understand why a sista would created this misogynistic tool to harm Black single mothers and womanists throughout the nation 
 Many years ago I enjoyed reading Ivins' columns but unforunately her brand of independent liberalism has turned into just another mainstream media voice parroting the Democrats. Her personal hatred of George Bush has become distracting and embarrasing. Strangely enough she reminds me of Rush Limbaugh. When he began doing political commentary on the radio Limbaugh was an independent with a conservative streak and was comfortable attacking Republicans. Similarly Ivins was originally an independent with a liberal streak who was comfortable attacking Democrats. Now Limbaugh is as firmly ensconced in the Republican camp as Ivins is in the Democratic camp.  What a shame 
 I bought this as I am a Seattle resident (also 20s/30s female like the main character).  I thought it would be cool to find a book that combined the story of a woman's growth and a setting in Seattle.    Unfortunately, it's not a strong story.  The main character is shallow and self-absorbed, and the other characters aren't compelling- and this doesn't change over the course of the story.  The story revolves around the character's relationships to men and a couple of female characters (mainly her mother and her best friend)- not compelling alternative Seattle characters.  I really don't feel that this is a compelling story of human growth or broadening horizons 
 I had to read most of the essays in this book for an English MA course.  The best essays were the ancient ones.  The moderns ones were often dry and dull, with the exception of George Orwell.  His memories of his school days were like something out of a Charles Dickens novel, which was depressing and shameful, but rather interesting 
 The introduction starts out with a defense of anthropomorphization as an important tool in scientific study, arguing that it gives us terms in which to define what is being seen.  Then she seems to descend into lunatic delusions that she can speak to the animals and read specific motives and feelings out of each dogs ear cock and eye roll without any apparent research aside from her personal examinations.   Her pregnant female dog is stressed so Thomas tries to soothe her telling her it is alright, but the dog "doesn't believe" her-- alternative interpretation, she reinforces the dog's anxiety by rewarding her, and the dog stays anxious.  Duh.  You listen to her describe what she sees, and then she launches into kookoo interpretations and ponder how she reached that conclusion.    One of the other reviewers gave higher marks because he viewed the book as a fascinating look into the pathology of Ms. Thomas as a nutcase.  I wish I had looked at it that way.  I spent way too much time venting at her stupidity.  I'm not quite as intensely offended about the responsibility implications of Ms. Thomas' book as other reviewers-- maybe I am not thinking globally enough.  Of course, I certainly wouldn't leave my dog with her. 
 And I still can't find those little aliens :)  Really, there is no conspiracy.  And there certainly ain't no extraterrestrial life.  The only mysteries of Ancient Egypt is why current Egypt is still so backwards 
 Be forwarned, this book merely reprint articles from past (and some may say ancient) issues of Model Railroader magazine.  An expert model-railroader could probably create some of them, however, for a novice this provides little more than ideas for layouts.  Also, many of the plans are for HO and N scale, with very few O scale layouts.    Overall, I'd say there are better layout books out there for you to spend your money on 
 I had heard good things about this magazine and so ordered a sample.  It is a lovely magazine, beautiful photos and it is interesting reading about "other coasts" (besides east and west).  But, at least with the most recent issue, in every article about families or couples and their coastal homes the people were all caucasian.  Even the advertisements had only white people (save for one about vacationing in Mexico that had some cute Mexican children in it).  While I doubt this is intentional, I would encourage the publishers of this magazine to put their attention on this issue.  There are plenty of people of color living on the coast who have interesting homes and lives that readers would enjoy learning about 
 I bought this skirt because of the great reviews, but when I got it the smell was horrible when I opened up the package. It smells like formalin(very strong!). I already washed it 3x but the formalin-like smell is still there. The smell reminds me of preserved frogs in my Zoology class. I wonder if it was dyed right. I'm not gonna it.---S.M. NY 
 Sorry this was my lease favorite of Bobby Bear maybe because they where not his songs! 
 I bought it new. After using this shaver a couple of times in a shower, it stopped working. I took it to a Braun affiliated repair shop. Braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior, including the electronics. They said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me.   I checked the manual before I used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower. I have not opened the shaver, I have not cleaned it in water.   Thus, based on my experience, this shaver and Braun are a scam as far as I am concerned 
 I agree with the sentiments of the previous two reviewers.  I had the Raindrop Technique performed on me by a 'certified' aromatherapist (most likely certified by Gary D. Young?)and my skin's reaction was to turn beet red along with an intense burning sensation. Obviously, an allergic reaction to the applied neat essential oils. The aromatherapist in question, seemed perplexed and replied, "Hmm, this shouldn't be happening!"   Well, any aromatherapist worth her/his salt, should know that one does not apply undiluted essential oils directly onto the skin!   Since then, I've done my homework and I have found these facts: 1) Gary D. Young bought his N.D. degree from a Bernadean University, which is a diploma mill. (Type the school's 'name' in any search engine). 2) In the state of Utah, it is illegal for a licensed homeopathic professional to sell (retail, wholesaler, distributor,etc) homeopathic remedies., yet on many distributor websites, you will read that Young is listed as an N.D.(Young was not listed as a licensed professional in the state of Utah's DOPL database). This man has a long list of unsubstantiated claims in his background, yet try to tell that to his devotees. They will only laugh 'knowingly' and believe you to be an antagonistic naysayer.  What concerns me most is I am afraid many people will be turned off by essential oils, based on the claims of this one man. Another thing to me that I find disturbing is the unadulterated devotion that distributors hold for this man. (Think of a cult.) Scary 
 the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company 
 This book is absolutely wonderful, it should be required reading for every lawn fanatic out there. An ecological viewpoint presented in an easy to understand and engrossing style. I would recommend this book to everyone. I am giving copies of this book as presents and loaning my copy to friends. This would be the perfect book to donate to your local or school library 
 This book contains an interesting selection of photos of German and American prisoners, then and now; also a map of the United States showing hundreds of places prisoners were held.  Some interesting facts emerge such  as German prisoners held in Mississippi camps working in swamps and cotton  fields, suffering malnutrition,and in the words of one ex prisoner, being  "treated no better than the blacks we were working with.&quot 
 Have you ever gotten that embarrassed feeling for someone?  Y'know, you just want to cringe and make it stop.  Well, that's the way I felt about this book.  Jon Stewart, who is funny on T.V., is painfully unfunny in print.  This book was a chore to read.  I felt so bad for Mr. Stewart because he so clearly embarrasses himself with this book.  I wish his editor would've stepped in and protected him from doing this.  Stick to T.V., Mr. Stewart, you're no Mark Twain.  Yikes 
 Come on now you other reviewers, try being honest.  I know it's Dylan but three stars?? No way. If some other schmoe puts this dreck out there, you be saying,"well, it's interesting"?  Of course not! This is awful, bad, unlistenable, a waste of time, serving no purpose.  He using Nursery Rhymes as a format!  And you're stupid enough to listen to it?  I think Dylan's having the last laugh here. 
 I am a seamstress who knows how to sew, and how to thread both top and bobbin threads.  My daughter received this machine for Christmas.  We threaded it according to directions.  It sews about 10 stitches then jams.  I observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing, and leads to a jam every time.  Don't disappoint a child by purchasing this 
 Highly acclaimed. That, I knew. I watched the first 30 minutes, which is 1/4 of the movie, before I decided to hang it up. New lady moves into a conservative French town and opens a chocolate shop. This upsets the local church, even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate. Okay. Can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot? Nope. This one's boring.  
 I ordered the book through Amazon, because my local book store told me it wasn't available anymore in the Netherlands. It got sent my way very fast, I received in only a couple of days. But the inside of the package dissapointed me somewhat. The front of the book had this standard MS Powerpoint-like texture, which wasn't mentioned on the website. The pages are very, very thin and the images look kind of blurry, because "this book was printed digitally and produced in a standard design so that Hodder Arnold can ensure its continuing availability". I appreciate the possibility of byuing the book at Amazon, but one should have mentioned on the website that it was a poor substitute for the original book. A little bit disapponted I must say. I hope my next purchase will be more to my liking.  Best regards, mr Anne-Krijn Piersma, the Netherland 
 This DVD has lots of beautiful video and photography, but that beauty is grossly diminished by an overbearing, condescending, and monotone narration that is also too loud.  It would be a beautiful DVD if the narrator would shut up and not insult the intelligence of the viewer.  It should follow the pattern of Winged Migrations using just music and natural sounds and a few subtitles.  Instead it reads like a boring catalogue instead of a beautiful symphony.  They should have had at least one version with just music and natural sounds, and then the current version could just be used in elementary school classes.  There is room on DVDs for both, but the creator of this DVD is not very sophisticated in the art of film making 
 Neither my husband or i could get into the movie. I dont think i would ever watch this film again. It was not What it was made out to be 
 I have been a homemaker for almost 20 years and I have a lot of experience peeling vegetables...I am fast and have rarely cut myself.  However, I bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago I cut myself so severly with it, I thought about going to the hospital.  This peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others I have used and so it some how gives me an "out of control" feeling with each thrust.  It is also extra sharp.   I can't recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well 
 YIKES.. Saw this on TV a while back and there was no cussing.  Bought the DVD and wow, it was filled with it....way too much. But the story was very creative and would be a great family film if the language was cleaner.  Clean language would've earned a 5 star rating. 
 I found this book to be disappointing. The reason may simply be because The Killer Angels is such a hard act to follow. 
           J. M. Buchanan's(JMB)book is completely mistitled and out of date.Nowhere in any of Keynes's writings does Keynes ever advocate a policy of deficit finance,which is actually the brain child of Abba Lerner,a member of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis school of economics.Lerner used the term functional finance to describe deficit finance.During a visit to America in 1944 as the representative of England's Treasury Department,Keynes totally disagreed with Lerner's approach.Keynes's approach is an advanced version of the cyclically balanced budget first laid out in clear terms to the Pharaoh by Joseph some 3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.This is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.Keynes's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.The government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure(building dams,reservoirs,water projects-irrigation networks,seaports,airports,public transportation projects,public schools,colleges and universities,public research laboratories,etc.,)that would pay for themselves in the long run.Nor was Keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the  social security tax for workers only.Keynes's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings(greenmail,leveraged buyouts,hostile takeovers,margin account loans,corporate raiders,junk bonds,etc.).The correct title for JMB's book up until 1981 is"Democracy with minor to moderate deficits:The Political Legacy of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis School".After 1981,JMB should have retitled his book as"Democracy and Catastrophic Deficits:The Political Legacy of Laffer,Reagan,and the 12 years of the Two  Bush Presidencies" .The national debt when President Reagan took office stood at 925 billion dollars.As of July,2005,the national debt will have surpassed 8 trillion dollars.The Libertarian-pseudo conservative policies of tax cuts,borrowing and excessive spending of  8 years of Reagan and 12 years of the two Bush presidencies has increased our national debt by a factor of 9.JMB needs to completely rewrite his book.First,he needs to incorporate the theoretical foundations of the story of Joseph and the Pharaoh from the Old Testament.He will probably need to purchase a bible in order to correctly cite verse and page.Second,he needs to obtain a copy of Keynes's General Theory and read what Keynes actually wrote and not what Henry Hazlitt claims what Keynes meant in his 1959 "Failure of the 'New Economics'".   
 I had somewhat forgotten how Greg Bear wrote.  His descriptions of the  Jart are so obscure and long-winded, the reader may as well just turn the  page.  I found it annoying that Greg Bear attempted to invent even more  words in this book than Eon.  My largest complaint however resided in the  high number of typos, duplicated words, letters dropped etc that made the  reading even more disruptive.  It really looked like there had been global  replacements as the same errors were repeated.  While I'd admit that an  author is more concerned with flow, plot, and technical accuracy - the  editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals 
 An embarassingly bad book, unleavened by its unintentional humour. Rushkoffs silly solipsism conflates online and rave cultures into one big happy, zappy, zeitgeist -- which is simplistic to say the least. What¹s  worse, he wraps his first person report on technolibertarians and  neo-shamans in a retro-psychedelic bow, adding what sounds to me like an  uncritical endorsement of drug use. Avoid this book like the plague 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 The ideas and teachings in this book are just a regurgitation of easily obtainable information available in any Instructional Design publication at an extremely inflated price.  I don't know what Patricia Smith and Tillman  Ragan think they have here but I should write my own and sell it for a  third of the price 
 I couldn't get past chapter 5, and that was after skipping through some of the earlier chapters. Dull descriptions, and too many of them, dominate the writing. Characters were about as exciting as bricks. Plot development--ha! This is a mystery novel: why isn't the plot going anywhere?  And lest I forget, grammatical errors abound in this novel. Tip for you, Nevada: something is not "comprised of" things, things comprise a larger object. And Yosemite being at the same *longitude* as Mississippi? Pleaaase! Give me a break, it's barely at the same lattitude; Yosemite is 225 miles north of the very northern tip of Mississippi, and Mississippi is 300 miles long N to S. Hey Barr, are you sure you weren't smoking that dope when you wrote this?  Apparently (thank you other reviews), the punchline is that a plane full of dope has crashed in the mountains and people are swarming over each other to get at it. Big whoop. Come out to LA and you can see drug dramas for real--murder, intrigue, corruption and all.  Do something useful with your time: find a good Sherlock Holmes novel 
 Read the review by Matthew S.; I agree completely.  I am amazed by all the 5 star reviews, so I must be missing something (like drugs).  I got all the way through the book and took myself out for dinner as a treat for accomplishing the task.  I give this book 1 star as there is no selection for 0 or, better yet, -1.   I found the characters to be out from left field and behaving and thinking in ways far beyond their years.  The book was not believable and was boring 
 Don't buy this.  Seriously.  Someone is bound to release a better version.  This is PAN AND SCAN, cropped at 1:33, and seems to be transferred from some sort of used tape...Like a 3/4 inch VHS.  There are visible tape flutters and wrinkles throughout the film. And no it's NOT the print.  The film is fine.  It's the transfer.  cheap, cheap, cheap.  The compression is abysmal (notice the obvious scan lines on the titles) and the sound is piss poor.  How is it possible this is the only way this film is available in the US?  Disgraceful 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 I ordered this book with the idea, based on how it was advertised,that it was a summary of Esther Wilkins book. Instead,it was a workbook, without answer keys. It requires that you also have the book " Clinical practice of the Dental Hygienist" by Wilkins, for it to be of any value. I was very disappointed as to how it was represented by amazon.ca and the editorial review is not correct for the product 
 If you are looking for a good how to, this is not it.  If you are looking for erotic material, I'm sure there are other works out there.  I bought this book expecting tips and methods.  But there are only a few sections on  how-to.  Be sure to check this one out at a bookstore before buying.  It  may not be what you want 
 If you are reading this book, you probably fit into one of two categories. 1. You are a local from the region surrounding Coney Island or 2. You were assigned the book as required reading from a college History class.   While Kasson has certainly done his research on his subject, he struggles at times to find a story with some drama where very little drama exists. To make things more difficult, the reader is subjected to a sort of bastardized version of early twentieth century verbage throughout the text. For example, Kasson is particularly fond of the word "gentry" and uses it and other arcane terms frequently in presenting the story. Most likely, the intent was to give the reader a sense of the period in which the story occurs. Unfortunately, the effect is confusing, dry, and alienating rather than engrossing. Kasson does sucessfully connect individuals who have their own places in history to Coney Island, which is most likely why the book is cited so frequently in other books (132 at latest count) regarding this segment of history. The book is very difficult to read cover-to- cover. It appears that the auther intended for the reader to skip back and forth throughout the text. The final pages end with a one sentence wrap up and a picture. It is almost as if the author himself lost interest in his subject and called it a day. File it somewhere between an antique store and your Grandparent's family photos. Nice for a curious Coney Island history buff. Otherwise, a pretty dull and tedious read 
 This book fails my simple test for utility: The writer never gets around to describing, detailing, or otherwise explaining how you can get the results she gets. The book comes without user instructions.   No clear schematic and instructions is a common problem with self-help books. Most people are oblivious to exactly what it is they do well because the behavior is habituated. Consequently they cannot transfer the process to others because the process is outside of conscious awareness.  The book reminds me of an infomercial. It's almost entirely testimonials about how wonderful life can be if youre "In the Flow." But it never maps how you get from HERE to the FLOW 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 One of the first genres moviemakers turn to, when wanting to stir up a little historical or emotional reflection, is war.  Films about war make up some of the oldest in the history of the media, many of them about battles that never took place.  But throw in a dash of historical accuracy here and there (and at the producers' discretion) and you have a recipe for "classic" status.  Exhibit A: "Zulu."  Nevermind that this is the retelling of a senseless battle fought in the name of British colonial expansion, in which countless men died, Brits and Africans alike.  Who cares that the Zulu empire was as oppressive and unforgiving as any tribe on the continent.  Forget that the ultimate outcome - "victory" at Ulundi - resulted in British control of Zululand and naturally, a barbarous system of apartheid for the next 100+ years.  (As one reviewer pointed out, the Africans who played extra roles in the 1964 film weren't even able to go see the movie under the current policies of apartheid.)  Nevermind all that.  Tally ho, mates!  This is war, and war is classic.  Gather round and hear a tale of glory, courage and heroism... again.  Sure, the heroes in question are fighting in the name of racism and greed, but fighting bravely nonetheless.  And to counter any suggestion that the filmmakers condescend to the adversary, the Zulus are presented as equally brave.  Yes, bravery abounds.  After all, what better match for the white man's unflinching imperative than another power-hungry, merciless (but brave) army: that of the Zulus.  Make no mistake, this war story is told from the perspective of the white minority in Southern Africa; there are no significant individual characters on the African side.  And looking at things from that angle, one would have to spin the British effort in a somewhat positive light, or never sleep another night.  But to pretend that it is accurate or just to arbitrarily assign themes like "glory" and "patriotism" to what adds up to brutal militarism, is to deceive one's self utterly.  If anyone can tell me how the effort to defend British fortifications in South Africa in 1879 has made Africa (or the world) a better place, I will gladly take it all back.    In the meantime, filmmakers will continue to rouse passionate armchair patriotism, recalling the brave men who sacrificed their lives for the greater good, whatever that might have been.  Unfortunately, it is the public willingness to accept these tales as accurate, these missions as noble, and these surges of testosterone as plenty justification, that many more men and women will be needlessly sacrificed for years to come.  "Zulu" is indeed a classic war movie.  But ask yourself: is that always a good thing 
 Albert Hourani's A History of the Arab Peoples is a widely regarded general history of the Arab world. This is too bad, since as history the book is of low quality, with significant problems of organization and, where relevant to Hourani's apparent biases, factual accuracy. It does have its redeeming elements, but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the Arab world, especially for the beginner.  Being the author of a general history of the Arab world myself, before I explain why I evaluate the book negatively I would like to suggest some alternatives, lest I be accused of attacking a rival publication out of self-interest. Philip K. Hitti's The History of the Arabs is a very detailed history which runs from pre-Islamic times to the 19th century. Arthur Goldschmidt's Concise History of the Middle East covers Turkey, Iran and Israel as well as the Arab world and is well-organized for beginners. It was the first general history of the Middle East I read as an undergraduate. Bernard Lewis' The Middle East focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region.  This book was first published in 1991. This review is based on the 1992 paperback version by Warner Books.  The initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter; although containing 458 pages of main text, Hourani's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-Islamic period. This is pretty amazing, for anyone familiar with that period, since Arab history prior to Islam is roughly as long as Arab history after it. Exactly how far back Arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute, but certainly there were people one could call "Arabians" as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium BC, or 1,600 years prior to Muhammad. The evidence is sporadic for sure, and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times, but seven pages is pretty paltry.  One might suspect an Islamic bias here, but the problem continues in the key early periods of Islam. The life of Muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the Muslim world, spanning about a half century from Muhammad's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor Ali, get only 11 pages. The first Arab empire, the Umayyads (661-950), gets seven pages, and the Abbasid Empire (750-circa. 945), which is usually thought of as the "Golden Age of Islam," gets only six. This means 37 pages for the first 2,000 years of Arab history, including its framing epoch, and over 400 pages for the next 1,000. This would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion.  What makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization. The middle time period between the collapse of Abbasid authority - roughly AD 950 - and the ascendance of the Ottoman Empire over the Arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history. This is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states, there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of Sunni and Shia, Arab, Persian and Turkic ruling groups, not to mention the Latin states. Hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one. There are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods (the Umayyads and the Abbasids). There is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time. If you want to understand the relative historical roles of the Buyids, the Fatimids, the Zengids, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks and their contemporaries, read something else.  It is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its "social history," or its description of the development of the Arab world. In fact I cited Hourani on the social history sections of my own book. In this regard, Hourani really is better than the alternatives. Over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the Arab world came to be prior to the Ottomans. So for those who have already read a general history of the Middle East or the Arab world and want a more specialized knowledge, these chapters are quite useful.  I have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest. This book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of Arabs and Muslims, to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the Arab world which might be interpreted negatively. The word "jihad" doesn't even have an entry in the index, although it is used, or perhaps, misused. On page 247, Hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation "to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom's defense..." This gives a misimpression, because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of Muslim lands and the Muslim community's collective obligation to spread Islam through conquest. Although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application, its use is overwhelmingly in the military context, and while Muhammad's battles probably could be described as defensive, the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations (the Christian counter-offensives known as the Crusades being a major exception).  More broadly, the single most influential Islamist movement of the modern age, the Wahhabis, get only a few scattered mentions, and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time. The primary non-Islamist ideological influence, Marxism, is discussed of course, but the influence of Nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out. Nazi Germany is mentioned once in passing, and in the same paragraph on page 331 Palestinian leader Amin Husseini is mentioned, but it isn't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of Nazis, that he moved to Germany during the Second World War and played an active role in the Holocaust, or that despite this he was made leader of the Palestinian cause by the nascent Arab League after the war.  Hourani's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate, giving the impression that Egypt engaged in some bluster and then Israel started the war. He mentions Nasser's demand that the UN clear out of the Suez Canal zone, and includes the defense pact with Jordan, but omits a key fact - the mobilization of Egyptian forces in the Sinai. Once Egypt did this, Israel had no choice but to attack, because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization, while Egypt could. Hourani also doesn't mention the statements by Arab leaders to the effect that all Jews would be wiped out in the coming war.  On the whole, this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of Arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern. Otherwise, I do not recommend buying it 
 This book was boring beyond belief.  The story was predictable and transparent, and the characters were completely unrealistic.  If you are looking for something to help you sleep at night, this could be a find.  Ohterwise, just pick up the dictionary, which in my opinion is more interesting 
 This list is pretty standard, I think a trip to the chinaberry catalog or website would provide much better suggestions. Many of the stories included are classic. The author included a good amount of text describing each of the stories suggested. But in the last few years some amazing children's stories have been written that I think are much better, especially for the younger crowd in the board book and picture book category. We have an amazing collection of children's literature, but as I am always looking for more, I took this book out of the library and I was very disappointed. In our collection of thousands of books for my children, we have 15 of the suggested titles. My suggestion, go to chinaberry on the web and go from there 
 A good book of letters should bring its subject to life for the reader.   This book is dry to the point of being brittle.  At no time time during the  reading of this book did I get any sense of what Oppenheimer was feeling or  experiencing.  Oppenheimer was involved with one of the pivotal events of  this century and the whole experience comes off like a trip to a  neighborhood store.  The recollections mentioned in the title are not those  of Oppenheimer but of friends and family.  Like the rest of the book their  thoughts and memories add little to the understanding of Oppenheimer's life  and work

 Don't bother with this book.  Every place Richard went he ran into more characters and the whole point of the story had to be explained in painful detail to the new characters.  I have read the whole series and this was one of the worst.  Even a big important battle scene is barely talked about so they could focus on repeating Richards feelings to someone new... blegh 
 This could have been a very exciting book if it had been written by someone such as James Dodson instead of by Mr. Palmer.  Although he shares with us information about many exciting moments of golf matches and  facinating individuals, the book becomes incredibly boring because of all  his first person I-Me-My references 
 This book was probably five stars when it was published - in 1997.  However, too much has changed since then, obviously through no fault of the authors.  I knew I was in trouble when the authors raved about Motley Fool  and asked "can online trading be far behind?"  Save your money 
 The first few minutes of this movie had me rolling on the floor.  That laughter was quickly replaced by gasps of horror.  Had the film stayed on course with Borat poking fun at himself this could have been a great film.  Instead his tactics of inciting others by poking fun at them resulted in me turning off the film after only 15 minutes.  This film goes way beyond being unpolitically correct. 
 This book does have alot of different dips, but not much info on how to have a fondue "party".  It doesn't explain in detail the equipment you need or how to set everything up.  The only good thing about the book is that there are lots of pictures for preparation and presentation of the dips 
 When I watched this stinker, I felt like sniffing it and covering it up. This is just another attempt to cash in on nostalgia.  Obviously the producers of the film were aiming at parents fond memories of the Dr. Seuss classic childrens book and tried to exploit it into an updated version. It fails miserably. It is another example of Hollywood dumping tons of money on the look of a movie instead of the script. Dont get me wrong, this movie looks great. It has awesome costumes and set design but the problem is, it seems like they whipped the screenplay out in 20 minutes. Even the kids think this movie stinks. Do your child a favor, avoid this film and instead sit down and read your child the original book. They will appreciate it way more.   
 This book really tells one nothing that cannot be easily gleaned from any number of truly fine books on woody plants (can anyone spell "Dirr", after whom the purchase of this book is nearly pointless).   I bought this book hoping it would be a fine, narrowly focused tome.  But it tells me nothing I did not already know, and suggested nothing that I had not already been made aware of by other truly splendid books.  Do not waste your money 
 I bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself.  Doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep.  Impossible to do both at the same time.  Even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results.  The feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked.  Mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women.  Basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female.   I was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back 
 Each story has a different author...however they all use the same verbage.  Their either all friends or the same person.  I do not like this book nor does my husband 
 This is the first review I've written for anything.  I am inspired to write about the Krupps Burr grinder because it is the most frustrating piece of equipment I have ever owned.  You have to whack it on the counter three or four times per grind to get it to complete the job.  We got it as a wedding gift and have since gone back to our blade grinder that saves time and aggravation 
 As an adoptee, I was shocked to read the second book of Nancy Verrier. She seemed to turn from the compassionate counselor and adoptive mother to someone who is bitter toward adoptees. I wonder if she has worked through the grief issues in her own life. I wouldn't recommend this book 
 I thought this book would give me guidance with regards to finding the right apartment, things to look for when visiting the apartment, reading leases, negotiating leases and calculating rent and expenses.  What this book did do was calculate a budget while factoring a tithe to the church, mention the importance of finding an apartment reasonably close to the church and/or church activities. So, if you want "bible," "God" or "Jesus" specifically named in your lease, or you plan on renting from your Pastor/Church Elder please feel free to read this book.  If you want real-world advice on renting an apartment, don't bother with this 50-page pamphlet. Try "The Savvy Renter's Kit" by Ed Sacks, instead 
 This book is so poorly organized that even the instructor who taught from it did not go through it sequential manner.  Difficult subject matter is not covered in big picture to small detail way, but instead is spread through out the book with little or no information on WHY things in organic chemistry work they way they do, and then it is not even cohesively brought to a summary.  There are not nearly enough mechanisms nor complicated synthesis.  It does touch on retro synthetic analysis but then offers very little opportunity for the student to practice complicated and varied synthesis.  The problems given at the end of the chapter are way to simplistic! It seems that this book tries to complicate Org much more than neccessary 
 This book should have been called "Beautiful Interior Designs that Happen to Include some Home Theater Gear", or "Home Theater Style".  It's little more than a pretty picture book of impressive-looking rooms that integrate HT gear, and often in a laughable way.  The text is fluffy, thowaway stuff that is irritating to read.  The photos are very well done, but often include speakers and other gear set up with no unsightly cables.  Of course, without the unsightly cables, there'd be no audio or video, either.  I guess that's the main thing that got to me -- if you're going to show a setup with nice speakers and other gear that are out in the room, at least be honest about how to treat cables and make them look as good as possible.  Don't just leave them out altogether.  It's insulting, and is foolish in a book that is supposedly about HT 
 Books of political position ought be fact ridden.  They should move you to the author's point of view, if not the author's conclusions, by marshalling facts first; then an author can supply analysis constrained by supplied facts.  Only then should we be given some further speculation, unless moving directly to reasoned conclusions.  Mr. Horowitz does none.  Instead he starves us for facts.  He substitutes instead only editorial cant.  I can conclude only that he aspires to persuade no one.  The audience is not the inquiring, the undecided or the doubting.    For example, he contrasts, on the first page the Iraq war as "so successful in its results.",  with the Vietnam conflict as an unsatisfactory result -- renaming in the process what we thought to be a war.  Mr. Horowitz insists on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  He states explicitly and blanketly that the execution of American power is a bulwark of national security.  He insists that American Presidents have been either the toys or the allies of terrorists.  I kept waiting for evidence of any kind.  He even says the twin towers were destroyed in only minutes, yet were more important than Pearl Harbor.  My guess is that WW II was not so cheap or unworthy.  Neither were the more than sixty boys from my high school killed in the World Trade Center; at least I can reference Time magazine as the source.  Mr Horowitz cheapens their deaths by saying it was the work of Democrats allied with moslems in their struggle with the Neo-conservatives whose birthright is the unfettered use of American soldiers and guards.    Mr. Horowitz has plenty of notes of a sort.  Many are only self-referential as opposed to supportive from other sources.  He quotes the New York Review of Books, but leaves out words he does not like.  Oddly he describes 9/11 as putting the Bush administration "on the run".  He probably meant something else, but is simply incapable of precision and accuracy in general.  I cannot even recommend the book to those who oppose his purposes because they are so incoherently hysterical 
 This has to be one of the worst casebooks I have ever read. The biggest complaint I have is that, for some reason, the author feels compelled to reveal the entire legislative history for every statute or immigration guideline. So if you are studying INA 237(x)(x)(x) you will not only get the very recent changes that led up to the statute, but the last 30 years of history. For true scholars of the law who have nothing better to do with their lives than read irrelevant legislative history I am sure this will please them. For actual law students who think succinctness is a virtue, stay away. Another minor problem is that the author has failed to label his notes. Labeling notes is a very common practice and is very helpful in summarizing what the note is about without having to first read it. Of course, I find the very subject of immigration law to be about as boring a class in law school as I have ever taken so maybe this casebook is just making the best out of a bad situation 
 This book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms. As a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure, I am always willing to learn  more about any kind of bodywork. I had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it. The book gives some accupoints for specific problems, some of these are "golden points" able to stand alone in use, but others are not. The book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence, or not. Also,it does't tell where the points are EXACTLY. There are really too many flaws to go into here. Acupressure is very complex, this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo 
 Although there are a few good recipes, I found this cookbook to be disappointing overall.  I'll start off with the good: The lemon tart recipe is not only delicious, but a breeze to make and worth the price of the book.  The chocolate sorbet is also delicious.  The quality of the paper and photographs are excellent, with many beautiful color photographs illustrating the finished product.  Now the bad:  There is at least one glaring typographical error in this book.  The recipe for Linzer Cookies calls for over 2 sticks of butter, 1 cup of hazelnut flour and 1/3 cup of flour.  These proportions simply do not work.  I had to add at least 1 1/2 cups of flour to prevent the cookies from melting into puddles of butter in the oven.  Given that the cover price is $35.00 and the author is a prominent N.Y.C. pastry chef, this alone justifies the two star rating.  There simply should not be any recipes whose failure is not attributable to any individual person's taste preferences but to incorrect ingredient proportions.  In addition, for what it's worth, three other recipes that I tried (Apricot Tea Cakes, Pineapple Tea Cakes, Golden Banana Cake) tasted very bad in my opinion.    For a good cookbook containing French-style pastries, try "Paris Sweets," by Dorie Greenspan instead 
 The DVD version of this game is terrible.  Syncing up the buzzer remotes to the DVD player is a lengthy process.  If successful, once synced the buzzers seem to be effective only half the time during game play.  However, the biggest problem with the game is that if you play the game more than once, several of the questions repeat which makes repeat playing of the game unfun 
 i've been reading the reviews for this book, and I wanted to offer up my own opinion.  I first read this book as part of my high school 11th grade english cirriculum.  And as a warning to others, I just wanted to say that reading this book was like watching paint dry.  There is no structure, and after a while it seems like your just reading page after page but are retaining nothing.  Though there are some very interesting funny parts in the books, the overall dullness of it all overpowers the good.  At some points, I wanted to claw my eyes out in despair.   I admit, I do love Mark Tawin, but this is in Noo sense, his best work.   Ones again, this is just my opinion.  Read it and see for yourself 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 and the worst president within living memory.  he took the nation into an unnecessary war with Iraq.  National Intelligence Estimates tell us that this war has only made America less safe because it serves to recruit and train jihadists  his fiscal policies benefit the wealthiest two percent while they balloon the national debt.  he has curtailed environmental protections of air and water.  he favors big business and especially big oil at the expense of the working and middle class, who have to pay interest on his bloated deficit.  he cloaks his sinister agenda under a smarmy, self-congratulatory facade of religion that has nothing to do with the Jesus of the bible.    Bush is the right man to prove the adage that you can fool some of the people all the time.  A useful corrective to this book is Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis by Jimmy Carter 
 I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin 
 There's possibly 20 pages of useful information in this book. maybe 15 interesting one 
 Mr. Irving is a renowned writer who has pleased readers with books like, The World According to Garp, Prayer for Owen Meany and Cider House Rules.  There is a creativity about his writing and a quirkiness in his characters that I find appealing.  What happened here?  I was so mired down in wordiness and child sexual abuse that my commitment to the book ended with the protagonist's early grade school sexual experiences.  If somebody walked into a person's home and found drawings of what was verbalized in the book, they would probably consider the individual a pedophile and his home would be marked on public records as housing a pervert.  It seems strange that a brilliant writer could go on ad infinitum, describing the same things in words and be considered worthy of praise.  Anything the book had to offer was lost on me because I couldn't get past being inundated with pages and pages dedicated to pathetic images of a young boy's penis; crude and rude, abusive adolescent girls; and body hair fetish.  Maybe had I been pulled in enough to read further, I would have found redeeming value in Until I find You.  As it played out for me, the book is not worthy of John Irving.       
 I suppose I'm going to be alone in these reviews in complaining loudly about Ellis's stylistic sloppiness.  I recall a particularly amusing section in the introduction in which he describes Jefferson's message in the Declaration as "a recipe for anarchy," and proceeds to note that a government which "attempted to operate in accordance with these principles would be committing suicide."  Yes, Joseph, a government attempting to implement no government would be doing itself in.  Is this what passes for lofty criticism these days?  I picked up this book in an effort to become more interested in--and more fair to--Thomas Jefferson.  I went in believing him to be a cold, conniving man whose life was a long exercise in "do what I say, not what I do."  This book did nothing to change that impression; if anything changed, it was my opinion of Ellis, of whom I'd had somewhat higher hopes.  His writing is not nearly good enough to cover up his attempted slights of hand in excusing Jefferson's worst characteristics; in my book, "psychological agility" isn't distinguished from hypocrisy--it IS hypocrisy.    The book's tone reminded me rather startlingly of the modern theory texts I was once forced to read; full of unprovable suppositions and distinctions without differences.  
 In this book, Mr. Biggs does not discuss the fact that before he left Morgan Stanley he was unmasked as having fabricated comments used in his research reports (claimed to be from his plumber, Ron Valentine) [see NYT, May 21, 2000, Sec 3, p2]. Readers and potential readers of Hedgehogging should, however, remember. It explains the view smart investors have had of Mr. Biggs for some time: he is mildly entertaining, but not someone you should use for serious advice. And above all: never give him any money.  Hedgehogging won't challenge this conclusion for a number of reasons. First, it is about what the author does not say. Nowhere does Mr. Biggs actually detail his hedge fund's strategy or process. His discussion of losses from shorting oil are interesting, but only highlight his lack of thought. Is Mr. Biggs just the public face for Traxis, asking for money for no other reason than he has been around a long time?  It is also about what he does say. Several times Mr. Biggs talks about the "special magic" that it takes to be an investment superstar, most memorably when he talks of the "seeing eye" (p111).  This seems to be his core philosophy. Investment success is not made or created, it just happens to those who succeed.   And it is about his actions. In the end, hedge funds can be judged by only one thing: performance. After initial success with Fairfield Partners, Mr. Biggs does not talk about their returns other than that Fairfield "survived the bear market of the 1970s." He left in 1973. We will all see how Traxis does.  Finally, an attempt to put names to pseudonyms. Most do not precisely match Mr. Biggs' "clues," but many of the details may not be true (remember Ron Valentine). Superstar Ian (p11): J. Kevin Kenny, Jr., Emerging Sovereign Group Grinning Gilbert (p15): Steven Cohen, SAC (fantasy amalgamated with Zalmon Gilbert Simmons) Jock Robinson and Casino Resorts (p35): Robert Wilson and Resorts International Jim the Trigger (p51): Janus alums ala Warren Lammert and Blaine Rollins Peter the Great (p63): Henry Kravis, KKR Tim (p96): Nicolas Roditi The Bearded Prophet of the Apocalypse (p99): Douglas Kass, Seabreeze Julian's Guy (p104): Tiger Cub cocktail with likes of Chase Coleman, Thomas Facciola Dave (p133): David Marvin, Marvin & Palmer Greg from Mega (p192): Leon Cooperman, Omega Judson Thomas and his special Wall Street Journal (ch20):  When first written in 1971, the story was clearly fantasy. But today, it is remarkable how Barton has become Judson. "... a big, beefy middle-aged man, faintly disheveled, his shoes spotted. The face was good - strong, sturdy features arranged honestly - but the eyes had been shot away a long time ago and now there was nobody home a lot of the time... Jud knew all the big names in the game like Kingdon, Cooperman, and Druckenmiller, but they disdained him as a hack." 
 Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles.  That said, this is not the album for that reason.  Do not let this album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about.  There is one hint though in where Radiohead will go.  In the song "Creep", which is not a fantastic song, there is a brilliant "CHU-CHUNK" made by Johnny Greenwood.   SO PLEASE - IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  For the "rockers" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may become obsessed with KID A.  There are some unbelievable songs on AMNESIAC, but it is not their most cohesive album, and HAIL TO THE THEIF is very solid.  Thank you for your time 
 All for One is a poor man's Boyz II Men. They are second-rate and derivative. They aren't original and very bland with their material. Their singing doesn't help matters either, sounding like wounded mice on the edge  of death 
 Kissing Kate was a book I could relate to. In fact, the only reason that I gave it so many stars (2) is due to the fact that I had the same experiences in my own life that the main character is this book has. The problems with this book are from cover to cover. The writing is amateur when it's at its very best. The two girls in the story need much more character development in order for their friendship to be believable and validated, which is probably the books biggest flaw. The author of the story, Lauren Myracle, did not convince me that these two girls were important to each other, although she does make a weak attempt to do just that. I found myself feeling apathetic toward the girls in this story and their inner conflicts. The final disappointment in this book came at the end, where half of my questions were left unanswered. Sometimes things are better left to one's imagination, but not EVERYTHING. Kissing Kate is a depressing book that leaves the reader feeling frusterated. Anyone who wishes to enlighten me with their review of my review may do so. Anyone else who is looking for a great story in this same genre will find one in the pages of Keeping You a Secret by Julie Ann Peters. As for Miss Myracle and her book, she should be thrown in jail for writing it, not paid. Myracle fails, miserably. 
 I am using this as a medium to communicate with you cos I do not know any other since i am new to amazon. It's been a while I purchased your book, so where is my book?  Please take prompt actions 
 I have never seen anything like this before.  A slide presentation (with minimal notes) is all this is, folks. Very disappointing.  I wouldn't have minded if there had been some useful information, but I imagine that King supplies the "missing meat" when he gives his slide presentation.  As it stands, this book leaves me as in the dark as I began.  I was hoping for some illumination (puns intended) on the workings of the energy machine.  Perhaps the sparse notes included here are sufficient to an electrical engineer.  To a mere lay person, the book is opaque.  Too bad!  I hate to write a negative review like this, since I really do support the man's work and this type of research.  It's just unfortunate that this book does little to advance the cause of free energy research, in my opinion.  I'm returning it.  
 I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it.  I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point.  There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance.  While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better 
 I bought this as a gift for my nephew because I loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie.  I'm very glad I screened it first.  The female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow, boring, and illogical.  I'm not very PC with old movies, but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits.  Choose one of the other Disney re-releases instead.  There are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog 
 Save your money, buy a Hallmark Card or a bag of fortune cookies, either of which will dig as deep as this book. 
 I found this book to be very out of date, especially in terms of pricing and logistics in both Dublin and the Dingle area.  I went to Dingle, and found that the hostel they highly recommend as having a free shuttle no longer has a free shuttle or friendly/knowledgeable service.  The hostel with the free shuttle and friendly service was not listed...  Pretty much everything I used this book for was incorrect and I ended up spending much more than the cost of the book due to its errors 
 Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?   
 I disliked the violence Jacques occasionally displayed towards Shea, with his 'insanity' serving as an excuse.  Particularly in the scenes at the beginning of the book, such as where Jacques meets his brother again, the abuse was too much to ever allow Jacques to be a likeable, or even tolerable, character.  This was my least favourite of all her Dark series books 
 Amazing, I read all the reviews and "assumed" the problem with the wrong adapter was resolved since reviewers have complained since 2003. I ordered the Casio CTK 691 keyboard, clicked on the recommended power adapter and trusted the folks at Amazon knew which model I would need. Wrong, it doesn't fit. Since we bought this keyboard to travel this summer it has been very inconvenient, and we haven't had time to resolve it. 
 Despite its appealing title, cover, and organization, this book is nothing more than an Ayurvedic "Helpful Hints from Heloise." I was hoping for something with more depth, not tips (some so silly as "Keep a pitcher of herb tea or sparkling mineral water in the fridge") on how to cram more into an already hectic life. 
 Although I agree with much of what Ms. Seaman writes about synthetic estrogen, (made from mares' urine,) and progestin, (synthetic progesterone), I strongly disagree that all estrogen is potentially "dangerous" to the female body.  (Pls. see Dr. Uzzi Reiss's comments on bio-identical estrogen in his wonderful book, Natural Hormone Balance for Women, in which he, (Dr. Reiss), states: "Currently estrogen is "under attack" as a major risk factor in the epidemic of breast cancer.  I find this ludicrous.  Estrogen is the hormone that distinguishes women's unique gender.  After 2 million yrs. of human evolution, could the female hormone suddently have turned into a serial killer?  Would nature suddenly decide to create a one-gender species?  Of course not.  Incriminating estrogen is as logical as saying that your liver is the cause of liver cancer." (p. 28 of Dr. Reiss's book).  I thoroughly agree with Dr. Reiss.  I, (along with something like 70% of women in menopause), had terrible symptoms of insomnia, lack of energy, lethargic depression, muscle/joint pain, and minor anxiety.  It took me two yrs. of physical symptoms to finally discover bio-identical estrogen, and I consider it a "lifesaver."  It has literally given me back my sense of who I was before menopause.  Within 1-1/2 hrs. of taking the hormone, I became in control of my mind and mood again, regained my stamina, slept better than I had in 2 yrs., and within a few days started to lose the excess wt. I had gained. My recommendation is that in addition to Ms. Seaman's book, readers might like to read Dr. Reiss's book, (from a purely clinician point-of-view,), rather than just a political one. Hooray for Tri-Est!! (name of the bio-identical estrogen formula I used).    
 I'd never heard of Rebecca Campbell before, but the cover of The Marriage Diaries (as well as the name itself) attracted me to pick it up in the store.  The synopsis on the back cover had me in as well as the first few chapters, I might even go as far to say the first hundred pages. Campbell had me sucked in. I laughed a lot at Sean's wit and related to him more than the very self-centered Celeste. She was very disappointing. Towards the beginning though, I felt for her because Sean seemed disinterested in her, but then suddenly after she surprised the *%#@ out of me, I despised her. I felt like I was betrayed by her. As I read on, Sean confused me to no end. His randomness, his lack of self esteem...I could go on and on. I hated both of these characters way before I reached the end. I don't like reading books where the characters are so shallow and self-absorbed. Sometimes, I wondered if Sean and Celeste were really a married couple.   It's been a long time since I've bought a book that I had to skim through. I hated Sean's metaphors. I mean, one or two metaphors are fine, but three, four...? Boring!!! Overall, I was quickly sucked in and then sucked back out just as quickly. I couldn't wait to be rid of it. 
 I usually love JAK books but this book was the dullest book I have ever read. It took me a month to read it when I usually read her books it a 3-5 hour session. I think the reason I did not like it was there was in my opinion too much detail about the dream levels and the heroines family/friends were not likeable. I also think the book missed her trademark sense of humor 
 I stumbled across this CD when I was looking for an Enya-like artist and subsequently bought this CD solely based on other reviews. What a mistake.  The vocal aren't ethereal and the instrumentals are grating.  The worst part is the extensive use of echo and reverb.  I don't know who mixed this album or who approved its use but I am sure they were stoned out of their mind at the time.  If I had to describe it, I would say it is a "punk" version of an Enya wannabe or some other untalented artist, mastered by some guy who passed out on the effects console.  I can't recommend it to anyone, unless maybe you sniff paint fumes for a living. 
 It is movies like this that make me wonder if the writers/directors/producers of these Lifetime movies think about what they are implying before they just fling it up on the screen. Here we have "Odd Girl Out" the story of a high school girl who a popular clique of mean girls turn against and make her life a living hell by calling her fat and easy. And with that basic concept the filmmakers decide to call for fascism all because of their ridiculous slippery slope theory. In the world they live in, to pick on a fellow student leads directly to said student attempting suicide. Further more, their idea of a happy ending is when the principal steps in and outlaws teasing (so much for free speech). Plus, all this is on top of the fact that the victim in question, Vanessa (Alexa Vega), is weak, needy, and straight up duuuuum. The only reason the torture in allowed to endure for the entire film is because she keeps begging for it. Of course the general idea is that she just needs the approval of her peers so much that there is no limit to the amount of times she will let them crush her. Throughout the film the aggressors keep sending her links to a "Hating Vanessa" website. Vanessa, dim bulb that she is, not only takes part in her own abuse by opening them, also acts genuinely shocked by what she finds and bursts out into tears. Late in the film one character makes the fairly obvious observation of "She is so pathetic." This comes after Vanessa has cut off her hair, showed up to a nonexistent party, skipped school to avoid the harassment, and ODed on sleeping pills all while pining to be best friends with the popular girls in school. . .so it goes without saying that I agree with the statement.  The filmmaking itself was textbook Lifetime schlock. They take an issue they don't like and attack it with a stone cold seriousness. It is kind of like a Public Service Announcement only 180 times longer and minus the camp value. I would argue that their fear of anything light does hurt the point they are trying to make. For instance, the girls doing the bullying were painted as spawns of Satan without any appealing qualities. Why would Vanessa want to hangout with these humorless droids. In "thirteen" Nikki Reed's character was at least somewhat cool. It also follows the exact same formula of every other film just like it. Girl has cool friends, cool friends turn against girl, we're supposed to feel bad that girl doesn't get to have cool friends any more. I was a victim of bullying in school (who wasn't) and I think that I am a stronger person now because of it. Our public school system now only peddles uniformity not education, so all these kids can hope to really learn is people skills. How to deal with bullies, office politics, etc. After all, suffering makes us who we are. And for these irresponsible filmmakers to serve up the idea of limiting free speech just to prevent hurt feelings to an audience not known for their free thinking skills is borderline evil **1/4 
 I too read the TA for Tots to my 3-5 year-old 30 years ago.  She loved it a lot so I've been looking for it again, this time for my grand-daughter.  Even though the title is different from the original one I knew, I purchased it and  read it as soon as I received it.  Bottomline: this story is _not_ the original one and I don't like it at all.  Other than showing stereotypical Happy Prince and Princess fairy tale characters (which I can live with up to a point), I saw bunches of red flags when I got to the evil witch, drawn with a full-blown ugly face "who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan".  Unhappy because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies.  Without enough warm fuzzies (we read earlier) it puts people "in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die".  Ouch.  So instead of embracing the wisdom of old women, here we have another story that villifies them (OK, I'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all).  No, it's not funny, and there is no way I would introduce this book to any child.  The book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are, as the original book did.  Too bad, for using images of "warm fuzzies" and "cold pricklies" is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children.  I am returning the book. 
 As a fan of Pete Seeger's music, I bought this CD in the hope that the family connection would ensure similar quality of the music.  Disappointingly, I've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs.  Peggy's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album, as her delivery can best be described as a neo-hillbilly twang.  I may end up combining the best half-dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable "best-of" set, but I'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting.  Only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set; more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of Pete's fine albums such as the Carnegie Hall classic 
 I reviewed this book a few years ago, and I came back to see what meaningful might have been said in the interim. The answer echoes back from the Internet, "Nothing significant." So here are the basic points once again:  1. This book was NOT originally written by Kenneth Hagin. It was written by CMA minister and missionary John A. MacMillan as "The Authority of the Believer." Hagin's original book had the exact same title.  2. Not only did the book have the same title, it had - literally - most of the exact same words, the only exceptions being the self-authenticating stories that were a Hagin specialty.  3. This is the book where Hagin claims that he cast out a demon that was interfering with a personal message from 'Jesus.' Jesus looked at Hagin and said, "If you hadn't done that, I couldn't have done anything about it." Jesus COULDN'T have done anything about it? I'm guessing the cessationists are right: Jesus somehow lost his zip over the last 2,000 years. I mean, that raising from the dead was easy compared to casting out an alleged demon - if Hagin is to be believed.  Do you believe him? If so, why? This book is a man-centered attempt to justify one man's heretical theology based ENTIRELY on two things: plagiarism (theft) and unverifiable stories. The obvious answer to the 'do you trust him' question is clearly yes in the case of a few of the reviewers.  One reviewer said: "Whether John Macmillan, E.W. Kenyon or whoever wrote this type of a book first is irrelevant." This is a straw man, pure and simple. I didn't say that one of those others was the first to write this 'type of book;' I said the author cited on this page STOLE it. Big difference, wouldn't you say?  Another reviewer writes: "Yes, let every Christian be hesitant to critique this teaching since Jesus not only gave us His authority, but sacrificed his very life for it."  I'm guessing he got this from the Kenneth Hagin claim that everybody who rejected his message would die a premature death. Needless to say, I have had numerous sleepless nights the last several years - NOT!! I'm also guessing this reviewer never bothered to read the BIBLE - since Jesus told me to 'test everything.'  This same reviewer said, "(although some serious allegations have been succesfully defeated in The True Story by McIntyre)." For anyone who believes this, go read my critique of McIntyre's dangling participles and mis-citations.               
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 "Heist" is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a "who fools who?" picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid 
 This album is way overated, let me tell you why.  Wack MC: MF Doom is a bad rapper, not the worst, just bad. He can flow but his rymes are weak, corny, and somtimes it doesnt make sense at all. The corniest ryme I heard was- "We rock the house like rock 'n roll/ got more soul Than a sock with a hole." LMAO! It gets worse "Take it from the Tec-9 holder/ They bit and dont know they neck shine from shinola" What is he talking about??? He is not a genius MC, Nas is, he is even worse than Aesop Rock. Which they rap with words and dont even make any sense.  Filler: This Cd has too much filler, they have like 10 songs that last only 50 secs. Some of them is not even neccasary.  Average Beats: The beats are either average or just sucks. I can make better beats on Fruity Loops. However Track 22 "Rhinestone Cowboy" had the best beat on the entire album. The beat was hot to tell you the truth, but that only gives it one star.  Overall this album sucks, just download "Rhinestone Cowboy" and call it a day. I think Madlib can make good beats its just that he didnt show it here. I dont recommend this album, if you want a good album get Mos Def "Black on Both Sides" It 10x better than this 
 Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.  There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.  The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.  The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.  In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex 
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 Ballard makes several keen insights in this book (many of them startlingly prescient).  However, digging those nuggets of clarity out of the surrounding mess is difficult and often unrewarding work.  The repetetive and disjointed nature of the narrative quickly leads to confusion--confusion about the characters, their motives, and the surrounding events.  And perhaps that was intentional, but it doesn't make for a satisfying read.  "The Assasination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race" was one of the few bright spots in the narrative, but not quite bright enough for me to consider this book as anything more than a failed experiment 
 So Dreher wants us to go back to sitting on our porches, chatting with our neighbors every night, growing our own food locally, and shunning the free-market. How easy it is to fall for the 'we were so much happier when we lived like this' mumbo-jumbo. How soon we forget the plagues, infant mortality, lack of sanitation, short lives, a trip to the dentist without anesthesia, and more.  Dreher is just another journalist who gets his economic knowledge from the equally ignorant Paul Krugman. It's the free-market that has provided the wealth that has allowed Dreher to make the 'voluntary' decision to live the way he does. The free market is all voluntary decisions by millions of individual buyers and sellers. Contrast this with what he defines it as, that what we have spewing out of Washingon DC, such as NAFTA. If there has to be pages upon pages of who we can trade with, and what we are allowed to trade, then that is not the free-market, but cleverly disguised socialism that ignorant people continue to fall for.  Do I have a problem with the way Dreher lives? Absolutely not, that is his free-will. But when he attempts to get in the long line of people who want to impose their way on everyone else, that's when I would tell him to take a hike 
 There is some very helpful information in here about how a woman's cycle works. I would be very cautious, however, about the nutrition information. Here is my story:  I was ovulating every 16-18 days with a 11-day luteal phase. Hoping to ovulate closer to every 14 days and lengthen my luteal phase, I began taking the vitamin Optivite, so heavily recommended in the book. I took Optivite for four months, and in that time I would either ovulate extremely late--30+ days followed by a 9 or 10 day luteal cycle-- or NOT AT ALL.   For whatever reason, I didn't immediately connect my ovulation problems with taking the Optivite (seems so obvious now). Then I read something from another source about how excess vitamin A can inhibit ovulation. I then QUIT taking Optivite. My first cycle off of Optivite, my ovulation returned to normal-- and THAT IS WHEN I FINALLY GOT PREGNANT.  It may be that Optivite has helped other women who were really deficient in some of those vitamins. But, in my case, I guess I was healthy to begin with, and it just screwed with my body 
 Not Poddy and Midge again, I thought musical hall jokes like this had been confined to history.  Still all the unsold copies will be welcome down in New Orleans shoring up some dyke, unless she tries to get elected 
 This wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid won't stay closed.  I waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table.  The wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid.  Don't buy this wipe warmer, there are better ones out there. 
 How do you spell 'sucks'? Easy - A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R!  I loved Stone's JFK, but this... Words fail me, but I'll try to find a few. Okay, the pros? Angelina Jolie. I've never been a big fan of hers, but, boy, was she the hottest woman alive in this movie! More pros? Hmmm. Certainly not the action sequences which were muddled and hard to follow. Certainly not the weird Irish accents the lead characters adopted. Certainly not the story.  This is just one of those films you believe can be so bad and that something cool is gonna happen the instant you hit the off button, so it stays your finger. My advice? HIT THAT BUTTON!  And I won't even mention the blonde wig! 
 Ok,  I bought their 4 bag combo special which feature all their flavors back when their site was taking orders direct.  This jerky is not very good.  In fact, I threw away about half of it because some of the pieces where very thick and hard.  Kind of like eating leather and plastic mixed in together.  Trust me when people say this : there is MUCH BETTER jerky out there.  I even e-mailed the company and told them that I was very unsasfied with thier jerky.  They offered me a refund and I should of taken it, but I decided not to 
 Roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better.  Based on the theories of David Ricardo, the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible.  In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs.  Fables like The Choice (or the "free-market economy" for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple.  That's why the book is dangerous.  The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world, but it sounds good.  The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable.  If you buy Roberts' version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue.  Roberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well.  Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong 
 I had seen this book cited in many other books and so was expecting something useful. Man, was I disappointed. This book seemed to be written from an academic perspective of deconstructionism, of trying to make a name for yourself by upsetting the existing order, and by blowing things out of proportion and presenting them as great problems to be exposed, i.e. "straw men". For anyone interested in the genuine teachings and practice, or even historical developments and research, there are a lot of better books 
 Forget this greatest hits CD collection it's not the best just get Joe Cocker's anthology you'll thank me when you do 
 This book was poorly written. Its plot was somewhat implausible and the characters were anything but dynamic. It seemed more like a screenplay thinly disguised as a novel, as it possessed very little literary merit. I would not recommend this book to anyone who values his or her leisure time 
 This book is not as good as i thought it would be.  I hope i have better readings with Bryan Tracy's Advance selling 
 This desk is okay if you don't move it around, but if you move it the desk part ,that is attached to the chair, it moves and then kind of rubs on the chair leaving marks 
 For those already aware of Buddhist or New Age principles, this book might serve as a pleasant reinforcement. If you seek a deeper truth, you'll be disappointed by the cooing stories of the author's grandmother. The ideas, like accepting what is and living in the moment, are sound in my experience, but the presentation strikes me as infantile. A luxurious use of ink and space make for an attractive book, suitable for a coffee table or waiting room 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
    I find Dr. Gabriel account of Islam to be disturbing. For one thing, the Quran tells his we have to believe in the revelations before the last revelation the Quran was revealed. Islam is the perfected religion, as said in the Quran. Dr. Gabriel speaks about contradictions then becomes a Christian. The Bible has been manipulated, altered, and purposely changed to suit the likes of Kings of there time. I once was a Christian, and ALL PRAISES DUE TO ALLAH, that I found Islam on my own after 9/11. The Quran tells us Muslims to submit to Islam on earth, do good deed, perform prayer (remembrance of ALLAH, the most Gracious and Merciful), and refrain from sin in order to receive Heaven in the Hereafter. To use Alcohol, as a meaning for contradiction is absurd. Alcohol and sin as we all know cause us to transgress against ALLAh and ourselves. I am sure AllAH knows the reason for abstaining Alcohol on earth. I am sad for Christians who were once Muslims only because christians believe Jesus is God, the son of God, and the holy spirit. When the first commandment clearly states: You Shall Have No Other Gods Before Me, yet christians share divinity with Jesus and a spirit. This is the reason for anger when people convert to other beliefs. There is only one GOD, and his name is ALLAH. Stop using the actions of some muslims to discredit Islam, for the Muslims who choose to act in barbaric ways will be judged by ALLAH, and ALLAH alone. Dr. Gabriel is a well-educated man, and I only pray that he would not compare Islam with Terrorism.   
 An excellent book for the same pretentious, self-congratulatory grown-ups who give themselves little kisses of self regard for their Channel 13 memberships and who shiver with uncontrollable pleasure at the very mention of "culture," or "art." Children, however, will be, as mine was, and I was, bored.  My child is too young to also have been repelled by Tony Kushner's fake, artsy-fartsy poeticisms that make reading the book out loud a tedius struggle, though he was not too young to have wondered, as I did, if an actual STORY was going to begin at some point. A good reliable general rule of thumb, especially where children's books are concerned, is that when critics fling about raves involving high school lit terms like "allegory" the cautious reader without a lot of loose pocket change will walk on by.  THE WILD THINGS, for eg, is a great book that hasn't got much of a story story, but that has a LOGIC and a story type rythym and language that doesn't try to force the ball out of the park 
 Denzel Washington and Bob Hoskins tested many critics' high opinion of them by co-starring in this awful supernatural comedy. Hoskins is a racist cop with a weak heart. Washington is a slick lawyer who dies and has his  heart transplanted into Hoskins. Denzel's ghost haunts Hoskins. Picture  "Watermelon Man" and "All of Me" combined, and done stupidly. The low point  comes when Hoskins awakes after his operation and finds a huge black dildo  his prankster buddies have planted in his pajamas. The two antagonists must  work together to catch Denzel's murderers and save Hoskins' hooker  sweetheart Chloe Webb. Denzel won his Oscar for "Glory" not long before  this was released; if not for that, it probably would've gone straight to  video. It would be a waste of time and money even to rent this (never mind  buy it) to see for yourself how bad it is 
 Let me state right now that I didn't finish the book--I put it down as soon as the Purple Gentian made the stupid remark about Amy's kissable neck.  I couldn't care less about whether the book is faithful to the period setting or whether the characters are able spies.  It's just badly written 
 I had a pair of Jensen headphones that were similar to these that got worn out and broke on the side (wish I remembered the model # but they're long gone in the trash) so I thought i'd get another pair of Jensens because the others sounded great.  Boy was I wrong, these headphones sound like complete garbage, the treble is horrible, the bass is horrible, everything, these are worse than the trashy earbud style headphones I got with my mp3 player. Pay a few extra bucks and buy something else because you'll end up trashing these and getting something else anyway like I did 
 This book is good in many ways, but it has some serious flaws.     Verrier says "in the past" parents were coerced into surrendering their tiny relatives for adoption. Does she really believe that there is no coercion today? With all the adoption businesses, the "Dear Birthmother" solicitation,  the federally-funded Infant Adoption Awareness Training and related advertising to get more babies for adoption customers?  Are the moms and dads and grandparents today required to be advised of the emotional risks of separating infants from their mothers (which is what Verrier writes about) before surrendering their relative?      Verrier herself is coercive:  She refers to true relatives as "birth" relatives.   Euphamisms like "birth" mother, "birth" child, "sperm donors", "egg donors", "traditional surrogate" help to hide the reality - that these are actual relatives -  mothers, fathers, sons and daughters.   Hiding the reality helps when adoption and infertility businesses are intent on getting more babies - and the raw materials to make babies - for their clients.  Another troubling issue with this book is the way Verrier tells mothers to "forgive" others for pressuring them into adoption. It makes sense to forgive those who were/are naive and had no idea of the serious impacts of separating true family members.   But it is frustrating for a mother or father whose child has been used for infant adoption to be advised to "forgive" the entities that STILL promote family separation.  Those entities (in many cases) were well aware of the problems with separating mothers and babies - even as far back as the 1960s. And yet so many of them still are working to destroy families that are not of the "family-unit" family type or else they are simply focused on getting babies for customers.   
 Iles tries to imitate Michael Crichton with bits of Dan Brown's Digital Fortress in this book.  Unfortunately this book does not make it.  The NSA is backing a project called Trinity which is to develop a super quantum computer that is controlled by a brainscan of a human mind.  Two of the individuals involved with the project want it halted and one dies in an apparent stroke which was actually induced by the NSA bad guys (why does the NSA always have to be portrayed as the bad guys in these books?).  David Tennant is the other individual and he gets away by stopping an unstoppable hitman and then persuades his psychiatrist to run with him, even though she thinks he is mentally unstable.  The plot really gets out of hand with Tennant having visions of being Jesus, being portrayed to the Secret Service as the next Oswald and escaping the entire Washington DC police and SWAT units and ultimately getting out the country with a false passport, going to Israel and then persuading the head of the Moussad to help him.  As crazy as it sounds the end is literally unbelievable that would even make a James Bond fan cringe.  The author has written some great tense books (24 Hours, Sleep No More) so I just chalk this one up to an experiment gone awry. 
 I thought the decorating ideas in this book were TACKY! I would never use any of them in my home. I got the feeling this author was on a publishers "payment due timeline" and had no idea about the inside of a home. Martha really has raised the bar. This book was a disappointment 
 I asked for a popcorn popper for Christmas, and got this.  I had wanted an AIR POPPER, but maybe I wasn't specific when I asked.  Anyway, being a Cuisinart product, I thought it must be good.  Also, my cousin has an oil popper (different brand) that makes great popcorn, so I thought I'd try it.  Steam collects in the lid/bowl making wet popcorn.  Some of the popcorn burnt, even with the spinner device, because the popcorn stayed on the heat plate for too long after it popped - it can't all be on top of the pile.  I still tried to eat the finished popcorn (the unburnt, less wet pieces) and it had a terrible texture sort of too hard - stale maybe - but it was fresh corn.  Plus, even with lots of butter and salt, it had sort of a strange taste - sort of chemically maybe?  The manual even said something about chemicals needing to burn off during the first few uses (and I even washed it before I used it because of the possibility of that).  Lastly, even though it is non-stick, it was difficult to clean the cooked on oil off of the heat plate.  THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT EVER FOR SO MANY REASONS: FLAWED DESIGN, LACK IN EASE OF CLEANING, OVERALL PERFORMACE, AND THE TERRIBLE END PRODUCT!  I ended up feeding the popcorn to my dog - at least SHE seemed to like it.  I AM SERIOUSLY SHOCKED AT THE POOR QUALITY OF THIS ITEM.  I CANNOT BELIEVE CUISINART LET IT ON THE MARKET.  HOW ON EARTH DID IT PASS THEIR TEST KITCHENS?  I wanted a popcorn maker so badly and now I am stuck with a piece of junk.  Compared to that batch of popcorn, I'd rather eat the raw kernals straight out of the bag 
 If you are looking for help working your way through a new loc journey, (what to use, how to do it etc.) this book is not for you. If your doing research on the history of loc'd hair, with lots of personal convictions - this book is for you. If you have made the decision to loc your hair, you probably already have your own convictions - you don't need to buy them from a stranger. . I was so disappointed that with this book, I actually tossed it in the trash - something I almost never do.  
 The author missed the point of a quiet life which is that you just do it and enjoy it --- you don't call your friends to do it with you and stop when they cancel.  Another reviewer of Bender's work said that she in "in her head too much" and I completely agree. Stop thinking SO much - just enjoy life - your family. Stop making lists. Stop degrading yourself for the simple process of taking care of yourself, your family and your house. 
 This version  is a disaster. My expectations were dashed to pieces..No life. No emotion..An elevater rendition. .It is a joy that I have original (vinal) recording which is a near  masterpiece in movie music 
      I did not see the kind of detail I would expect from an escort with 18 years experience.  You would expect that she could fill the book with remarkable anecdotes.  Instead she will give examples of her husband's behavior!  She talks about men who are ignorant and need advice about how to please a woman in bed.  Her clients are all in love with their wives!  It is quite a dull book of very banal sexual advice from a conventional woman's perspective.  I am concerned if women should try to understand men using the author's "experience".  Men will simply be bored 
 Can't Rate This Because I Never Recieved It. Ordered It 2 Months Ago, My Credit Card Was Charged But I Have Not Recieved The Item. Actions Will Follow !!!!!! 
 Not only is this negative about being a parent for the second time it's very anti-breastfeeding and anti-natural birth.  I basically says that pregnant nursing and tandem nursing is a bad idea. At one point 4 of the 5 nursing "personal accounts" are very negative. In the breastfeeding vs. formula section she completely fails to mention that breastmilk is full of nutrients that cannot be duplicated by formula. I'm not a breastfeeding fanatic but the book was in no way even handed with the way that it was treated.    The entire book is very passive aggressive and at one point made me feel like I was being a bad mom, until I snapped out of it. This is what she says about choosing a nurse-midwife. "If you think not using all the technology available would represent poor care of your unborn child, then choosing a midwife is probably not advised." pg. 25   I will be returning it for something a little more fairly presented 
 I wore these slippers for about one week.  One morning while wearing them, my right foot felt like the material inside the shoe was twisted.  I looked down at the shoe to see what the problem was, and much to my surprise, part of my foot was hanging out the side of the slipper!  The seam had split where the top and side were stitched together.  Very disappointed 
 i feel that this program uses vocabulary that should not be introduced to children as primary words when beginning a foreign language. it talks of ghosts, witches and other "scarey" things. i just don't feel that  those words are constructive, but that other positive more essential topics  could have been chosen to sing and learn about 
 As it says in the title this book is a lipogram (and dictionary.com gives us this definition: A writing composed of words not having a certain letter or letters.)  It is a very neat idea and the book creates a clever way of making the structure part of the story itself.  However, it reminds me of communism in that in theory it sounds incredibly good...but in actuality it is a failure.  Everything about the story from plot to characters is boring and 2 dimensional.  There's no development beyond the basic lipogrammatic theme and that gets old after a while.  Espeically since after more and more letters go away the book just gets written with alternate spellings using the remaining allowable letters.  And even at 200 pages it went on too long.  It was too repetitive.  I appreciated the author's love for language, but at times that even got annoying because it felt forced.  (although I was happy to find a book with interesting new vocabulary in it!)  In short, I give credit for the idea but I would not really reccomend you read this book 
 A recent positive review of Mr. Watson's latest non fiction book, brought me to this fiction book. I was hoping to combine the fun of  a mystery with the interesting facts of the art trade. I found none. The story is extremely boring, badly written, and there is more supspense in opening a jar of jam than in this entire book. The characters are predictable, the action slow. Was this book published without an editor  
 I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.  The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.  Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie 
 This book is about nothing. But not the funny kind of nothing as in Seinfeld.  If you read the back of this book, you get the impression that this woman takes revenge on the people in the streets making all the noise.  Let me save you the suspense, she does NOTHING!  All she does is complain complain complain, and in the end she finally loses it and, oh my, throws a few eggs out the window that don't even hit the perpetrators. They land on the street. Nothing is resolved at all, there's no plot, there's random jokes all through the book that start out corny and then become unneccessarily offensive and very inappropriate (since when are incest jokes funny?) not to mention annoying when you're trying to figure out why this book was even written. It's important to note that half of everything in this book never happens.  It's all about what this woman "would do if..." and "then she would say..."   Well,if I "would" have known that I'd gain nothing from reading this book, I "would" never have bought it in the first place 
 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13  Put your faith in the bible and Gods words NOT THROUGH SHAKTI GAWAIN  Trust Jesu 
 Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep 
 Two readings straight through, back to back, and I still couldn't figure out what anyone sees in this overwrought piffle 
   I watched this movie with two people who consider it a comedy classic and was "udderly" bored.  The acting was horrible, the plot was boring, and the comedy was very thin indeed.  Watch this if you must on mute.  The scenery is great and if you like to see old geezers fumbling young half nude girls, this one's for you 
 I turned to this book as possible first-hand source material for a seminar on violence and enculturation in modern America.  What did I come away with?  A whining, immature rant about how things aren't "his fault".  Society made them do it.  Instead of the lucid expose that so many of these reviews promise, this book presents us with a whining, tattling exercise that does no service to anyone or anything, and serves only to feed the self-serving desires of the author.    The prose is itself slang-ridden and nearly impossible to read.  One wonders whether this is the work of the co-author, trying to make the piece seem edgy and relevant.  It ultimately acts only as an off-putting, succeeding in alienating the reader, making it difficult for us to form a closeness: though we might wish to.  A tragedy such as this is deserving of a far better voice than is provided by this book. 
 Amazon did not disclose that this is a blank note book. this is VERY WRONG. Now I have to go to the trouble of returning it. And in TOP OF THAT, I was alerted by an e-mail to pre-order it, leading me to believe this was a new book...!!!  Why is Amazon resorting to such methods?? 
 You know, I don't think this author's or any author's physical appearance is either here or there. And please, let's not take ridicule for "ardent hatred". If you fed an English dictionary into a computer program that generated random permutations, one of the more improbable combinations of words it might spit out could be: "as if pointing out the sexual agenda in the 9th Symphony needed an apology". "The sexual agenda in the 9th Symphony" 
 This would be a great tube, except it forces you to sit up in an uncomfortable position.  Unless you're worried about your posture when hanging out at the lake, find another tube 
 If you have to choose between this book and Thin Tastes Better (by the same author), buy Thin Tastes Better. This book, while it has a few recipes, is mostly a retread of the information in the other book.    Two things were particularly annoying: 1) his insistence that you banish foods you have a problem overeating completely from your life, thereby reinforcing the belief that  the food is in control and not you; and 2) constant mentioning by brand name of "diet" foods that have ingredients and additives that are objectionable to many people looking for healthy food. It would have been better to just mention what you should look for in quality healthy diet fare.  Mentioning brand names also makes the book dated when items go out of production and are no longer available.  Borrow from the library to read, or buy used 
 I ordered this book as a gift and found it completely unsuitable because of the photo on the backcover. The gift was intended for a father of 2 small children; he certainly would not want a book with a cover photo of a  man with a vulgar word written on his forehead and making a vulgar gesture.  Neither one of us is a prude, but this is something you don't want around  children. I only wish that Amazon could let customers know what the back  cover looks like in cases like this. I wasted money and time! I'm sure the  inside content would have been interesting, but a coffee table book's  cover--back AND front--need to be suitable for public consumption 
 The camera (Canon S-80) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card, much less a second battery pack or the charger. I ended up using my old Tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories. Total waste of $$$ 
 First off, the problem with this book is that people jump to conclusions too quickly.  If I say that discrete math is not the same as continuous math, yet I go on to point out that the Z-Transform is analogous to the LaPlace Transform, there is an inherent ambiguity, a diaelectric, that seems contradictory but makes sense:  all models are just that, models to reality.  And reality cannot be modeled exactly (even the Theory of Relativity has flaws, which physicists are exploring today).  In medicine for example, Grey's Anatomy, a medical textbook, has been criticized for showing a 'perfect' anatomy that does not in fact exist in nature.  Analogously, the old argument about which classical statute was 'better':  classical Greek or Roman?  Ideal or 'real'? (and if 'real', whose 'real'; the recent statute in Trafalger square showing a paraplegic pregnant woman comes to mind)?  The point being that classical economics is not perfect, nor is it flawed--it just is.  Come up with a better model, and the economic world will beat a path to your doorstep.   BTW, I've not read this book.  Please recommend this review if it's been helpful. 
 This is one of the most tediously judgmental biographies I've read in a long, long time. D. J. Taylor spends most of his time correcting or chiding or simply doubting Orwell. He sifts through "Such, Such Were the Joys" determined to prove that Orwell exaggerated how unhappy he was in school. He defends the families that Orwell characterized in ROAD TO WIGAN PIER as if this were a legal brief and not some of the most vivid prose in English literature. He discusses the great essay "Shooting an Elephant" solely in terms of whether it's literally true or not. And so on. Asking a few questions of the material is one thing, but Taylor grinds on and on and on.   He is so determined not to let Orwell get away with anything that this book never achieves any dramatic or narrative momentum. The only bits of life are the short snapshot chapters that describe Orwell's voice, say, or his face. And Taylor flubs long stretches of the story. His pages on the background to the Spanish Civil War and the factional fighting in Barcelona are total gibberish. I had to pull out a couple of other books to find out what exactly was going on. It was at this point I decided to stop reading.  For all their faults, the Bernard Crick, Stansky/Abraham, and even the Michael Shelden are better, more readable biographes. 
 Definately doesn't live up to What to Expect the First Years.  Somethings are written very vaguely, if at all.  Recently we were looking up hives - nothing!!!!  Just a blurb.  Sorry Arlene Eisenberg, you need to take your time with these books and include everything before you just send it to the presses 
 This book champions the case of plural identities & builds on many examples from different histories to highlight how any other way of socio-politico-cultural categorization is or has been misleading.    That & that alone, is the primary message of the book. It is disappointing to read Sen stressing this one basic idea over & over again in different contexts & with different examples throughout this book. Sure, there are ramifications of this one basic idea but they're, at best, common-sensical & Sen does not have any new insight or theory that he builds on.   The text is dry & the style archaic. As in his other books, history has been used selectively to highlight a point, never mind if that event was of any political or social consequence.   If you've read other books by Sen, or you're the kind who takes an interest in socio-economic & political matters, you'll find that this book does little to either sharpen your insight into aspects of our world or indeed build a new school of social analysis.   This book is intellectually sterile.   S! 
 If you follow this book, people mey be happy with the person they meet-but it won't be you 
 This book is 80% verbage and 20% needed information. The ratio is similar to that you might get from listening to bloated bureacrat explain federal regulations for the purchase of government pencils.   The worst part about this book is that upon first reading, it actually seems to contain information. You don't realize how much verbage there is until it comes time to take a nursing test.   Don't listen to these other reviewers. Avoid this book at all costs. I've spent hours poring over a single chapter only to find a shorter more compact book that got the info across in ten minutes. 
 This was a cute book, but enough with the detailed descriptions! It was as if the author couldn't come up with enough words to fill her  contract, so had to fill in with exhaustive lists of every food item Holly had for dinner, including how it was prepared. I found myself skipping over entire paragraphs of stuff because it added absolutely nothing to the story. In one part there was like a page and a half of her making SALAD for dinner! And reporting on EVERY.SINGLE.TIME she checked her e-mail? Give it a rest! I get that she checks her e-mail frequently!  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. I managed to get through it to the extremly predictable ending by sheer stubborn will, but I won't be looking for this author's books again 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 Toyer maintains no rhythym or flow throughout the entire novel.  The only thing that keeps the reader interested is the interesting, demented storyline that is truly different from any other suspense novel that I have ever read.  Toyer is a criminal in Los Angeles.  But Toyer doesn't kill anyone.  He simply invades the homes of young, beautiful women and lobotomizes them.  This essentially makes them vegetables, and the book's characters claim that Toyer can only be charged with "criminal mayhem." (Not sure how true that is...)  The main characters of the novel are Maude Garance, a physiatrist at the medical center which treats the victims of Toyer, and Sara Smith, a reporter for the Los Angeles Herald, which is the first and foremost source of new Toyer information for all residents of LA.    The funny thing is that for a book that had "a novel of suspense" written right on the cover; there is absolutely no suspense at all.  The novel consists mostly of some sort of contrived, convoluted look at the media and the way it portrays criminals.  You know the whole ordeal.  Are we making him a celebrity?  Is this ethically correct to be reporting?  Been there, done that, and I'm not any more interested this time than I was before.  I originally read this book because I saw online that Brian De Palma has written a screenplay and intends to make a film out of the novel.  If he does go through with it, in order for it to be a good film, I hope he changes almost every aspect completely 
 I was really happy when I finally found them. We bought the Chicco flip'n'play earlier, which comes with 14 great Chicco blocks, all in different shapes and my 9 months old loved to play with them - and we built all kind of things together. I wanted to enlarge our options and ordered (waited forever, which is not part of my product review! but anyway) these blocks, assuming that they have at least some different sizes, allowing more creativity, but these 36 pieces only come in 3 shapes - 2x2 blocks, 3 pieces 2x6 bridge shape and about 4 pieces 2x2 with an angle on top (for roofs). So I am a little disappointed.  On the bag are printed some different shapes. But unfortunately, they are not in there and I couldn't find some extension sets with other sizes 
 After a long wait for this book I was disappointed to find it not the authors normally great work.  The writing style was choppy and hard to follow.  The was plot weak and the content not very interesting 
 I had previously written a review here charging Mr. Levenda with poor scholarship and libelous treatment of Mr. Aleister Crowley and "his occult orders," it has developed, on my own faulty memory of an article written by another author.  The irony of my accusing Mr. Levenda of inaccuracy based on my own forgetfulness has not been lost on me, and has been a gentleman in correcting my error.  I would like to apologize to Mr. Levenda for my thoughtlessness and plan on buying his -- I'm sure -- excellent book in reparation to him.  
 If you're like me and think that mathematics is great fun, then the idea of having a calendar with a new problem for each day probably sounds pretty intriguing. Indeed, this could be a great product if done well. But the calendar has several shortcomings.   For one, many (most?) of the problems test knowledge rather than intelligence. For example, one problem shows a subtraction problem with one number written in Mayan numerals and the other written in Chinese. Now, if you recognize Mayan and Chinese numbers, this problem requires no thought whatsoever. If you don't, no amount of puzzling will avail you. Another asks, "If 100 quadrillion is written in scientific notation, you get 10^?" This is the same sort of thing. Mathematics should be about reasoning, not trivia. Particularly when each problem has the date as its solution, meaning that questions like the last are more statements of fact than questions.  My other problem with it is that it isn't presented very well. There's a lack of consistency in its formatting that suggests that it was thrown together somewhat haphazardly, and it's littered with typographical and mathematical errors. The question for January 19, for example, asks the reader to translate the hexadecimal number F4 into decimal. Aside from fitting my earlier complaint about this being a mere trivia question, anyone who knows hex will tell you that the answer is 244, not 19. The calendar has a page of errata buried on the publisher's atrociously bad website, but really, this is the sort of thing that should have been spotted instantly -- BEFORE the product went into circulation.  Looking around Amazon at some of Pappas' other products, many reviews seem to complain that they reflect a very low editorial standard, and I think this is the case with the 2006 Mathematics Calendar too. It's a great idea and does have a few interesting problems in it, but for the most part it's a disappointment. Stay away from this one 
 The setting-sometime in the near future.  The premise-a family man who is making a space repisintation of the box, only to find out that an ancestor of his made the original box that unleased the hell demons that we know so well.  Give it a break, the future and evil demons have been done before. Give it a rest.   A poorly thought and unoriginal movie about a man who is trying to close the gates to hell.  This sound familiar?  If it doesn't don't even consider watching this horrible movie 
 What ever happened to common sense? In this book the average American doesn't exist. I am not denying the problems that exist in the inner cities. I am denying that this is life for the average American or even the average non-white American. Comparing two extremes - best case vs. worst case is always going to give you an unrealistic picture. We live in a capitalist economy, there will always be haves and have-nots. What he is pushing for is a socialist or communist system where everyone is equally miserable and those that manage to get ahead are then forced to pay the way for those who can't or won't. Hey Mr. Kozol - last time I checked there was no army on the borders of Camden or East St. Louis keeping people from moving out, and there is noone forcing anyone to accept the lifestyle they were born into. He offers a view of the problems with no real solution except maybe to hate the rich - Mr. Kozol, how much money did you get paid to write this book?? Utter liberal garbage. Conveniently leaves most of American schools totally out of the equation, only focusing on the worst cases and then comparing them to the top schools in the nation. 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 Its made of flimsy plastic, and all the parts snap on. I'm afraid to put a heavy book on there, because I'm sure the parts will just snap off 
 I dont recommend this PDF Documen its very expensive, ITs better the phisical book, I want this document in the meantime my phisical book is arriving, I got the book two days after, and I couldnt read the ebook the service I received throug AMAZON was very bad, they tell they can send the documento to your email but that is not true, they dont give me my money back 
 "Don't Look Now" is just one of many pointless, non-thriller, lackluster, poorly written short stories by Daphne du Maurier.  I could not find a point in any of the five stories, and they all left me feeling empty.  "Don't Look Now" was completely dim-witted and anti-climatic (as were all the stories).  "The Breakthrough" did make me question science and at how much we want to live, but the characters were flat and lifeless.  "Not After Midnight" felt like it was going on a downward spiral to nowhere land, without a point to be found.  "A Border-Line Case" left me feeling repulsed and wondering what du Maurier was trying to say.  "The Way of the Cross" made me wonder if du Maurier's way of thinking is that God gives people their comeuppance; I found the shifting narrator to be irksome and it showed how little the author gave her characters varying personalities.  I closed this book realizing, that after these stories, along with "Rebecca," that du Maurier has a very monotone and bland style of writing; she often goes of on pointless tangents.  "Pointless" is the ever returning word when speaking of du Maurier's writing.  I do not recommend 
 like the other reviewer, i don't think i got the correct filters. i didn't open mine, but these don't look like the typical filters with the familiar monitor on top. i've heard rumors that the filters with the monitor are no longer being produced, but i hope not... i chose to return this item and purchase a dented box item which i hope are the correct filters. if PUR stopped making the monitored pitchers, i'm gonna be very upset...  IN ADDITION, the description on the box i received said that these filters are for water coolers and bottles - it said NOTHING about compatibility with pitchers, unlike the description.  UPDATE 4/16/2007: i contacted PUR regarding the filter compatility. the company says that all newer pitchers accept the CRF-950Z. however, since june 2006, the filters "no longer have the u-shaped life indicator on the top." and that SUCKS. maybe it didn't work well, but i suspect financial incentives for that elimination. the email came from [...] - we should all complain 
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 For a class that I'm taking, we were asked to read one book from the American Library Association's 2007 Best Books for Young Adults list. Clay was the first one, seeing as how they're in alphabetical order by author's last name.  I have struggled through 86 pages and I'm giving up. Where is the book located? Somewhere where they speak English, but not the American way. When is the book set? At one point, I thought it was the 60s, but I'm not sure. What is the book about? Nothing interesting.  Perhaps the book is just too deep for me. But here's my question: I'm 23 years old, with a college degree and plenty of practical life experience. If it's too deep for me, what 16-year-old is going to read it 
 Looks nice. Unfortunately did not power up the camera, so I can't say much else. Going to cost me return shipping at the very least. Sorry I didn't buy the Canon product instead 
 Bought this on a clearance rack and can now see why it hadn't sold.  The characters were unexciting, and the story dragged on and on.  I read 4 books while having this one unfinished on my night stand.  I've never read any of Allison's other novels, but after reading this one, I don't think I'll jump on the chance.  Dede was the most interesting character, and even she couldn't keep me involved.   
 I purchased this book as an experienced homebrewer interested in branching out (I also bought The Compleat Meadmaker, which is excellent and helpful). I was *sorely* disappointed. It has nothing of value to teach about brewing of hard ciders. It does have lots of Foxfire-type info on building a cider press, planting an orchard, choosing cultivars, etc.  But there is no real guidance for fermenting cider beverages.  If you have a farm and want to press sweet cider, this would seem to be a good book. But if you are interested in "something a little harder," look elsewhere (wish I knew where!) 
 This book is dripping with the worst kind of technology hype...  Very few redeeming qualities...  Don't waste your time/$ 
 For the money it is okay - but sems to need constant adjustment.  Would set it for a channel then come bak later in the day and needed to adjust again 
 I am an Oil professional - 30 years in drilling and production. This book is very timely - we are running out of oil - All the major oilfields are in decline. New (significant) oilfields are not being found. As this progresses it will be a very big change of life.  The author repeats and repeats the same ideas with few facts. Saudi keeps it technical information private. I was disappointed with this book. : 
 With the experience and access of Dick Couch that is touted on the inside flap, I expected something more than what I got. This is a very "novelly" non-fiction book that is light on new or original information, and heavy on the compliments.  SEALs, some of our best and bravest, have withstood some pretty intense criticism as to thier performance in Afghanistan and Iraq - I was particularly interested in getting some insight on that topic - none to be found.   There have been few quality books written on the conflict - mostly due to the covert nature of many of the units currently involved - but you cannot help but notice the sense of inter-service jockeying in the books that have come out. Roberts Ridge, and Down Range both paint glimmering portraits of the SEALS, while "Not a Good Day to Die" really skewers them. In my review of "Not a Good Day.." I point out that Naylor is a writer for the Army times; and mention that there may be some alterior motives for slamming the DEVGRU/SEAL performance in Anaconda, but after reading this and other books, I think his work is superior, and far less biased.  
 I wonder why so many people give it 5 stars as there is nothing spectacular in the book. First of all, the plot starts out well but quickly collasped into nonsense after the first chapter.  It is simply weird and unconvincing for Ramsey to write a whole book (over 200 pages) to the Headmaster as a response to a two-page articule. ( I wonder whether the Headmaster is going to read that lengthy thing!) There are too many trivial things and characters and unnecessary details (such as the mentioning of many unknown books and authors) that tend to annoy the reader.  Even worse was the religious content, which, you know, if you have read enough Voltaire and Kierkegaard and Nietszche you will find his religious analyses superficial. It is supposed to be a satire, but you will find Davie makes jokes that are not really funny.  ( I'd say Voltaire's Candide is ten times more successful as a satire than Fifth Business.) Overall, I find the book too long ( there are many sections that could be deleted and the flow of the story wouldn't be affected ) and simply boring, for unlike masters such as J. Conrad and R.L. Steveson, Robertson Davies failed to give his book an exciting and attractive plot.  Davies was over-praised. And if he regarded as the best Canadian author, it would be Canada's shame 
 The "Two New Sciences" are required study at Thomas Aquinas College in California. I and a number of students have this paperback edition. The pages come loose and just keep coming loose as you study the propositions.  Even being very careful with the book, the pages still keep coming out.  I have heard a number of other people complain of this same problem.    Pretty much everyone here knows that the paperback edition falls apart and they only buy it since it is cheaper than the hardback.  I have no idea how the pages hold up on the hardback edition, but I hear that it is better than with the paperback.  So unless you intend to put it in a display case and read it from there, I urge you to skip the paperback version and get the hardback or get another publishing entirely (if such exists) until Wall & Emerson gets their act together and republishes this book, fixing the problem.  I rate two stars only because of the greatness of the text itself, subtracting three for the horrible binding.  
 I had very high hopes for this book, but they were all dashed. The first two chapters Introdution and Architectural Styles were a good overview of Software Architecture in general and some of the major architectural styles  such as "pipe and filter" which is used in systems such as  Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 DTS.  Although it was great to read about the  different styles, they were treated trivially--not in-depth.  The rest of  the book has very basic case studies that may be good for a Software  Architecture 101 course in junior college--not Carnegie Mellon. I would  have loved to have found some more "real world" case studies with  UML (which this book does not address) 
 20 to 40 seconds of brilliance followed by a long and painful yearning. These are not songs, but rather multiple 20 second jingles joined together to serve the movie, but not the listener. You can't even call them a medley. Silvestri is amazing, but the soundtrack leaves you yearning for more. A twenty second blurb is not enough to be a whole song. Multiply this accross the entire cd and what you have is nothing worth listening to. 
 I am an avid reader and I love British "cozies".  That said, I could barely make myself finish this book.  The characters are not interesting, I got tired of hearing how "beautiful" the main character is and the mystery was uninspired.  
 I will first admit that I have not yet finished the book. And I will also admit that I am reading it because of The Da Vinci Code. Very intriguing tale. I must say that Dan Brown lays out the case far better than Ms. Picknett. I couldn't help but wonder, "When is she going to get to the point?" So when do we actually hear about Mary Magdalene? So far all I have read about is her obvious distaste for "The Church." As if the Roman Catholic church is the only church involved with the "shaky" Christian religion. And as if all Catholics or indeed all Christians are sanctimonious sexual predators. Well, dear, my faith has not been shaken, not in Jesus and not in my church. Even if Mary Magdalene was in fact Jesus's wife, concubine, illicit or blatant lover. And I do consider myself a student of science and well educated, as well as one who views the world with a skeptical eye as I will soon graduate from medical school. And still my faith isn't shaken. It's as if in this book she is trying to justify her dislike for the church by massive leaps of logic and an unholy obsession with Leonardo Da Vinci. So tell me, by the end of the book, will I find the point 
 The authors of Outsourcing America claim to explain the real world of Globalization, as opposed to the unduly optimistic proclamations of many economists. They focus on uneven distribution of gains from international trade, the costs of retraining displaced workers, persistent unemployment and lost income, and uncertainty regarding which parts of the economy will replace jobs lost to outsourcing. Hira and Hira think that Globalization is threatening America's future by allowing corporations to export high paying jobs, rather than revenue generating manufactures. They see global competition as a national, rather than an individual matter. Corporations focus on short run profits rather than long run national well-being. The Federal government must save America from the myopia of the market with a policy to protect important domestic industries.  Their contention that the effects of Globalization are uneven is correct, and already known to economists. Free trade benefits consumers through lower prices, as well as those workers and capitalists who edge out rivals in global markets. Obviously, those who come in second place lose income, but still benefit from lower prices as consumers.   The authors contend that Globalization benefits capital at the expense of labor. They also complain about businesses influence in politics. Narrow business interests do have inordinate influence in politics. However, the same thing is true of narrow labor interests. Smaller is better in politics. Relatively small groups, like business associations and labor unions, can organize to lobby the government more effectively than larger groups, like the general consuming public. Mancur Olson proved this in his book `The Rise and Decline of Nations'. The authors fail to realize that efforts to protect workers in select industries redistribute incomes between workers. President Bush's steel tariff benefited steel workers at the expense of autoworkers, construction workers, and all consumers. Both industry and labor have lobbied to avoid competition throughout history, and success in these efforts comes at the expense of the general consuming public. Yet Hira and Hira speak of special interest politics as an unfortunate turn of events that favors business interests. They think that government should oppose competition in labor markets, instead of supporting big business. What they overlook is that by supporting competition in general the general consuming public benefits at the expense of narrow business and labor interests. This is why mainstream economists support globalization.   Special interest bias is a general defect of government. Hira and Hira insist that government can promote the national interest, but this is a highly controversial notion . They also ignore the costs of politicizing commerce. The fact that government restrictions on global competition redistribute income means that interest groups will expend real resources to influence government policy. Competition over redistribution wastes a substantial part of many nations GDP.  Hira and Hira also misrepresent the economic case for Globalization. They claim that Economists have faith in free trade, and merely proclaim that all will be well in the long run. This is inaccurate. The authors avoid discussing the logic Comparative Advantage, and the body of empirical evidence supporting free trade and free markets, such as the work of Douglas Irwin and Peter Bauer. They claim to have written this book for the layperson rather that for the expert, so that all Americans can understand Globalization. Outsourcing America misinforms the layperson about what experts actually claim, while it promotes a nationalist agenda. The authors advance polemical untruths that fit in with their "pro-labor" politics.  Two simple facts undermine authors' case for fair trade.  Hira and Hira want Federal policies whereby America always reaps most of the immediate gains from Globalization. If America's trading partners also traded only when they gained most of the immediate gains from trade, then international commerce would collapse, and nobody would realize the immense benefits of Globalization. America will not always win the majority of the immediate gains from Globalization. It is utterly unrealistic to think that other nations will accept America claiming an automatic right to most of the immediate gains from trade.  With regards to long term issues, Hira and Hira correctly note that economists do not know what jobs will replace those lost to outsourcing. Politicians do not know this either. Actual competition in the real world reveals not only who gets the best jobs, it reveals which jobs are best. For their proposals to work politicians must not only ignore special interest influence in pursuit of national goals, they must also know which industries will deliver the highest paying jobs for Americans in the future. This is absurd.  Outsourcing America is the latest in a series of misleading books on Globalization. America will only be a second place winner sometimes, but this is better than a situation where all lose. We never know what the first place outcomes will be in advance anyway. These simple facts invalidate their case for "fair trade" policies 
 This should definitely be a made for TV movie as it was totally predictable! This couple submits an ad to become swingers to spice up their love life.  Later they decide they don't need these people anymore but they won't let down...I am sure you can figure out the rest from there, this movie was a total cliche 
 I'm a fan of Christina Ricci and dark comedies, yet I found this film damn near unwatchable. The only things intriguing about it are why the actors agreed to do it, why it was made, and why, after the backers presumably saw the finished product, it was released. The film itself gets no stars; my one star is for Ricci's presence.  For Ricci completists only, and then I recommend it be viewed with the sound off so that no one need listen to the dialogue 
 A friend of mine gave me Bad Love to read when I spent the night at his house and was looking for a book.  I started it, and took it home with me.  After almost finishing it, I called him and said I really didn't like it, at which point he started laughing and told me both he and his wife thought it was horrible, and they gave it to me as a gag!  They couldn't beleive I got as far as I did.  I like fiction, and even meaningless pop-fiction like Patterson, Stephen King, Grisham, etc., so I'm not some elitist.  With that as a background,  Bad Love is without a doubt the worst work I have ever read.  I am shocked that people have given this garbage 5 stars.  Its poorly written, has a bad plot, and....you know what....its not even worth going on.  I am only writing to warn others.  Avoid at all costs.  You would be better off shaving your head with a cheese grater than putting yourself through Bad Love.  
 I have loved this series since discovering them in the late 80's.  I think that O'Brian ranks with Austen, Twain, Forster, etc. regardless of 'genre'.  However, Simon Vance just does not do justice to this book.  I have not heard his renditions of others in this series, but if his Aubrey voice is consistent, they must all be disasters.  Aubrey sounds like one of Monty Python's Twits.  Vance also rushes descriptions that deserve much better pacing.  He also seems to miss much of the wit hidden in O'Brian's circumlocations -- or is much too subtle at conveying it.  I hate to diss working actors but....  Mr. Vance should try Wodehouse.  Bring back Tull 
 The Sierras are much nicer when visited in person. Reading about the natural wonders found there isn't the same as actually checking them out for yourself. Perhaps if you were already familiar with the areas Mr. Muir traversed, and wish to brush up un them or revisit them literarily when unable to do so physically... THEN perhaps this book would be better 
 This was a very bad book.  Save your money and if she comes back do not do the same things that caused her to leave in the first place.  Change yourself for the better and let her see those positive changes if you do reconcile.    If you did not treat her badly and she left you then you need to find someone who appreciates you and keep her out of your life because the problem is with her not you.  This is free advice that will work and save you from spending money on a worthless book like this 
 Warning, before reading this book make sure you are well schooled in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, US involvement with Somalia, the Persian Gulf War, and Islam. The more you know about these subjects the more you will realize that Bergen interjects his political opinions throughout the book with side comments; by selectively adding some facts and leaving out others; and by the clever arrangements of facts.  Bergen is biased against the US and eerily; the net affect is some sort of weird admiration for OBL.  Bergen falls for some of OBL's twisted, misrepresentation of the Koran. See page 99 and note the Bergen's equalization of the words infidel and idolater. He also defends OBL's rants against the US by clarifying for the reader that UN sanctions killed 500,000 Iraqi children. Of course Bergen leaves out Saddam Hussein's role in starving his own people.  Bergen's account of the murder of Abdullah Azzam (Bergen calls him OBL's mentor) follows right after discussion with former Pakistani Prime Minister so this arrangement implies that somehow they are connected. Other scholars suspect OBL of murdering Azzam. This Bergen ignores.  In his discussion of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan he spends all his time talking from the side of the rebels. He gives no background as to events leading up to it, nor the poor military practices in the Soviet army which contributed to its own defeat. The Soviet Union published an after action review, The Bear Went Over the Mountain, that points out individual combat leaders and mistakes they made that were grievous enough so that any band of rebels could have beaten them. Bergen only presents OBL view that he brought down a super power. He does mention the US made Stinger missile, but spends more time talking about how clumsy the US was to let some of these go unaccounted for; rather than mentioning that without the Stinger the Soviets would not have pulled out.  In Chapter 4, he mentions Desert Storm and out of left field adds the fact the Timothy McVeigh was one of the 500,000 US troops there. He adds that before 9-11 OK City was the worst terrorist activity in US. The subliminal message is US Army is an equivalent terrorist organization as Al-Qaeda. Later he outright says training in an Al-Qaeda camp is better that basic training in the Army.   In discussing Somalia, he makes sure the reader is aware George H Bush got US involved. He leaves out background information about the UN and Boutris Boutris Ghali role in tribal conflict. He claims at "least 500" Somalis died when more respected accounts put the number at 3000. He says US "tried" to capture and never mention they did capture two bad guys. In all he makes the US look foolish and A-Qaeda's cause of serious blow against US. He doesn't mention the decision by Les Aspin to hamper the mission by denying the US its own armor-protected vehicles.   While recounting OBL's case against the US (like the reader is suppose to take this seriously) he adds his opinion that for two thousand years Christians don't follow the teachings of Jesus.  I'm not half way through the book and I'm sorry I bought it.   I was hoping for a documented history about OBL. Instead I got the CNN view of the world - OBL is a deeply religious man, a great military leader, a successful businessman, and has a legitimate case against the US, which by default is guilty. 
 It's one of the more painful book I've came across.  Poorly edited,and poor accuracy. If I could get a refund, I shall be happy to.  New concept are added with no mention whatsoever, in the tutorial.  Additions to files are added with no mention to the files names.  From chapter 1 to 12 I've trudged, but I'd say this book needs a strong review.         
 I refuse to believe that any human being can actually believe the hateful, uninformed, and often bewildering things that Ann Coulter says in this book. So if you're thinking about buying "Godless" or any other of Ann's hate speech because you're a conservative and want to read more about conservative beliefs, keep looking. Turning to this drivel to learn more about true conservatism is like trying to become an attorney by watching a Judge Judy marathon. It's entertainment for the lowest common denominator. Ann Coulter sells books by being outrageous and spewing craziness so you'll be interested. She doesn't care about conservatives, and she doesn't share your beliefs - I don't care who you are. All she cares about is taking your money. Do us all a favor and stop padding this woman's pockets. 
 I owned this system for 9 months.  The single worst home electronics investment I've made in 30 years.  The DVD player choked on brand new DVD's constantly.  "Cannot Read Disc" or 5min+ pauses ruined more family movie nights than I can recall.  I couldn't get Bose customer support to respond to me.  Ever.  It's exapandability and connectivity are miniscule.  It was not even possible to buy a functioning DVD player to plug into it and salvage the investment.  The "surround sound" is a joke, but I never  realized it till I replaced it with a real 5.1 system.  Seriously - don't even think about it.  Friends don't let friends buy Bose.. 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 This is not a biography but rather a discussion of each of Hitchcock's films. For each film there is: - Detailed synopsis - Cast and Crew details - Analysis of the film  These first two of these items can be obtained from the Internet for free and who really wants to know the details of the story anyway? The analysis of each film is largely a waste of time as Spoto tends to over-analyse each film to the point of distraction while offering no real insights.  If you want to find out more about Hitchcock's films I would recommend McGilligan's excellent biography. This discusses each film in the context of Hitchcock's life and career and is far more illuminating 
 Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book.  I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either 
 For years I have avoided Jodi Picoult novels and if this one is typical, with good reason.  For my book club, I am plowing through the nauseating minuate that bulks this novel to over 400 pages.  The constant, brief shifts in first-person narration are too fast and give views on characters, such as a judge who likes show tunes, that are irrelevant to the novel at the expense of more fully developing the title character.  The first-person narration works for important characters but otherwise I think the author is using an easy narrative device to propel the action of her novel, which is, even with this technique, infuriatingly slow and has the effect of jarring the reader every page or two as one must determine the narrator yet again.    Also, the focus on the child-custody battle removes attention from who I think is the most interesting character--the child Faith.  If one can get past the didactic symbolism of the name Faith White, and the constant phrasing such as "here is a story about faith" (p. 275) followed by "he'll do whatever is in his power to make sure I keep Faith," (p.291), which makes me cringe at each repetition, the child seeing or hearing God is, to me, the most interesting aspect of the plot but one that receives little attention.    Overall, I think this novel is heavy-handed, overly descriptive and replete with such obvious symbolism and detail it makes my eyes hurt. The characters never seem real and I never sympathize with any of their easily predictable reactions and emotions, but find the potential of the plot is never fully realized in any engaging way. Try a different novel- many others dealing with religion exist that are far better written and much more interesting 
 I began reading Forever Amber last week (hoping to find a book I might like while I waited for another one to come available at the Library) and from the first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book.  But I am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it.  Upon finishing it I feel cheated.    The book isn't all that bad.  There is a lot of movement, intrigue and history in it.  But I couldn't feel for the characters.  The main character, Amber, was not someone that I would like and even when things went wrong for her, I still felt that way.  I assume that no one is supposed to like her.  And although I didn't like any of the characters in this book, I guess I did feel something for Amber because I felt like she should be with Lord Carlton...up in until the last part of the book.  Then I realized that she shouldn't be with anyone.    The reason for the two stars is because of the ending.  I hated that ending.  I felt totally cheated after reading the whole 700 plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly.  I agree with others who have left reviews here, it seems that the author decided that she either didn't want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about.    Anyway, it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book I have been waiting for becomes available but I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's really not worth the time.   I guess you either love the book or you hate it.  And I hated it. 
 Main Line, Main Line.... those Main Liners.... You like to look at those Main Liners, don't you Ginger... I mean Kitty?  You the suffragette who just got offa the suffragette wagon...  the same wagon that was seen rolling by in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle... wait a minute... that was the exact same footage!  I guess the makers of this fine movie assembled it out of stock footage.  In fact Wynn, the MAIN LINER seems to be assembled out of stock footage of Bill Clinton.  Did you know allabout the MAIIINNNE LIIIIINNNEEE????  Seems the whole worl knows about the MAIIIIIIINNNNEEE LIIIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEE "Philadelphia Aristocracy"  See, in Philadelphia, they're old skool, dig.  They even got a Queen of Pennsylvania, who sits on a throne and stuff.  Played by Margaret Dumont when she's not getting scandalized by Groucho Marx.  And I believe there is a duke and duchess of Bakersfield.  And just the other day I had tea and crumpets with the Viscount of Compton.  Of the Night Train...  I mean Wild I... I mean Yeah, he was drinking Ripple back when Redd Foxx was merely the Duke of Cornwall.  He was in line to the throne... or was that waiting for the mens room... See, over here in the States we take our aristocracy just as seriously as our Prussian counterparts.  We are always to be seen marching around with those spiky helmets on, saluting the statue of Kaiser Bill's moustache 
 If you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet, your unit will not be covered by the APS warranty on this device. Lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried. The cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with APS. They denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage (even though the modem wasn't hurt?) 
 This is a gadget with more promise than delivery. It was a retirement gift to me and I'm sure glad that not a penny from my pocket went toward the purchase. Difficult to operate and the end product is not worth the trouble. You have been warned 
 I bought this book after a friend recommended it to me.  I have to say that I'm sorry that I did.  The book advises first time parents that at least one parent should stay home full time.  For a second it actually made me to start to feel guilty for wanting to work outside the home....for only a second though.  It also goes on to say that the family should sacrafice and live on one income.  I personally feel that my husband and I are setting a good example for our children since both of us are working and contributing equally to the household.  After reading Lehman's opinion on this, I decided there was no need to continue reading.....don't waste your money on this one 
 But had one of the  worst endings ever...what happened anyway? My husband and I had to rewind the movie 3xs and still could not decide if the two people on board were alive or ghosts?  For example, the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn't see the woman, who was clearly standing up looking around.  And her baby was crying miserably...the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet, she wasn't interested at all in comforting the child, instead, she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved, which didn't make any sort of sense?  These types of questions CHEAT the viewers, because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end...its like ordering a piece of cake, and not being allowed to eat it...which sucks!  Ohh, by the way, four out of the six actors should find new careers 
 This book is written by an annoying, weak man.  The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors.  This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating.  I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying.  Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere.  There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 These guys have to be the blueprint for all the hilarious cheesy songs the Southpark guys use on their TV show and in "Team America".  You can't find much rock n' roll music that is weaker than Nightranger.  And to think this is the greatest hits!  Horrible, horrible music.   Back in the 80's when everyone was listening to this instead of the Replacements it was laughable.  20 years later it's even more laughable and shocking.  The ONLY way anyone could enjoy this would be listening in a nostalgiac sense.  If you were 12 in 1985 
 Mr. Shore's book couldn't possibly be more pretensious, or more out of touch with the fundamental changes that are taking place in the world of photography.  His writing is wordy, his perspective self-promotional, and  his ideas are trapped in the critical perspective of a mid 1970's college  professor.  If you're interested in a book that explores photography in the  pre-digital era, you'd be better off spending your money on John Berger's  "Ways of Seeing", or Sontag's "On Photography" 
 My 3 1/2 year old daughter is a huge Munch fan and likes this one well enough, but it's my least favourite.  She tends to memorize books and quote them constantly, and I'm not thrilled with the "hey, you dumb...." mantra.  This is kind of minor, but how was it that the pigs showed up at school after Megan locked them back in at home? If you're wanting to add to your Munch collection, he's written better.  Alligator Baby and Thomas's Snowsuit are fun without the insults and a little more logically consistent 
 Why are they butchering Pac's songs like this. I advise anyone to get the bootlegs over this album. The original Ghetto Gospel and Loyal To The Game are 2 of my favorite Pac songs but the one's on here are painful to listen to. Afeni should have let DJ Quik, Daz, and whoever else that worked with Pac do this album. They should have just digitally remastered the bootlegs. This started with Still I Rise to Until The End Of Time to Better Dayz and the quality has been going down and down and they hit rock bottom with this one. The 2 stars is 1 because it is Pac and another for the song Uppercut. The most obvious butcher job is Black Cotton where Em chose a fast beat and you could tell he is trying to speed up Pac's rhyme. I hope they do better with this last album due out this year 
 Hmmm, don't eat anything with a face?  The arrogance in that is astounding...so the way it works is, we gotta face, so since we're above EVERYTHING, anything that looks kinda like us must be worthy of life.  Geeez.  Aren't there beautiful ocean creatures that don't have a face...okay to eat them?  I've noticed how plants will move toward the sun...I guess that's just a quirk, guess it doesn't really mean they have consciousness or have a strong desire to live...  I s'pose whatever higher being planned all this was kinda off the mark 'cause he/she made the boo-boo of having animals eat animals.  That couldn't possibly be "right."  Um, yeah...    Native Americans knew...ALL life is sacred.  They thanked those animal beings whose lives were sacrificed for their nourishment, for their survival.  They respected ALL life.  We are not above animals, we are part of the animal kingdom.  We are part of this PERFECT system called Nature.  It is twisted thinking like "eat nothing with a face" that reeks of a sense of superiority (and judgment) that is most unwarranted.  It isn't about not eating them, it's about respecting them, eating them (or not) as we personally intuit for our own health in a healthy way (not all day, everyday...) Not locking them in cages where they can't move, not torturing them in labs, not reveling in the "sport" of killing them, not poisoning them with drugs to make them fatter or whatever...allow them to live in peace and when we must take them for our nourishment, do it in a humane way...animals die, people die...such is the nature of this existence.  Death is but a doorway for all life, and it's essential for the continuation of life on this planet.  Believe it or not, I've been both vegetarian and vegan, because I adore animals.  But I could not have been more unhealthy on those types of diets, and I find it sad that the majority of vegetarians I've come across rarely look robust and healthy.  They are generally pale and thin, even Linda McCartney died of breast cancer.  I'm not saying it's because she didn't eat meat, but her diet certainly didn't save her from that vicious disease.  Vegetarianism is definitely not for everyone, and my guess is that if it's healthy for anyone, they are in the minority 
 In a nutshell, the ludicrous scenarios and insinuations in this book are so stupid and insulting to ANYONE's intelligence that I'm surprised it got published at all. A lawyer wrote this garbage, huh? I wonder where he graduated from. Perhaps he obtained his 'degree' from the same place Scott Peterson got the 3 fake ones hanging on HIS wall? Unbelievable! Did this 'author', and I use this term loosely, EVER do any real research on this case?  This Dalton character who wrote this book obviously just needed a money fix. Must be a mediocre-at-best attorney to have to stoop to this level of ethical malfeasance. A total lack of integrity on his part is an issue as well.  For those who care about Laci Peterson and the TRUTH of her murder read Sharon Rocha's book, "For Laci" as well as Catherine Crier's Book, "A Deadly Game". Also, do some research on the investigation itself-a lot of information is in the public domain. If I could find information on this case myself, a lowly civilian, then surely Dalton could have. I just don't think he wanted to, frankly. I believe I could write a better and more accurate book all on my lonesome!  Skip this book unless you truly don't think Scott Peterson killed his wife and son.  
 I tried this once. You can get the same thing by buying some popping corn in your local grocery, popping it, pouring it into a bowl, and adding milk. This made me reluctant to try other Kashi products.  Frankly, I don't see why people continue to pay an outrageous price for what amounts to popcorn.  PS. Amazon should add a zero star rating 
 We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day!   Like I said before, other than this, it has been great.  
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 I had never read the Scarlet Pimpernel, nor seen any of the films. One day when I didn't have time to finish a chapter, I thought I'd start the Introduction. I was enjoying the mystery-style nature of the story, then, in the first three sentences of the introduction they tell you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is! I have quit reading the book because of this. I plan to start again, in hopes that their spoiler was not far off anyway, but it was a terrible let down - on par with when my sister gave away they end of "The Sixth Sense" - which I could not enjoy, knowing what the big secret was. If you get this edition - or any edition, just in case - don't read the introduction 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 i got charged for this and havent gotten it. what bulls** 
 Horowitz once filled-in for the boring and deceptive radio host Dennis Prager, and I took the opportunity to call Horowitz and share a Thomas Jefferson quote that went, "I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country."  David seemed very confused about the issue of corporatism, a topic that many on the left (and the right) are thinking about (see the brilliant DVD "The Corporation" which features interviews with Milton Friedman & Noam Chomsky).  Anyway, it appears Bechtel, Raytheon, Exxon, KBR and other war profiteers are well-served by the perception management efforts of Horowitz.  He has quite a few people believing, or wanting to believe, that the people we're oppressing (who are vitually defenseless against our $450 billion per annum WMD machine) are actually the "evildoers."  Yet, it's our elites (and that segment of the population that makes a living off of our economy of death, plus all of us through our tax dollars) who are the ones that are weaponizing space, organizing terrorist training camps like "The School of the Americas," conducting a Constitutionally appalling "War on (some) Drugs," and dispatching an army of propagandists, soldiers of fortune, and economic hit men that create misery throughout the world.  It's amazing our victims haven't tried to attack us more than they have.  Vietnamese, Colombians, Angolans, Guatemalans, East Timorese and many others certainly could make arguments for a need to attack us pre-emptively or for avenging past aggressions.  They're more civilized than us, the so-called "Christians" who actually worship Satan and all the bigotry and violence he cultivates in the world.  For people with the emotional/psychological strength to face reality, I'd recommend "The Sorrows of Empire," by Korean war veteran Chalmers Johnson.  He's another true conservative who sees the same problem that "leftists" like President George Washington warned of when he said, "Overgrown military establishments are under any form of government iauspicious to liberty, and are to be regarded as particularly hostile to Republican liberty." - Farewell address, September 17, 179 
      I hated this book even when I was a kid. Lucy Maud Montgomery didn't know how to "create" a happy marriage between Anne and Gilbert because her own marriage was so disasterous. In real life, Lucy Maud's only friends were women and her negative attitude towards her husband is reflected in this book. Gilbert should have been outgoing, interesting, debonaire and REAL. Instead, he's a flat cardboard character who hides in the background. Although Anne is only in her late 30's, she's a prim and repressed matron who feels life has passed her by as she watches her children grow. And the kids are annoying! Saintly Walter is being primed as the sacrificial lamb and martyr--a destiny he fulfills in "Rilla of Ingleside." There's something weirdly disturbing and unreal about them...and their parents. Believe it or not--the most fascinating character is "Christine," the sultry widow who flirts with Gilbert and tries to "steal" him away from Anne--sort of! Christine is a little naughty and not very nice (by early 1900's standards) and she spices up this otherwise dull book.  
 This book was an assigned text for a seminary class, which is the only reason that I read it.  I have a degree in secondary education, so I spent considerable time during college studying these types of concepts, though the terminology in this book was new to me.  I began this book with a chip on my shoulder about the psychobabble that seems to dominate many discussions about pedagogy, and she certainly reinforced several of those irritations.  For instance, she spent considerable time describing the futility of lecture.  I realize that lecture has significant limitations, but I think it is a silly overgeneralization to disregard its potential entirely.    Beyond this ideological dispute, my primary complaint about the book is that it is dreadfully dry.  Vella is long on theory and short on inspiration.  She may have some good things to say about teaching, but if the experience of teaching is anything like this book, who would want to do it!!  Having said these things, she was able to redeem herself on several levels.  She provides some great tips for allowing learners to actually learn.  Some of that information is summarized in several helpful charts.  Her explanation of time management was particularly insightful.  Specifically, I am compelled to make sure that I stop trying to fit too much "What" (content) into the allotted "When" (time slot).  There is clearly some good stuff in this book; it is just a shame that it is so boring to find those nuggets of wisdom!!  By the way, how can a 130-page book cost $34?  That is a crime.  For that reason alone, I wouldn't recommend this book.  
 This is definately not the 60's compilation CD to get. Who was in charge of choosing the songs on this boring album anyway? I bought it for Van Morrisson, and was not familiar with any of the other songs but one. They weren't good 
 This book stinks, the plot is trivial, the characters suck, and the chapters go on and on and on and on and on about nothing, nothing at all.   Here is my favorite passage from the book "There was nothing for him to do but roll over and try to sleep.  Somewhere, sometime, he had even forgotten how to cry."  Yeah the entire book is like that.   
 I agree with most of the reviews here. I also grew up with watching the re-runs on Sunday mornings as a kid, and so when we introduced a VHS rented tape to my daughters they loved them. The "talkies" are the only films I'd consider buying and I think most people would only want as well. There was 1 DVD missing (we had two #5 DVD's)and missing the Spanky gang #4 disk. Right now we only have 1 original "talkie" and the rest documentaries and silent movies. I believe the company who produces this DVD set should be ashamed of themselves. They plaster Spanky's images all over all the videos and then we don't even have one of him!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO (unless you like silent movies and bad documentaries) with film qualities that were bad copies (that are hard on the eyes!!!!  We're taking this one back and damanding a refund!! 
   I'm calling on all decent, patriotic Americans to boycott Newman's book.  I've had him for two US history courses and all he does is spout anti-american sentiments and convince students to hate America.  He would rather we'd never fought the revolutionary war because he believes the rich started the war and used the poor to get richer, never mind that Washington turned down kingship.  Do yourself a favor and don't listen to anything Newman has to say.  Don't waste your money buying a book from a man whose sole purpose is to spread anti-american propoganda to impressionable college students.      I swear, some of what he says about present-day America could come straight from an al-Qaida training video.  So steer clear of this literature terrorist 
      This novel could have been a long short story or a novella. One event takes place in the story and Perez-Reverte milks it for all he can. There are plenty of  historical  persons such as poets, playwrights, and painters thrown it. This is basically a one episode tale. I rate this a B-. 
 Having seen the exhibit behind the book, I looked forward to reviewing the many gorgeous paintings I saw.  Although the text in the book is fine, the pictures are alas not.  Many are in black and white, but the real  disappointment came in the color reproductions where things were really  second rate, looking more suitable for postcards than a fine art book.  I  returned my copy to Amazon, and I would suggest you save your money unless  there is no other way you will see some of his work.  Very disappointing 
 This movie is an utter crap fest! I remember watching this film as a kid. Back then it was a scarry experience, watching it now is just plain mind numbing. This movie is beyond bad, and while some campy films can be quite entertaining, this is definitelly not one of those movies. Horrible acting, laughable demon makeups, zero excitement for horror fans. Don't waste your money on this crap, rent it before you consider buying it. 
 Hi this looks like a sweet deal i was wondering wat type of m16 magazine will work with this airsoft gun thx to the person who answers 
 The cover states that there are forwards written by Dick Brannan, Arnie Beswick and Hayden Proffitt. My copy contained no forwards of any kind. Actual facts and research are words that can only be used loosely to describe this book. Most of it reads like a compilation of material pulled together from previously published sources, and written poorly. I was anticipating this book, but once I knew who the authors were (read some reviews on their other titles), my expectations were lowered accordingly. I am a factory lightweight fan, but can't recommend this book for even a novice who is interested them. Wait until it's in a bargain bin if you have to have it 
 I couldn't get through my first Dresden novel. I made it about 120 pages and realized it wasn't worth continuing. How anyone can enjoy reading about this buffoon is beyond me. The humor is on the level of the Police Academy movies (and not the first one, the only good one) and the plot unfolds at a snail's pace. Butcher should be forced to read Raymond Carver so he can learn how a detective novel should be written. I gave the novel an extra star because the idea of porno vampires is titillating. Too bad Butcher couldn't match the quality of his prose with originality of the premise.  
 I bought this book based on reader reviews, and I can't believe how dissappointed I was!  The story itself was interesting enough, but the writing just didn't pull at my emotions at all.  Perhaps it made a better TV movie, but the read was nothing special.  I don't even think it was the fact that it was released in 1968 because after all, a classic transcends time.  This book is far from classic.  I can only guess that those who love it have maintained a smaller spectrum as basis for comparison.  I however will continue my quest to find the perfect novel that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up!  
    This book was one of the textbooks for an honors leadership course I took in college. I absolutely hated it. The concepts were interesting but the language was too hard to follow. I felt inferior as I was reading this book, which is not aomething an author should strive to achieve.     Although, as I stated above, the author had interesting ideas and concepts, there was one thing that I had a tough time swallowing. The author argues that there is no such thing as a "bad leader". Instead, if you are not a good leader, you are not a leader. I strongly disagree with this idea, as an individual can be a leader but not a good one. I'm sure that most people can think of someone in their life that they would categorize as a "bad leader".     I will never recommend this book, nor will I ever purchase or read another book written by this author. 
 I had eagerly anticipated Amy's followup to the wonderful "Diary Of A Mod Housewife", but this is bitterly disappointing.  On that first record, she balanced bohemianism and single motherhood with humor and  passion.  This time out, it comes across as whining.  Hey, Amy, we're all  getting older, and guess what?  It's not so bad. Get over it! Even more  disturbing, the stylistic wandering of the music suggests that she doesn't  have the confidence in the songs to put them across without some production  crutch.  I liked the simple production style of "Diary" because  it let her heartfelt songs speak for themselves.  Get a new producer, Amy,  and please try to find something new to say for the next one 
 I am disappointed with this book. It contains just a bunch of articles about different chess topics, illustrated (mainly) with the author games. The articles are rather interesting and well written, games well annotated but ... it is hard to find the idea behind the book as a whole.  
 I would like to go to the trouble of explaining why, in detail, this is not a good movie; however, since amazon habitually goes to the trouble of deleting my other one star reviews, I will go to no such trouble 
 She wastes the first chapters, and my time, going to extremes with kooky consultants that only someone who doesn't deserve to be hired would use.  It adds to the drama and despair I suppose, but it comes off as contrived, and as an attempt to pander to her extremist/pessimist reading coterie. I don't think Babs could have possibly put more words in quotations.  Her OCD with quotated words and terms is a distraction that ultimately drove me nuts. I can't believe she's an accomplished writer. Her writing style can best be described as unsmooth and read-stoppage inducing. Oh well, her intentions were good 
 Okay this site is cool and all but why did this review get deleted? Just because I said cr a p doesn't mean I'm going to offend somebody!   Okay I'm going to keep this short. The worst band on this planet released their debut in 1997 and it sucks as s just as much as their other albums. Enough said.. 
 This was the worst book I have ever read.  The single most devastating experience in Barbara Johnson's life seems to be that her son was gay.  Not that two other sons were killed tragically, but that one of her two remaining children was involved in "the homosexual lifestyle."  Despite having only two surviving children, Johnson refuses to associate with her son unless they can completely ignore that he is gay.  After he leaves home (who could blame him) she says, "Whatever Lord" and continues on her merry way.  The fact that there is never any mention of what her son must have been going through all this time when he has been rejected by the one person in the world who should love him unconditionally is only one of the reasons this book is so upsetting.  Johnson writes about rejecting her son in such a flippant manner it is impossible to have any sympathy for her at all.   To her credit, she does finally write a few pages about loving your kids no matter what, but her "no matter what" seems to only mean once they come around to your way of thinking.   There are a lot of better sources for people coping with the lifestyle choices of a child than this book, which would have you brush your "flawed" child away like a gnat 
 A very poorly written, and ill reasoned book.  Very biased against Israel.  I would not recommend it at all 
 Phantom of the Opera has been a huge part of my life over the years, I heard and saw many casts of the show, I bought the books, I watched the movies, you get my point. This recording does not however represent how the show actually sounds live or what this cast was capable of in London and on Bway. Since, I think, this was recorded before the show even premiered that explains the bloodless quality of the recording. It's pretty, yes, but I'm never gripped as I was by this cast when hearing & seeing live material. Crawford sounds whiny and way too fake for me here and Brightman's musgy diction and sloppy singing is a disgrace. Steve Barton is a wonderful Raoul but even he got dragged down by the sterility of this recording. I do NOT hate this cast, in my opinion the OLC and OBC are amazing but exactly WHY the show reduced me to tears is not captured on this recording. Compared to that I much prefer the OCR (Canadian cast), OSC (Swedish cast) and the film cast. None of which offers the sterile beauty of this recording but they are all pulsing with passion and gripping drama 
 I read the first two chapters, scanned the rest, and decided not to waste any more time; there are too many good books to read. The premise of the writer (de Becker) is that intuition is correct where rational thought fails. He tells the stories of the lady who was attacked in a dark parking lot, the lady whose boy died during an operation, and the one whose son was getting a lot of attention from a pervert. In every case the lady had reason to fear for her or her boy's safety before a bad thing happened. To de Becker, each tale is proof that intuition was right and reason went wrong. The author does not cite his sources, but makes it clear that he is the world's foremost consultant, and gets these stories from people who attend his lectures and TV appearances (on Oprah!). The book might be better if it was all stories, but it is padded out to 321 pages with a lot of hot air. It never happens that anyone is taken by surprise, or has an unfounded suspicion. Becker gives us a slanted, unbalanced view, in trying to ratify the bold claims on the book jacket (how to know if every person your child will ever meet is a threat). The evidence is cooked. The thesis must be rejected. I offer the alternate hypothesis that de Becker pads his pockets selling bogus books to gullible parents. 
 Don't be fooled, this book is not rational, mystic, nor will it do anything to enlighten the reader.  The title of this book is as decieving as it possibly could be and if you are interested in any of the things mentioned (science, spirituality, myscicism, rationailsm, or enlightenment) this is NOT the book for you 
 I bought this book because I love Robert Munsch's book I Love You Forever. I knew what I was ordering so it's my own fault, but I can't use this book. It's stuck up in my closet and I've never given it to the kids. I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old boy, and I have enough trouble with them talking about things that I'd rather they didn't, so I don't know why I ordered this book. I know they'd think it was funny, but the last thing I really want to do is get them talking about farts all day. I'm sorry, if your kids are more mature I'm sure it would be fine for them. But it definitly wasn't for my family 
 My 4-year-old son LOVED The Berenstain Bears' New Baby and it was a big help in preparing for the arrival of his baby sister.  So when we were struggling with remembering manners, I bought this book, certain that it would help.  However, I ended up disagreeing with the approach to correcting bad or forgotten manners and rude behavior.  This book outlined specific chores as punishments for various offenses. As parents, we have learned that allowing children to help around the house with things like sweeping, taking out the garbage, and helping Mommy empty the dishwasher (the plastic stuff!) is very empowering and makes kids feel like they can contribute to the household and they enjoy being part of the "family team" (hopefully this will continue into their teens since we've started them as toddlers!).   Also, I learned that I should probably read through any new book by myself at least once before sitting down to read it to my children (parents can learn too!).  Just a thought 
 The images and text will make for nightmares. Not a fun one like "Where the wild things are." He is talented, just missed the mark on this one 
 COME was released during a rough time in Prince's career, possibly the height of his quarrels with Warner Bros. (his long-time label). Listening to this, you get the feeling that Prince may have released it as a 'f*** you' to the WB. He really was writing and recording great material at the time, and performing great concerts, but you wouldn't know it from listening to COME.  Regardless, there's one epochal cut here, "Loose!" A thunderous stomp that's one part hard-funk, one part industrial, I've heard some compare it to a Nine Inch Nails production, but it's totally Prince. As much as I hate this album, I always come back to "Loose!" You can probably purchase it through online vendors like iTunes for roughly a dollar, otherwise, get one of the cheap, used copies here (as of this writing there are a few well under $2 before shipping).  Hopefully WB or Prince will make "Loose!" available on a compilation, rendering COME obsolete, but until that happens, the disc is worth listening for that one track alone 
 I ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before.But the picture on the site and the product review looked good.When i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped.The pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished.I returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet.Its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time 
 This movie takes the cool concepts of Mimic, and then abuses, burns and trashes all the scary moments the first movie brought us.  This movie is slightly worse than watching an ant hill in the summer.  if that is your idea of fun - then enjoy 
 A Case for Amillennialism: Understanding the End Times  by Kim Riddlebarger is the best book going on End Times.  Escape the craziness for good, and buy this book.  Hopefully, you'll get that "Finally it all makes sense" understanding of what the scriptures tell of the End Times 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 (i am not a native speaker, please overlook my style) i am not going to review the novel, i simply love it. this edition was quite a disappointment to me: the box and the over book-cover are lovely, the pictures are exquisite; the book cover and the binding are rather of a poor quality but still better than the paper used and the printing which are untolerable for an edition as expensive as this 
 This book is about a girl.  She is 13.  She is going to America  She likes a boy named Lou.  she learns to sew.  she is pretty.  She has a grandmother. she is nice. she is cool 
 Pistolero and Nitrogen are cool but in no way should THESE tracks make an album what its worth.  Nitrogen sounds like something from Transmissions and Pistolero is just its own sound - very original and creative.  However the rest of the album is boring.  Juno Reactor is boring?!  What tha...  I wish I could disagree with myself but I can't disagree when I hear the songs again and again.  Every other JR album (before Shango) only had 1 or 2 that took time to grow on you as the rest of the songs were solid and just true musical talent.  This one only has 1 or 2 that are even decent.  That is not a good thing.  I remember waiting eagerly for this album to come out as it kept getting pushed back.  Pistolero came on and I thought this was going to be the best JR ever.  Then, sadly, the rest of it pretty much just dies.  A slow and disappointing death.  2 stars for 2 good songs.  That's it.  :(  I suggest to not even get this, but instead get the Pistolero single as it is about all this album has to offer.  Maybe you'll like it more than I did.  After "Beyond the Infinite" and "Bible of Dreams", JR put itself in higher and higher expectations, that is why I couldn't adapt to this 
 A good book, but not the best 
 I just purchased the 2 disc, special edition of this movie, and here's my problem(s):  First off, I don't speak Italian, so my only options are to watch the film with the English dub, or with the Italian dub with the English subtitles, but here's the problem; the English dub is out of sync with the film, sometimes being only slightly so, but other times being very noticeable and distracting (i.e. during loud sound effects, such as a chair being knocked over, or someone knocking loudly on a door).  And so my other option is the Italian bud with the English subs, but here's the problem with this, the English subs are missing during the scene where Peggy is reading the diary (about 30+ minutes into the movie).  Now, I had noticed missing subs during the first part of the film, but these where usually during background conversations, or occasionally a line would be missing from someone's speech, but could usually be figured out, and these where only slightly annoying, but the missing subs for the diary entry is inexcusable (and is also missing from the other subs as well) as this is an important bit of info to the plot of the story.  Also, when you set up the audio option, from the main menu, there's no problem, but I found that if you use the audio button on your DVD remote, the Italian option gives you the French soundtrack and the French gives you the Italian one. It's nothing serious, but it's an annoyance all the same.  So, does anyone else notice these problems, or did I just end up with a bum disc 
 Despite the some edition problems and the presence of lagoons in the script, the story retains its interest. A disturbed woman in his early twenties, who has suffered sexual abuse of his own father and maltreats of his husband finds casually, a man in the middle of the road who eventually will help to dig in her life and face her demons.          
 Stross writes with confidence and in fine style, but I was still left feeling empty. The problem with writing about technological singularity is that it's like trying to describe the Internet to an  ant. Too far outside the frame of reference of even the author.  I enjoy novels where I feel something for the characters, whether it be affection, love or even loathing. These characters left me indifferent.  Having said all that, Stross has an eye for irony that gave me a few chuckles 
 This is a slightly re-worked version of Mr. Baldwin's book of the same title published shortly after he won the wold series of poker main event in '78.  The forward indicates there was a big demand for an updated reprint, although I wonder why (see below).  The book consists of a memoir of Bobby's gambling and playing days, starting as a schoolboy and working through winning the main event.  At key points in the story, when he encounters a new poker game for the first time or runs into a common gambling problem, it waxes pedantic and gives the reader advice on that particular game or issue.  The problem with this book, and the reason I give it such a poor rating, is that it's not really any good as a memoir or poker manual.  It flops on both fronts.  The memoir side isn't particularly interesting.  Instead of recounting gambling tales that would be interesting to the reader (as Doyle does in his excellent Wisdom of a Poker Champion), it covers events from his personal life that were important to him (ie. wooing his various girlfriends) but that are just plain boring for the reader. This pattern is repeated throughout the memoir with one exception: the tale of how a group of kidnappers/killers almost ended his life (and did kill several others) over a gambling fortune they thought Baldwin had was engrossing.  But most of the rest is banal - him driving somewhere and almost running out of gas, stuff like that.  Unfortunately, the writing is not particularly good, so getting through the slow parts is even more of a chore.  As a poker manual, the book is likewise poor.  It gives about 2 pages of very general information about each of the poker games popular at the time, many of which aren't commonly played today.  The advice is OK as far as it goes, but isn't detailed enough to comfortably sit in even the lowest limit versions of those games.  In that sense it is far inferior to what you could learn by reading the Supersystem chapters on the same games (all of which appear in the original Supersystem, not Supersystem II).  This book probably once filled a niche for a low cost, low-content book covering a range of games, back when Supersystem cost $100 (in 1980's money).  But now Supersystem costs a fraction of that, the standards for poker instruction manuals have risen 100-fold, and this book is at the back of the pack.  There is one section of this book that I do feel is worth your time:  Bobby goes into some depth on the perils of extending credit to your gambling opponents, and provides some good advice how to make sure you get paid if/when you do.  Everything he says on the topic is spot-on, and I think that one section may be worth the price of the book for some readers.  If you've got a lending-related leak, then I would say this is a 5-star book for you since one bad loan prevented would easily pay the cover price.  Unfortunately, one good section doens't make for a good book.  In retrospect I wish I had spent my money on something else and that I could get a "refund" for the time spend reading the 90% that was neither interesting nor informative 
 Anyone older than that will be put off by this simplistic bit of fluff.  The author has pieced together quotes and statistics from other sources and throws them around liberally. It has the feel of a high school writing project. The advice she gives reads like something out of an article in "Seventeen Magazine".  For example, here are some of her tips for cultivating friends, Italian style:   1)Spend the time it takes to cultivate new friends. 2)Go beyond the superficial to create intimacy. 3)Practice giving and receiving affection. 4)Be willing to listen. 5)Show loyalty in your words and actions.  I bet you never would have thought of those things on your own, right?   Well, pay the $15.00 for this book and you can read 205 more pages full of equally valuable "Italian" advice.  Buy it for a teen, or better yet, save your money 
 "Possessed" is an unconvincing portrayal of an exorcism that apparently occurred some years ago and was the basis for the classic and seminal demonic possession movie known as "The Exorcist".  The acting is very poor in this movie and the movie fails to deliver the goods.    The movie, "Possessed", lacks the substance, style and atmosphere necessary to make any kind of horror movie effective, especially one about possession.  The action in this movie comes off as artificial and lacking the essence of the horror associated with demonic possession.  By contrast, "The Exorcist" thrusts the viewer into the world of demonic possession and, as a result, the viewer becomes emersed in the story and can actually feel the horror and pain associated with this subject matter.  "Possessed" tackles a very difficult issue and does a very poor job of portraying demonic possession and exorcism.    In short, "Possessed" is lifeless and has no spirit which is necessary to present the horrors and trappings of demonic possession and exorcisms.  For good movies on demonic possession, I recommend "The Exorcist", "The Exorcist III", "Amityville II: The Possession" and "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", especially "The Exorcist" based on the novel by William Peter Blatty 
 2 1/2 stars  Despite this album's horrible vocals and carnie-on-acid vibe, there are actually many times throughout the disc that you hear an amazing young band with some real fire in their approach. This album does work better as a sheer party favor for your head then an actual musical exploration, be sure that you want to embrace your inner 15 year old partying teen mode complete with crappy garage band rehearsal vibe, and you will appreciate this alot more  
 No free lunch & you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?  Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product.. 
 Please read David Maces's review. I bought mine about two years ago and just today the plastic part mentioned by Mr. Mace failed. A sturdy, sleek can opener is now going to the trash permaturely because Hamilton Beach does not provide a replacement part 
 The book is very informative, entertaining, and instructive. It gives the benefits and drawbacks of each type of life insurance. It's a good reference book. It's easy to read and understand.  However, it is very biased towards variable universal life (VUL). In fact, the author states that this type of policy is the reason why the book exists. He even goes so far as to say that VUL is one of the best investment vehicles of the century! He's a good cheerleader for VUL and even though he is honest and does point out the pitfalls of VUL, he sort of skims over the probability of problems with these policies in later years.  This book inspired me to check VUL policies and get some illustrations. I was shocked at the high probability of lapse in these policies if the expected return in the investments was average, say expected 8% return. You really need to get over 10% annualized return in the policies to be assured that the policy will not lapse. Anything less than that and you are running a grave risk of having to fund the policy dramatically or see it lapse just at a time when you need it most, after age 70. The trick is to adequately fund the policy from the start, and the funding can be quite expensive. And even after all of that, the insurance company makes YOU assume the risk of generating enough return to keep the policy in force. Even if you don't take any loans, the policy can lapse if the returns are just a little bit less than expected. That's very high risk to me. There are no affordable guarantees of minimum death benefit or cash values in a VUL, regardless of loans or premiums paid on time. I was shocked to learn this in reality.  So don't fall for the hype in this book about VUL. The author greatly under-estimates the risk inherent in VUL policies.   Ultimately, I'd say there are better books on insurance if you just want to learn about the basics.  
 This product is ineffective.   The snorkel gets stuck, either open so that water pours in while you're trying to breathe, or stuck shut so you cannot take a breath of air while under water. It's is very distressing when you're out in deep water snorkelling and the breathing tube fails to perform! I often take in mouthfuls of water, or worse; suck for a breath of air and get nothing! It is therefore useless, I stopped using the tube as it is more trouble than good.  I bought two sets, one for my partner and one for myself, and they both fail to perform. The mask on one set broke after 2 months (the metal pin became dislodged) and the tightening clips on the flippers frequently fall off while trying to tighten them to your feet. The bag's zippers rusted not long after use... given that most people snorkel in salt water, you think they would have considered rust proofing the metal.   Overall the quality of these not-so-cheap kits are embarrassingly bad. We both felt awkward snorkeling with them, and sometimes I even felt they were hazardous.   We tossed these products and bought Cressi brand gear. It has changed our underwater experience 
 This tiny item ships for $2 more than it costs. I'll purchase it elsewhere 
 What else is there to say?  The acting is mediocre, the story line is nearly non-existent, and the only redeeming thing this film has to offer is the somewhat interesting cartoons superimposed upon the original score.  The vast disconnect between the book and the movie is at its most evident when the film ends, concluding with a quote from Phillip K. Dick that has virtually nothing to do with what you've just seen and makes you wish that it (the film) did 
 I'm a Roald Dahl fan but this book doesn't come close to being as good as his other stories.  It reads like a rough draft of an idea he had that was never fully developed into a finished story.  I'm amazed Disney decided to have it published.  The characters are flat.  You never really like or dislike the gremlins, even though they are supposedly an enemy of the airforce, but later become friends.  And Gus, and airforce pilot, is stupid and dull.  Dahl has other stupid and dull characters in other stories but they are usually the villans and are presented with delicious, twisty Dahl humor.  In The Gremlins, Gus is supposed to be a hero.  The biggest disappointment was the lack of Dahl's signature humor.  The story lacks so much of what you normally expect in a Dahl tale I kept asking myself with disbelief, "this is a Roald Dahl story?"   
 Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book. 
 Have tried about six times to install it.  I've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice, all to no avail.  It says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings.  It tells you to check the log.  Well, there are over 85k entries and even if I found the errors I don't see any way to correct the errors. When I try to run it I get "starter MFC Application has encountered a problem and needs to close".  I'll be returning this puppy to Amazon for a replacement 
 while this might be a great read, the humor and timing does not translate to audio.  It comes off as a boring narrative 
 What a lousy writer. If he didn't complain about everything and then get drunk and call himself a poet, we'd all call him an annoying, whiny drunk 
 The film was great, but the music, which seemed to fit the film so nicely, just doesn't hold up well on the CD. Save your money for  the DVD or something more interesting than this overly emotional East-West hogwash 
 Big fan of Nas, but this moive's a bit over the top and have some good messages that suffer because of it. Visually flashy, vacant plot, and messages are reduced to sermonizing. Skip this and watch Juice instead 
 Hansen is a reporter who makes a guy boading a plane with orchids hidden inside his clothes sound like a nice man, while making environmental agencies sound evil. He spends many pages letting likely criminals tell their stories, while providing only a brief and biased view of the people trying to stop them. It's an entertaining story, but it's false. Please read Susan Orlean's "Orchid Thief" instead 
 It didn't take me long to forget this film. Once again it stars Jet in a strange role 
 This unit sounds ok.  And the sound-spa aspect is a nice difference.  However, none of the inserts that come with it fit the "new" iPod Nano.  I'm still waiting to hear from Homedics about getting an insert that fits.. 
 more of a novelty than a useful flashlight. need to shake it a lot to get a charge and even then the emitted light is too low to be useful. the switch has also broken and we havent even used the flashlight more than a couple times...would not recommend buying this flashlight, trying to return mine. 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 "The Collected Plays of Neil Simon, Vol. 1" is a nice anthology, but it's not full of his best works.  I loved Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs" (his two sequels weren't as good), so I have very high expectations for his plays.  Here's a brief review for each play:  "The Odd Couple" - I went into this play knowing I wouldn't really like it, since I didn't care for the movie or television show.  I found it too neurotic.  "Plaza Suite" - This was a very depressing play.  Affairs outside the marriage is such a common theme in Simon's plays, and it's becoming sickening.  "Barefoot in the Park" - The best play in this whole volume.  Witty and sensual.  The movie is just as superb.  "Come Blow Your Horn" - The mother in this play is hysterical, and she's what saves the play from boredom.  "The Star-Spangled Girl" - By far the stupidest play I've ever read.  "Last of the Red Hot Lovers" - Simon tried too hard to be funny. You can tell when he wants you to laugh, and I don't like that.  "Promises, Promises" - He should stay away from musicals!  Boring and petty.  Overall, this volume was a letdown, but one to have - nonetheless - if you're a Neil Simon fan.  I "sorta" recommend 
 I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex.    The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre.  All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention.  No such luck.  I used to love reading SB novels.  I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading.  No more.  In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann.  Granted, I never read SB for the suspense.  I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story.  If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter.  They do suspense so much better 
 41-year-old WASP here. I don't even give it 1 star, but must rate it according to Amazon rules.  No one who espouses "survival of the fittest" can also be anti-Semitic.  The Jews have succeeded, prospered, thrived for thousands of years. They ARE "survival of the fittest."   Their only "crime" is self-identity and allegiance to God, who chose and continues to bless them as His people -- despite their rejection of Jesus Christ (who is my Savior and Lord).  God told Abraham "I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee." This promise extended to Abraham's seed, aka the Jews.  If Mr. Duke wants to spit in the face of God's people, that's his prerogative. Your reward will be Divine punishment -- in this life or the next.  Let's also not forget that the U.S.A. was founded on the suffering, tears and misery of Native Americans and black slaves, the latter of whom were brought here by us against their will. As for the current immigration issue, we largely have greedy corporations (and just *who* are the CEO's of these corporations? Many white men as far as I can tell) to thank for this dilemma.  It's utter hypocrisy to stand up for white people on the basis of "survival of the fittest" and then to turn around and damn others for accomplishing the same thing. Social Darwinism is a bitter pill to swallow if you believe in it.  
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope.  This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.    The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks!  The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful.  I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects.  Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored.  NOT recommended 
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 This book takes a fascinating subject---the lives of Gypsies in the USA---and reduces it to anthropological formulae and scholarly babble. It might be impressive to other anthropologists, but it's largely unreadable  to mere mortals. It's a shame, because obviously the author has done some  interesting research on a people that are hidden within our midst 
 The kit was not worth its price. The spatial effect is poor. I've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red-blue paper glasses.  No, I don't have visual problem, and I rigged up everything correctly.  The DVDs itself were not interesting. My kids were not impressed much. It were not made me happier with the pack.  Sorry this review seems against the others, but it is my truth. I've stored it back into the box.  I don't recommend this for you 
 This book is poor. No way to use it. The "verses" are not original 
 This must have been fun to record but it feels to me like they were just having a lark w/country music. As a result, it's competently performed, but bland in a sort of Country Lite kind of way. When famous musicians cross genres, it's more rewarding when they at least bring us something new, or dive in w/both feet and give us the texture of the new genre--I was looking forward to something more. Instead, it's like hearing a good country cover band in a Las Vegas lounge (nothing wrong w/that, but at least in Vegas the music is free).  There are many better country or folk or bluegrass albums on the market right now that are more rewarding than this. Start with, say, "You Don't Know Me - Songs of Cindy Walker," just released by Willie Nelson, a better example of how to do a tribute album. 
 Rachel and Darcy. Best friends since grade school. Rachel is the average-looking one with good grades; Darcy is the good-looking one with average grades. Rachel has worked hard all her life and is a lawyer at a NY law firm (a very unhappy, overworked lawyer...). Darcy learned early on in life that thanks to her great looks, she doesn't have to work as hard to get what she wants. Therefore she has become a bit shallow and still has a lot of growing up to do. On Rachel's 30th birthday, Darcy throws her a party and Rachel gets drunk and sleeps with Darcy's handsome fiancï¿½, Dex. After sleeping together, Rachel and Dex realize they have loved each other all these 7 years . . .  now they are torn. Can they pursue their love and risk loosing Darcy?  I found this book fun to read in the beginning. Giffin is a vivid writer and I chuckled out loud because I could relate to many of the flashbacks of Rachel and Darcy growing up in the Midwest. But as the book progressed I started to loose respect for Rachel. Not only because she was completely betraying her best friend, but also because she lacked character and self esteem. In all aspects of her life (with Darcy, at her job and even with Dex) she was extremely insecure and meek. She lets others dominate her and is unable to stand up for herself. Even though I disagreed with her sleeping with her best friends fiancï¿½ I kept wondering why she wouldn't just tell Dex to leave Darcy and be with her (after all Dex kept telling her how much he loved her). I realize not everyone can have great self esteem and be secure in every aspect of his or her life but sleeping with your best friends fiancï¿½ is a very slimy way of gaining confidence.  I also think Giffin could have done a better job developing Dexter. His character lacked charisma and appeal. He is a lawyer and he's hot. OK. So what else made him so great that Rachel was willing to loose her life-long best friend for?   I read the sequel "Something Blue" to see what happens to Darcy and I liked that one better!!!! I also HIGHLY recommend Giffin's third and best book "Baby Proof" (that one is not about Rachel or Darcy!).     ***spoiler ahead**** My biggest gripe is that the author took the easy way out in the end with what happens with Darcy and Marcus. It was a cheap cop-out way to make Darcy the villain so you excuse Rachel and Dex's deceit.  Didn't work with me! Two wrongs don't make a right.            
 Throughout the years I have used and owned many different versions of the Brita Pitcher Water Dispenser. All of these filtered water containers have been great. The only complaint I have ever had with these filters is size. The Brita Ultramax Water Filter Dispenser was supposed to answer this problem. Unfortunately due to bad design, it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past Brita products.  Pro:  Size: This water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water. (Ironically, this is really a disadvantage; as you will find below.)  Con(s):  Mold: If you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days, you will get mold. This mold will probably make you ill (sore throat) (Conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system). To avoid this problem, the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least (to be safe you should wash it more often). I have never had this problem with Brita's other products (I have friends who never washed their Brita pitchers for months, and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it).  Left Over Water: Due to the faulty design of the product, there will be left over water both above the filter and below it. Besides turning the product upside down, you cannot dispense all of the water. This is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product. Not surprisingly, this helps further contribute to mold growth.  Conclusion:  Save your money and buy Brita's other well designed pitchers or even Pure's pitchers. (The key word is pitcher.) You will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product 
 Bought it because the author had compiled the book on Buffett's annual reports. Got really bored with this book however. It is written too acadamic style and mostly a reiteration of Graham/Buffet. You will be much happy if you read Intelligent Investor & Buffets Essay book. This book is just an attempt to make money by invoking the names of investment masters in its title. I got my lesson - Only buy books written by the investment gurus who write it from their hands-on experience 
 Some interesting points made, the author is too quick to draw a strong line connecting the "moral decay" of our society in part to non-traditional families.  She focuses too strongly on the negative statistics associated with our changing family structure while under-stating the benefits (and statistics) that show how this individualism has allowed our country to prosper and which has provided women and minorities a world of opportunities which did not exist 50 years ago 
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 My Daughter is 38" and about 30lbs.  It's the perfect size for her.  We mainly use it as something to lay on while watching TV or reading books on the floor.   PROS - When in the "chair position", it's tall enough to accommodate taller children. - Cover is removeable and washable - Comes with handy pink storage bag (although it's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed) - Pretty easy to convert into chair (there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be "connected" in order to change it into chair - they are color coded).  Might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it. - Inside of sleep bag is made of soft material (although it appears as though it may snag easily). - Large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag.  Easy for small hands to use. - Weight limit: 100 lbs   CONS - The Pump is VERY cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed (it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands). - The air slowly leaks out of the bed.  We actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased, so we exchanged for another one.  But this one too deflates pretty quickly.  Example: if we completely inflate at 7pm, by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40% of it's air. - Adult help is needed to change into chair. - Adult help is needed to inflate.  OVERALL: It's a bit pricey for the quality I was expecting.  It would be nice if adult assistance wasn't needed to change from bed to chair and back.  Defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night, but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 Yes, OK, Montessori is a great way for children to learn with play. Yes, many children can benefit greatly from this method. Yes, this book explictly lays out guidlines for this method, and includes lots of activities for preschoolers to do.  BUT, even as a stay-at-home mom, I cannot imagine doing more than two or three of these activities at home.  WAY too complex and involved. If you are a teacher, this book is for you. If you are a mom looking for educational activities to do with your children, look elsewhere.  I was very excited about recieving this book, but it just didn't cut it for me. I don't have a sand table at home, and I don't have time to read this whole book (which is surprisingly substantial). Can't I just do flash cards or some fun crafts instead 
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 I read this book on the advice of a review in the science journal, Nature.  But I must say that it is, at best, a monotonous, plot-free read. There is virtually no history of science here, no gripping detective story or expose, and it is certainly far from engrossing.  There are no personalities involved, little sensitivity to history, and so nothing to grab one's interest.  Except for the first chapter (concerning a law suit over a stolen copy), the rest of the book pretty much consists of a dry, bare-boned littany of the author's survey of extant copies of Copernicus' great treatise, De Revolutionibus.  There are a few entertaining comments about Edward Rosen (another historian of science fascinated with Copernican minutiae )that smack of professional rivalry (or perhaps a generational shift in science history studies?).  The rest of the chapters consist of lifeless prose on boring topics, with an rambling commentary on the then-current Cold War.  The book is tedious because it fails to breathe life into its topic.  But then, how could it? For it is little more than a glorified list of copies.  It took nearly all my gumption (not to mention a looong layover in Chicago O'Hare Airport) to even finish the book.  Stick to the highlights (Chapters 1-3, Plate 1a, and the photo on p. 198 of Galileo's horoscope for Cosmo d'Medici) and you'll have about all there is worth having here. 
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 My book club strikes again with this inane, predictable and hard to complete selection.  I think Kim Edwards found the novel difficult to finish writing, because the ending was even more bland and poorly developed than the rest of the book.  The premise of the novel is interesting enough, which is why I found it mildly engaging.  However, I found myself hating all the characters in the book (save Phoebe).  The metaphors the author uses are for the most part cheap, and are further deflated by their constant repetition.  How many starfish metaphors can she make in the course of just a few paragraphs?  Then there was the overuse of several phrases..."silverfish" is just one that comes to mind.  Still, this was Kim Edward's freshman novel, so I can excuse some of the overly-elaborated and amateur metaphors; hence the two star rating.  I had a difficult time trudging through this book to reach the end.  The middle section could have been half as long and still sufficed.  The characters were all, without exception, poorly developed and painfully uninteresting.  This doesn't make the invisible plot any more tolerable.  I would say that if you really wanted to feel like you wasted your time reading something, then choose this book.  There is certainly nothing to be gained by reading it 
 Though I'm a great fan of Gleick's other books, I found Faster annoying in the extreme.  True, it is replete with fascinating facts and insights.  After a couple of chapters, however, many of its fascinating facts and insights -- not infrequently organized into endless prose lists -- began to feel like so many bricks to the skullcap, waterdrops to the forehead, ...  Enough was enough was enough.  I listened to Faster (audiotape) on my commute to work.  Mornings 3-8 felt like Groundhog Day.    F(un/interesting 15 page magazine article) + C(affeine) + OCD + T(ime) +/- P(er-word-payment) = Faster.              
 I did not like the book because it's a country book. It's about a farmer that loves his farm and his wife. I don't like the animals on the farm or the colors on the pages and the people. They are so little. Thats why I don't like the book.  
 I was disappointed that this book beat out Donald Hall's for the price but then started to review it and bought it and love it. A valuable addition to any collection. ramp this up to a three star at leas 
 I had heard a few songs from Songbook in the store, and decided to try this 'live' album.  Unfortunately, this was quite disappointing.  Nothing of the magic that was Songbook.  Capable note-wise, Cassidy's delivery is however, very unmoving here.  It was, and is, very annoying, that I keep imagining this was all sung by Ann Wilson (of rock band Heart).  But this is the wrong kind of music for a voice like that; i.e. she doesn't sound good live 
 i ordered the item saying it was in-stock. but days passed i still havent received the item until i followed it up. i was told the item was in a back order. i think they shouldnt write in-stock if the item is really a back order meaning they dont have it. it delayed the item for 2-3weeks and it was suppose to be a gift. though i can say the item was nice when i got it 
 Still waiting....? Another failed post-cold war attempt at 'Mr X' (or Mr and Mrs X??) status...  
 Dudes.  This is the worst ever.  You gotta be kidding me.  Life is short.  Don't do it to yourself.  Please.  Do not buy this album.  It is so cheesy it hurts.  Get some Heavenly, older Belle and Sebastian, the Beach Boys. If you like these guys then you probably like the Barenaked Ladies.  And if you like these guys and you say you hate the barenaked ladies, then you are a hipster.  My bad.  I am dumb 
 I purchased the MD781 + MD71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the MD681.  I really like the MD681 but I could never locate one of its expansion handsets (everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock).  Overall I'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use I am already looking for another phone.    Handheld phones:  I like them more than any other phone I've tried.  Unlike most phones these days they're big and have a very solid feel to them...it's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation.  The buttons are a nice size and easy to use. The hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well. With one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good, but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation.  The shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better. It's a few clicks and slow to access...almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand...or copy the number to the local units phonebook...which defeats the purpose.  As for the Answer Machine:  Once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of  how many messages, if any, are in the system (is it just me or is that poor design), so if you listen to messages when you partner isn't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages.   The quality of voice messages is a bit grainy.  I also like how the handset docked in the older M681;  it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base...the MD781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk.  
 Kids in the 5-7 range will probably love this series with its dependable repetition of formulas that my kids loved to say out with me when we got to the best part of the book:  "The wind blew harder ... The treehouse started to spin ... faster and faster ... then everything was still.  Absolutely still."  The loyalty and friendship which bond brother Jack and sister Annie are also a refreshing break from sibling squabbles.  On the other hand, it's discouraging to watch the heroes of these books visit far-off times and places and learn virtually nothing about the places they go to, because the author is so ignorant about science, history and the English language (gravity varies depending on whether you're in a building or not; "thou" is a plural pronoun; etc.).  If you want your kids to learn anything from their readings, you'll have to delve a little deeper into the mass of children's literature than this trivial series 
 This book is a collection of American Rhymes and Jingles from all the ages.  It was written 1966, but many of the ryhmes in it are still around today.  Some examples are How Much Wood Could a Woodchuck Chuck, Mary had a Little Lamb, This Little Pig, and Star Light Star Bright.  This book is very well illustrated, compared to other books of this time period 
 A tribute is defined as "a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude, respect, or admiration."  That is what you have here. But, if you want a true picture of that incredible morning, don't waste your time and money, look elsewhere 
 First and foremost, I am a HUGE Jim Morrison fan.  I am also an avid seeker of truth and am interested in seeing how the other members of the band perceived Mr. Mojo Risin.  While John Densmore's book was very candid and dealt with the effects Jim's alcoholism had on The Doors, Mr. Manzarek attempts to justify Jim's behaviour by claiming it was part of his persona.  Ray is also very haughty throughout the book citing several examples of their audience "not getting it"-the "not getting" it parts were the audience responding to poor performances.  His constant reminders of being antiestablishment grew weary after the first couple of chapters.  Raymond does everything he can to glorify Jim, despite Jim's obvious destructive behaviour.  If you're a true Doors fan, don't waste your time with this one.  I wish Robby would write one, in my opinion John's book coupled with Break On Through gives the best window into what Jim's life with the Doors was like.   
 Jason Becker and Marty Friedman had a real partnership going on. While Marty was able to capitalise on this good start circumstances prevented jason from doing so.  On the basis of this album alone whoever it would seem that he perhaps had less to offer, at least if you didn't hear some of this other albums. But to be brutally honest this is pretty bog standard widdly diddly.  The tunes seem to just keep on coming with endless streams of solos in a very clean, very 80's way. Little feeling, little groove and no real reason for repeated playing. Excuses can be made for him - given the photo on the back of the album it's clear he was incredibly young and not likely to be able to stamp much authority or personality over these shreds. It may be of interest to some that Mr Friedman guest solos on no less that three tunes.  It it was possible to give 1/2 stars then I'd give this 2.5 - after all, anyone who calls an instrumental rock guitar album Perpetual Burn has to have some sense of humour and deserves respect!  PS - people keep on giving this review negative votes - like that's going to stop the album sucking or something. Or cos they thing it's uncool to bag out an album by Jason Becker, who faced so much personal adversity. If your of the second type, read my review of his album Perspective and if you still hate me then come back and give this (another) negative vote. There, I feel better now... 
 As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication.   Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you.. 
 This book gives a good overview of modern synthetic methods, but with mistakes on almost every page, it is not worth the trouble to figure out exactly what he is talking about.  The book is exhaustively referenced, however, allowing quick access back into the primary literature to get more detailed explanations and clarifications 
 and THEN come follow  Jesus orders us when someone asks for our coat to give our shirt as well.  It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to get into heaven. Or a capitalist. Jesus said it, not me.  Capitalism is the opposite of Christianity. Study carefully the National Conference of Catholic Bishop's landmark letter Economic Justice for All which damns corporate capitalism as currently practiced under the unelectable Bush regime.   Read the Rev. Father John Dear, SJ. Anything he wrote. Read the most saintly and Catholic Dorothy Day. Winess her life of Chritian witness.  Capitalists cannot be Christian. There is no profit in it. If someone wants your money you give it to them, with a joyful and sincere smile.  Read your Dorothy Day, the greatest American CAtholic EVER! Loaves and Fishes is a good place to start. She said not to give our old clothes to the poor; give them our new clothes instead.  Go back and read your Saint Francis too. What did he say? How did he read and live the Gospel? What did he have?  What would Jesus do? Amass wealth? What did he have when he died?  Even Karl Marx got it closer when quoting Saint Paul that the Christian Community derived from each member according to their talents and gave to each member according to their needs.  This is the OPPOSITE of capitalism which bleeds everyone through their needs (health, housing, food, education, clothing, etc.) and in which the rich alone get richer.  That ain't Christianity by any measure.  Christ leads to true freedom. Not capitalism. Meanwhile: Is the West a success?   And those who believe the hierarchcal church promoted the scientific method need only remember it was not a quarter century the church apologized to the late Galileo, and as recently as the pioneering (ought to be saint) Father Gregor Mendel the church burned his notebooks posthumously and prohibited his publication, of what has now become the basis of biology: genetic codes. 
 Exactly just how many "greatest hits" albums are going to be released from this greatest band of the 80's?  Do we really need so many different CDs with the same songs on them?  How about getting some of those videos ("Single Vision", "Into The Gap Live", etc) digitally remastered onto DVD!! 
 After reading this book, I still haven't got a clue what magic is about.  This one goes to the trash bin 
 Eleanor Roosevelt is truly a fascinating character, but this book is absolutely painful to read.  Cook makes references to topics before addressing them, makes characters difficult to follow, and generally botches what could be a great subject.  Look elsewhere for Eleanor Roosevelt 
 Has society become so stupid that we need our fictional novels explained to us now?  The Da Vinci Code is a fun read but it's fiction.  It's FICTION.  Do you really need someone to explain that to you?  I'm wondering Bock himself understands the difference between fiction and non-fiction.  Either way seems like Bock has found a way to milk even more cash out of people over this whole Da Vinci craze.  And considering that I just saw him on television arguging over the Lost Tomb of Jesus.  Well, I'm sure he'll come out with a book about that now.  Get ready to fork over more money to him suckers.  
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 I was excited when I saw this book with such a title.  But it turned out to be one of the worst (popular math book) I have read in the last few years.  Then I read the review by sporkdude on November 7, 2004 (thanks sporkdude!).  He made some very good suggestions (that we should ignore all the odd chapters but a handful of pages, if not ignore the whole book at all).  I gave the book a  second chance, but it just once again confirmed that it's a really badly written book.  I can tell you why.  On page xiii of the book, the auther claims that "I don't believe the Riemann Hypothesis can be explained using math more elementary than I have used here, so if you don't understand the Hypothesis after finishing my book, you can be pretty sure you will never understand it."  Is it true?  What I am sure is that you will not understand what Riemann Hypothesis is after finishing this book.  The author never tried to get to the point, or I would say he was incapable in doing so.  Even worse, you wouldn't be able to grisp a big picture of what the hypothesis was all about, as the author jumped around too much, that you're not sure what it's all up for.  Together with his tedious writing style (e.g. he likes to throw you with some random decimal numbers upto a hundred digits), it won't take you too long to realize it's just a waste of time to keep on reading this book.  It is "amazing" that such a book would get an average of 4.5 stars by 62 reviewers.  If it was your very first popular math book and you found it delightful, I can assure you that there're some a lot better popular math books out there waiting for you to explore 
 You have to read about 180 pages of this book before any action starts. I was frankly bored by the entire book. Once the action starts, it's fairly contrived. Reacher is one of those very lucky or very unlucky "heros." And if you're one of those readers who like to try to figure out who is doing the dirty deeds, you can't. There are absolutely no clues you can use to determine the perpetrators.  And who says the Secret Service doesn't act proactively? While this is one of the book's major premises, the history of the Service is filled with proactive activities to protect those who come under their care.  I remember once when the President came to my hometown and spoke on the Statehouse steps. Office workers in nearby buildings used telescopes to get a better view. All of them were seen by Secret Service agents and men with guns visited them in one big hurry. Radios were used in abundance. And this was over thirty years ago. Do you think the Service has become more capable or less capable since then? If a single radio was used in this story, the perpetrators would have been caught about halfway through the book.  When President Bush (the first one) wanted to walk across the Mackinac Bridge for the annual walk, they took over the entire hotel where he would be staying, and not because they needed the space. A list of others who would be in attendance during the walk and at the dinner the previous evening had to be vetted starting 6 weeks prior to his visit, including local police. They even kept the pitcher of ice tea that he would be drinking from in a locked box watched over by an agent (same with condiments). After spending a bazillion dollars up to and after the President's meal, the Prez graciously paid for his own meal, and left a nice tip. Big of him. So agents don't just show up a couple of hours or in one case in the book, a few minutes before the big event, and throw a cordon around him.   I was also left with some unexplained questions at the end.  So, it's dull, inaccurate, and an insult to those brave souls who protect our nation's leaders 
 This book is horrible - not at all funny.  Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 A mysterious car accident claims two lives.  One man witnesses it.  Same man loves a woman who marries the driver (who was also in and survives the accident).  A priest is also in love with the woman.  Half way thru the  book, nothing else has happened.  3/4 of the way thru the book nothing else  has happened.  Once in awhile they talk about the mystery surrounding the  car crash.  The mystery to me is why I'm still reading this book.  It must  be because the style is enjoyable.  There sure isn't any plot.  Greeley's  style is definitely fun, but other than that I'm not sure what this book  has to offer.  Nice cover,tho 
 This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability.  It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between.  There are very few "plot twists," and those which do occur are far from surprising.  From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly.  This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable.  The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plo 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 The game has weak content and strategy.  We played it twice but neither of us experienced any excitement.  The game is now shelved and I don't foresee it ever being played again.  Disappointed but somehow not surprised. 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Madonna's best was during the early and mid-80's.  This album proved that she jumped the shark by 1987 and has been famous for who she is ever since.  
 I don't know, even at half price, I still feel it is not worth the money. The reviews here differ so widely that the truth has to lie somewhere in the middle. In the case of this book, most people are reacting on a emotional level than an objective level. The people who love this book gush about the warm memories etc, while the people who hate this book talk about how TVparty didn't meet expectations. I think I will fall on the side of not meeting my expectations. If you really look at this book objectively, it doesn't do what it says or advertises.   The price of admission was not worth it because much of the info is pretty much common knowledge. Since I didn't get any warm fuzzies from the stories, I can only rate it in an objective manner. The book fails to deliver 
 I live in CE, a state of Brazil and I like to read books. About twenty years ago, I tried to read this trash-book.This book is so bad, that I didn't ended it.  A trash-book is a bigoted book?This book is bigoted. A trash-book is a false book?This book is false. A trash-book is an outdated book?This book is outdated. A trash-book is a biased book?This book is 100% biased.  In late 1940 and at beggining of 1950 decade, this book was a best-seller in USA.With the advance of the time, not even the author could believe, in these bogus claims. The author itself, Paul Blanshard,at that time was a protestant preacher and claimed to be a freedom's champion, became later a communist and of course an atheist too. The core's idea of this book is that, Catholic Church is the biggest menace to USA's freedom. Well, what happened more than 50 years later?The opposite. Every USA's foe is also, a Pope's foe. See to example: Iran's president, North Korea's strong man, Fidel Castro,etc. are all non-catholics and also foe of catholicism and USA. This book is bigoted, bogus, ridiculous and outdated. Even if you are a bigoted anti-catholic person, there's better options to read, than this trash-book.   
 Ehhh... I'm just not real impressed with this one.  First of all - splitting the larger sun sign categories into subgroups is kinda nice, but also kinda vague.  It's essentially a re-working of the standard sun sign stereotypes, and if you're interested in astrology at all, you know them already.  Don't get me wrong - it's not *bad.*  There's no wrong information, it's passably accurate (for astrology.)  I can see how it would be very helpful for those on cusps, and even for the rest of us, it's occasionally got some new info (this book, for instance, is the first one to accurately point out some quieter aspects of my personality that go against the Aries norm.)  It's just not enough to get excited over, and most people will get the same level of accuracy or better by just going whole hog and getting a star chart done.  Secondly, and more irritatingly, the actual relationship pairings were astonishingly scattershot.  I think it would have been easier to deal with if they'd ALL just been laughably wrong, but no - after slogging through, say, 4 or 5 descriptions that could have been describing total strangers (because they certainly weren't describing me and my people), I'd hit upon something like "Confidential Projects," which was just a spot-on explanation of the vibe between me & my brother.  What do you do with a book like that?  (Also?  As has been noted by other reviewers, the book really is amazingly negative about almost every relationship pairing.  If I were to take it seriously, I'd be huddled in the corner now, wide-eyed, whimpering "nobody loves me and I have no real friends!"  Sheesh.)  It leads me to one of two conclusions: 1) it really is scattershot - they're just throwing it at a wall and seeing what sticks; or, 2) they're actually on to something, but haven't worked out all the kinks yet.  Which wouldn't be too bad, except that it's being published as a finished product, you know?  Final recommendation: pass.  If you're reading for entertainment, there are more entertaining astrology books out there; if you're a serious student, there are more thorough and accurate books.  If you've got money to burn and don't mind weeding through the stuff that's superfluous and the stuff that's just inaccurate to find the few true additions to this field that this book makes, it might make a decent addition to round out a library.  Just please don't be fooled into thinking this is the be-all and end-all of relationship astrology 
 My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
 While the 'real' version of this movie, as shown on Cinemax and as sold in VHS, is about 90 minutes long, this DVD is only 71 minutes long.    Forget what the product description says, it is wrong! This is movie is a heavily edited version of Hotel Exotica with almost 20 minutes of footage cut!  Amazon should either stop selling this DVD or correct the information about it to say that it is NOT and uncut version and that it is only 71 minutes long.  
 I bought 12 of these 4 years ago.. for use exclusively in mole chaser devices (slow continuous drain).  Was recently surprised that they've started to lose charge within days, and even fail to charge (in the accu charger).. not quite the "charge over a 1000 times" I was sold on. Over the four years, I had to recharge them every about once a month.. which works out to 48 times before they gave up the ghost. Was about to buy more of these things, until reading the other reviews and seeing the other hi-end rechargeables (ie MAHA).  Not sure what I'll do next 
 I remember when Trouble came out, I thought it was such a great song-  then I got Law And Order- what a mess!  This is something Lindsey should have made for his friends- as exoerimental as some of his stuff was on Tusk, this is way beyond that- some songs are unlistenable to me-  pass it by 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 I'm not sure how anyone could possibly sit through this overblown, miscast, boring example of Hollywood at it's worst.  Gary Cooper has to be the most uncharismatic and non-talented actor to ever achieve star status.  It's pretty sad to me that Hollywood felt the need to cast a Swedish actress to play the part of a Spanish girl named Maria.  Were there no latino actresses working in 1943?  Total waste of celluloid and time 
 Gillon writes with an exciting and entertainly style. I enjoyed reading it, as much as I enjoy someone like Neil Gaiman. Neil writes good fiction and he entertains me. Gillon writes entertaining non-fiction, but it's not representative of most of us.  For someone, like myself, from the boomer generation, the people he selected as examples could not have been more different than me or any of the people my age. One fellow sold a business for $270 million. A woman obtained her PhD. Another woman spearheaded a successful campaign for breast cancer. Another fellow has several successful TV shows. I don't know people like that. I don't drink beer with them. They have success in their lives that only 1 in 10,000 people find, maybe more. They are celebrities.  I couldn't relate to real life people he talked about. Sorry, but I couldn't connect the changes in America with what these 4 people did with their lives either.  The people I know, work, pay their bills, worry about raising their children, and how they will get along after they retire. During the last 30 years, the people Gillon didn't talk about, struggled to get a good education, get a good job, keep the job, and hold their marriage together. They are in debt up to their eyeballs. Gillon's characters were building billion dollar businesses, getting PhD's, meeting the President, or having their TV shows on a national network.  Good for them, I am happy for them, but no one I know has any experience living a charmed life these people have.  I hope Gillon makes lots of money and becomes famous, because that is what he admires.  I hope my family loves me, I set a good example in my neighbor hood, and I can help someone along their way.  Different strokes for different folks, as they say 
 I think this book was over written with a lot of fillers to make the book seem longer.  There was a lot of unnecessary off the topic information to read that did not help to convey the lives of the autistic adults.  I don't believe that the author has autism because he skips so many parts of his own childhood to only express what has happend to his classmates.  Its amazing that the 4 autistic adults have successful careers and yet no one talks of the struggles they should have had to make it through elementary, high-school and college. The most informative information the author could have given parents like me with a child with autism is truely how where they able to learn to read and write and speak.  It just doesn't happen overnight without a process.  All the adults seemed to have been mainstreamed by middle school with no explanation of their struggle through school. I question if this book is true 
 While hiding behind the mantle of saying that the book is based on a many-million dollar study by the MacArthur Foundation, in fact, it is little more than a feel-good book. To so disproportionately minimize the  role of genetics in the aging process, while relying only fuzzy,  methodologically weak studies to support its contraintuitive notions,  renders this book just a step above pop-psych "You can be anything you  want" books 
 I agree with the complaints already written about the toy falling apart easily.  Also, the sounds are really annoying and they get set off very easily.  I was just about to make the batteries "die" when three of the screws became loose and we had to take the toy away until we could fix it.  We looked everywhere for a screwdriver w/ a triangle shape to tighten them back into place, but haven't been able to find one. Although my son has been asking frequently if the toolbox is fixed, he really has been having as much fun just using the diecast vehicles by themselves 
 One of those few books that one can say the movie was much more livelier.  In the book we never know whether Fast Eddie pays Bert the money that he wins in the final game and of course Sarah does not go with Bert and Eddie to Lexington. On the whole it was a lifeless novel. It seems the reputation of Tevis is based more on the success and acting of Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason , Piper Lori as well as the direction of Robert Rossen than anything that he wrote. I was not impressed by his writing. I loved the movie 
 I agree with Tinhorn - this is a disappointing effort.  After the first CD, definitely a step down....not a total loss, but rather lifeless 
   I gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary.  It falls more along the same fodder as "Spinal Tap".  It is missing a counter point from GM.  One could argue that Roger had chances to talk with Moore, but choose not to.  One the other hand, Rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold.  I believe that Moore counted on not being granted air time at GM for the production of this film.  An interview would have killed the tone.   Watch the nightly news NOW.  Last night, March 22nd 2006, GM offered a one time buy out to some of it's employees.  The news reported that GM cannot afford to maintain its relationship with the UAW (Just like what caused the Flint situation in the film).  This same thing happened in the late 1980's and brought forth this extremely biased movie.  This film is entertaining in a strange way, but should not be considered to be the absolute truth.  Watch it with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, Under close examination, Careful consideration and Keen intellect, you will see a undercover message You might need to examine closely the content. Outwardly, things are not what they seem Until you look more closely. Many times the basic concept is Misread in the dialog Once you see this, and Open your mind to it, Rational thought will Emerge 
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 This is the worst album I've ever purchased. If I wasn't going to return it, I would burn it 
 Having read "Further Along the Road Less Traveled", and its predecessor "The Road Less Traveled" I had great expectations for this book.  I was gravely disappointed, however, to find that it was  nothing more than an annotated bibliography (of sorts) of every book that  Peck has written to date.  It is, simply put, a long advertisement of the  author's writing and practice accomplishments.  I wouldn't suggest anyone  flatter his ego any more by buying this book 
 This book is a joke.  It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said.  He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book.  The "secrets" are not secrets at all.  They are common sense to most people.  After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter.  It's all summed up there.  Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together 
 Beautifully illustrated book and perfect for dumbing down your child. Imagine silly Elmo, role model, talking about bedtime. Elmo has little to offer in this book. My daughter isn't allowed to and doesn't come up with 100 things she must do before going to bed. Why let Elmo teach her to stall or manipulate? If I read this book to her, she may need to check under the bed, water the plants, open the window and look outside, feed the fish, run out of the room to check to see if the water was left running, check to make sure the cap is on the toothpaste, close the window, et cetera before going to bed.  I have a collection of now over 300 children's books and this one just doesn't offer much. There are so many better books out there--many classics which are engaging and silly, but ALSO teach kids lessons on HOW TO LIVE AND ACT.  Often both parents are working these days and there is less time that they are around to teach their children about morality and how to live. Why waste time with this book? Even that purple dinosaur has more to offer 
 This is a book that could (should?) have faded into history without being a great loss to the world. Yes, there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy, but they're far and few between, and mainly either just thrown out as Montesquieu's personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination, or flimsily based on historical examples. As a reader, I didn't find most of his arguments (where he didn't seem to be contradicting himself, which happens frequently) very convincing. This was obviously written with the 18th century French salon crowd in mind, and reads as such. I'm sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time, but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history.  He claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal; well, I did read the whole book and at the end couldn't see an overarching structure at all. The work just seemed like a long, rambling, unorganized mess. The only people I might really recommend this to are people interested in Greek, Roman, and French history (especially legal history), but not to people interested in political science or philosophy.  Bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought, there are much more interesting reads out there 
 I prefer the "Shrink Your Female Fat Zones" DVD with the balance ball. I really don't like the resistance strap with this one and I will probably sell my DVD, because I just don't like it. Denise does some great videos, but this isn't among them. 
 Ms. Douglas is not the most skilled of writers, but has made up for it in the previous entries into this series with direction and period detail, which allowed the reader to be carried along.  There was much redundancy of detail in this offering, sometimes almost verbatim descriptions just a few pages hence, making me wonder if either the editor was attempting to combine various drafts in a hurry, or different writers wrote sections and the parts were hastily assembled 
 I am a big Catherine Coulter fan, but this book is awful.  You can skip all the Soap scenes, a waste of space.  Much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat.  Don't waste the $6, borrow from the library if you want to read 
 Visually appealing but without much of a plot or acting talent.  Not nearly as good as "Valerie and Her Week of Wonders" 
 It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!  Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.  First things first, the Lovers- Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end. Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is  shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.  Next we have the plot- As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how "sweet" and "fine" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.   My Opinion- The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless "Yes", "No"s, and "All right"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers 
 "It must now be self-evident that there is a vast gulf between the Jesus of history and the Jesus of faith."  This is Baigent's theme in "The Jesus Papers."  But does he succeed?  Does he provide evidence to prove his assertion, or even lead a careful reader to consider his claim probable?  No.  Not even close.  Mr. Baigent's method is flawed.  For example, he frequently calls into question the reliability of early historical documents, while relying heavily on anecdotal material, which is often relatively late from a historical perspective.  At times this "evidence" exists simply as the word of one person living in the 20th century.  Another problem is that Baigent is guilty of special pleading.  He discredits the New Testament Gospel accounts which are contrary to his beliefs as unreliable, but then quotes from the gospels when they help establish his point.  Often it is apparent that Mr. Baigent has left behind the realm of historical facts and entered the realm of speculation because he pauses in his narrative to ask questions such as "Could it be...?", "Is it perhaps possible that...?", etc.  But, once he has asked the questions, his answers to his own speculations are considered proven true, and he addresses them accordingly through the rest of the book.  Unfortunately, I don't have the space here to document his countless speculations, errors, and distortions.  Here are just a few.  Perhaps the single most outrageous claim in the book is the assertion that Jesus survived the crucifixion.  However, Jesus' death by crucifixion is so widely accepted that virtually no skeptic continues to entertain this possibility.  The event of his death is affirmed by Christian and non-Christian sources, as well as by the general expertise the Romans possessed in this manner of execution.  Baigent comments that Jesus, if he died on the cross, would have died more quickly than expected.  He neglects, however, to mention that Jesus first endured being severely beaten with a three-lash whip with pieces of bone or metal on the ends.  This whip tore the flesh of the skeletal muscles and set the stage for circulatory shock.  Following the scourging that Jesus received, he was probably in serious to critical condition prior to his crucifixion.  During the crucifixion, he sustained five additional serious wounds, including the wounds caused by the nails and the spear in His side, which almost certainly pierced one lung and the heart.  According to a 1986 article entitled "On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ" which appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association, "Clearly, the weight of the historical and medical evidence indicates that Jesus was dead before the wound to His side was inflicted and supports the traditional view that the spear, thrust between His right ribs, probably perforated not only the right lung but also the pericardium and heart and thereby ensured his death.  Accordingly, interpretations based on the assumption that Jesus did not die on the cross appear to be at odds with modern medical knowledge."  In addition to the medical evidence, the death (and resurrection) of Jesus is evidenced by the behavior and experiences of the disciples.  It is nearly unanimously accepted among historical scholars (including such skeptics as "Jesus Seminar" members Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan) that Jesus' disciples, following his crucifixion, were initially discouraged and despondent but shortly afterward had multiple experiences that they believed were actual appearances of the risen Jesus.  Additionally, due to these experiences, the disciples' lives were completely transformed, to the extent that they were willing to die for their belief that they had seen the resurrected Jesus.  It is utterly nonsensical to suggest that this level of belief and commitment could have been inspired by their experience of a badly wounded, bloodied, extremely sick Jesus barely clinging to life.  This scenario could explain their belief that they had seen him alive, but not their claim to have seen him resurrected.  Rather than relying on early historical documents to support his claim, Mr. Baigent's assertion that Jesus survived the crucifixion is based largely on the suggestion of one 20th century man, who claimed to have learned it directly from another man, who is supposed to have seen an elusive document making this claim.  This story will only convince the gullible.  By comparison, a surprising number of ancient historical texts (which are not elusive) record the death of Jesus, including a number of highly respected, primitive creeds that predate the New Testament, the Gospel narratives themselves, at least ten non-Christian texts, and several noncanonical early Christian sources.  In contrast to the evidence presented by Baigent, these sources provide multiple early evidences for the event of the death of Jesus by crucifixion.    Similar arguments can be made to refute other assertions made by Mr. Baigent, including Jesus' denial that he was the son of God, the relative reliability of the Gnostic Gospels, the supposedly lost years of Jesus in Egypt, the claim that Christianity was essentially the creation of Paul, and many others.    In chapter 13, Mr. Baigent laments what he refers to as the lack of "pure historians" in the field of biblical scholarship.  It seems we are justified in assuming that he would categorize himself in this manner, yet his haphazard acceptance and rejection of various data disqualifies him as a scholar.  Hardly objective, his sole test for evidence is whether it supports to his own view. 
 We subscribed to this magazine, in part due to the special offer of 12 free cycling booklets & road log with each new subscription.  What did we get?  A note letting us know that unfortunately "the gift described in the promotion is no longer available" and that "rather than keep us waiting, (they've) taken the liberty of sending the enclosed substitute..." The substitute?  A crummy little pamphlet.   I let it slide at the time, but several months later they were still offering this special promotion, so I wrote a letter to customer service stating that "since they now had the special gift, perhaps they'd be so good as to finally send ours."  No response.  Time came to renew and all of a sudden there was that offer again... so against my better judgement, we did.  And guess what!  Another note "unfortunately the gift described in the promotion is no longer available..."  and the same crummy pamphlet!    In short, if you're interested in being lied to, or receiving a stupid little pamphlet, by all means subscribe... if you want what you paid for, go somewhere else. 
 this is the cutest furreal I have seen it could have been much better if they would have made it where it would open it's mouth. ...Why did it come with a bottle? all ir does is grunt and beg. doesn't walk and it's eyes do not close so you can't pretend it is asleep. I can't return it cause it was a valantine's present but at least it is cute as just a stuffed pig 
 Being a player of AOE III, and having purchased the excellent guide by Sybex, I was expecting the same quality, but no such luck.  This guide is almost useless. It doesn't offer the detail to the different civs and does not give enough detail on stats for the different military units.   It spends too much time addressing the campaign, which frankly is one of the lamest aspects of the expansion.  Don't waste your money. 
 mosier is the worst type of historical writer, really a historical fiction writer.  he just makes up stuff as he sees fit, like 'hitler was the genius behind all the germans' successes' and claims inane things like 'the ablest german generals and field marshals were simply great captains but not great generals'.  mosier is the quintessential fat grognard who's played too many games of axis and allies and believes that makes for a well-rounded education of the second world war.   1. hitler ordered the 6th army to stand firm when they could have broken out to the west, losing around 300,000 men or so. 2. hitler refused von manstein's attempts to follow through in operation zitadelle, which in effect threw away all the hard fought gains in the southern part of the bulge. 3. while generals like rommel and guderian may indeed have been greater 'captains' as opposed to great strategic commanders, von manstein was easily the best strategic commander of modern warfare.   despite this, cross of iron is really a tame book.  those two statements are really all mosier contributes in the book, the only 'shocking' revelations.  for pure shock/stupid value, his novel 'the myth of blitzkrieg' was a far more entertaining and fanciful read.   
 Forget about this garbage. This is a book for vain, shallow, fancy-lads.  Bodybuiling is gay...real tough-guys do powerlifting, strongman, or olympic-lifting. Read a book on powerlifting instead. It doesnt matter what you look like as long as you can smash your enemies 
 If you are a complete beginner with respect to many of the skills needed for Ajax: HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, then this book might be for you.  All of the O'reilly Head First/Head Rush series are excellent teaching books and do a wonderful job at teaching skills in small bite-size chunks.  Lots of pictures, exercises and games.  This is about as fun as a book can get.  But once you've read the book, you'll realize that you really didn't cover much ground at all.  400 pages of Head Rush Ajax is about the same amount of Ajax technical material as 40 pages of Ajax in Action.  All those fun pictures and games take up a lot of pages!  Only the most basic topics of Ajax are covered.  Much of the book is wasted explaining web-development 101 level subjects...  So it wasn't possible for me to give the book 2 different ratings.  As a pure beginner's book - this is a 4 or 5 star book.  But if you already know HTML, HTTP, DOM, and CSS -- then this book becomes a 2 star Ajax book because it teaches so little about Ajax.       
  People actually gave this movie 5 stars! Are they for real? If you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you. It is fun to watch, but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking. It is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are. Their are so many Scar Face ripoffs it's offencive, and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said "Okay, we don't have much film left, we gotta' rap this up real quick. DMX, find religion...and cut." Rent the movie, try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying, ignore the horrible acting of Naz, then return it. And when you review it please don't give it five stars, those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop, not just some "Phat movie you and some down ass playas' watched while moms was outta' da' house. 
 This guy is a serious jerk.  Don't buy this book and support his cause -- which is anti-everything-decent.  Buy Al Franken's book on him instead -- much more accurate and interesting 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 Roger Ebert is a great movie reviewer and he is the most famous film critics in The United States, but this book will be an unnecessary waste of money.  To find all these reviews, a film lover just has to go to Ebert's website on the Internet.  There, the reader will find all these reviews and many more!   
 First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.  But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.  It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy. 
 but it was a waste of money as my cats had zero interest in the grass 
 I was drawn to the New York Public Library's series on the seven deadly sins for its stated aim of examining the ways in which faith, belief, ideology, and politics shape our contemporary world. I read this last book in the series first and was left bitterly disappointed.  Dyson pays lip service to the long and intriguing history of pride as a sin (pp. 7-26); in truth, he is a poor chronicler of the theological and philosophical roots of the notion of pride, or self-regard. It's tempting to suggest that Dyson composed this short chapter based on only a cursory reading of a handful of books that address the topic more substantively. His analysis of pride from Pope Gregory I to Stanley Hauerwas rings hollow and reads like a middle-school book report.  But the lack of "critical reflection" to which I refer in my review title stems from Dyson's mobilization of his own self-regard in the rest of this unfortunate book. Aside from the brief chapter mentioned above, Dyson offers blustering criticism of contemporary errata -- almost every example of which does not illuminate the complexities of pride as both concept and practice.  If anything, Dyson's examples shore up his own rhetorical self-worth and display an astounding lack of concern for broader social, political, and cultural views on pride. A chapter devoted to "Personal Pride" (pp. 27-42) is an insincere reflection on the ups and downs of Dyson's childhood and career, while his later discourses on versions of white and black pride are so simplistic (e.g., the KKK espouses a "bad" form of pride; Halle Berry's winning the Academy Award in 2002 evinces a "good" form of pride) as to insult the reader's intelligence. Finally, Dyson's profound ignorance of the posturing of his own critical voice is exemplified in two moments of particular resonance: when he defends himself against critics of his biography of Martin Luther King Jr. and, in a scene of unintended humor (for the reader) and false modesty (on Dyson's part), when he takes two black female students to task for being disruptive in a class he taught at the University of Pennsylvania.  These are just some of Dyson's prideful follies; the book as a whole replaces meaningful consideration of this purpoted "deadliest" of sins with Dyson's all-too-familiar -- indeed tiresome -- hobby horses and sound bytes. This book is about him, then, and I suppose to that extent it is a book about pride.  On a parting note, let me offer this retroactive disclaimer. As someone who identifies with progressive political and social causes, I am dismayed by a book like this because it displaces genuine critical reflection for brash but ultimately hollow showmanship. The series of which this book is a part offers up the possibility of doing some real *thinking* about important issues in our contemporary world. Progressive politics, in my view, should flow from the primary act of thought, reflection, critique -- whatever you want to call it. Dyson, although nominally a progressive, is in the business of repeating political ideologies that have become old hat. This book could have been written, and imagined, otherwise 
 Ring of Darkness (David DeCoteau, 2004)  Former porn director David DeCoteau, whose most notable mainstream flicks have been the Puppet Master franchise (he directed 3, 4, and 5, the last two under assumed names), takes an absolutely brilliant idea and makes an incredibly stupid movie out of it. Now, to be somewhat fair, not only is it a made-for-TV shlockfest, but one that certainly didn't have the budget of a Danielle Steel miniseries (IMDB estimates the film's budget at three-quarters of a million dollars). Still, it would be hard for this movie to be worse than it actually turned out; about the only thing that saves it is its premise and the fact that DeCoteau took nothing seriously.  We open with Gordo (Club Dread's Greg Cipes) fleeing from a mansion. Just as he gets to the beach and seems as if he's going to get away, he's cornered by four dark shapes. Cut to an announcement that boy band Take Ten are auditioning for a new lead singer. (I'm sure you can draw the proper conclusion.) After a round of auditions, during which you're liable to get as sick of the catchy little tune they play just as much as you did any nineties boy band hit, the four remaining members of the band choose three possible replacements for Gordo-- Shawn (Guiding Light actor Coltin Scott), Jonah (DeCoteau staple Jeff Peterson), and Xavier (Baywatch's Jeremy Jackson), who are all flown, with Xavier's girlfriend Stacy (American Idol finalist Ryan Starr, whom you will be pleased to know does not sing at any point in the film), to the band's island mansion. Which, of course, looks very familiar. As the three continue the auditions in a slightly more stressful situation, weird things start happening...  With all the young-and-beautiful male skin on display, you're likely to think you're watching a Victor Salva flick. However, comparisons with the superior Salva end there; DeCoteau directs as if Ring of Darkness (the title, by the way, has absolutely nothing to do with the movie itself) were his first film, not his fifty-second. I haven't seen this much obvious shot repetition in a movie since Night of the Lepus. The acting is atrocious, as one would expect from folks who cut their teeth in T&A-fests (the two notable exceptions to this are Adrienne Barbeau, who plays the band's manager, and Coltin Scott), the script is bad even for a horror-flick parody, and the whole thing is just on the right side of unwatchable to keep you glued to the screen.  Or maybe you just want to watch a boy band get theirs. I know that was my motivation.  
 This was not my favorite or most useful book for when I set out to homestead. Although it has a lot of good information in it, it is too dense and hard to read through, and too hard to find info immediately as I need it. I read it occasionally, but found the Storey books much more useful for practical, look-it-up-now information. 
 i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective-like game.  unfortunately, this game is very kid-like.  here's an example.  the first non auto-generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy.  these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children's word game book.  i easily got all of them except 1, meaning i couldn't progress past this point.  no problem for me, because by this time i didn't want to!  i'm not saying it's a bad game, it's just probably not a good game for grownups. 
 this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything. i didn't even like the story. i would give this book a big fat ZERO if i could!! 
 Bad, bad, bad movie. Bad. Insipid acting (particularly on Theron's part), horrible writing, it's unbelieveable, paper-thin and most of it is truly boring, despite the backdrop of war, death, Nazis and Paris. It takes a genuine lack of talent to be able to pull that off. While the costuming and the soundtrack are fantastic, the movie looks like it's been set on a soundstage producers would use in the 40's, I had a hard time believing most of the sets were on locatio, and they just looked fake. And the ending, pooh. By that time, you barely care about the characters and hope the thing just ends quickly. A very irritating a cheesy movie, it tries desperately to be aloof and melodramatic at the same time. Ugh 
 If we follow Ledeen off the Machiavellian cliff, what is left of the dream of the Founding Fathers for us to defend? This book illustrates one thing that is very important: in times of stress, normally intelligent people lose their sense of reason and let partisanship, xenophobia, or even megalomania rule their thoughts. Ledeen tells us to pursue the very course our forefathers rejected when they founded the USA, and he says it without the slightest trace of irony. Unfortunately for Ledeen, he negates his own title, for if we follow his prescription, those who "hate our freedoms" have already won by causing errant and misguided patriots to subvert the framework which supported those freedoms. Unfortunately for all of us, Ledeen has been taken seriously and literally by the Bush administration. Laws, Constitution, and even Geneva conventions are ignored because the end supposedly justifies the means. History says otherwise. Ledeen apparently believes that his book represents the moment in which historical patterns no longer apply to our world. Historians, if there are any left, will tell us whether he was right.

 Republicans lose an election, and what do they do? They go right back to the stupid practices that got them kicked  out of office.  Yes, Republicans have gone back to talking about God, taking the moral high ground against the "secular, evil left." Never mind illegal immigration, the trade policies which forfeit our national sovereignty.  Never mind America's loss of credibility and allies in the world.   My Republican party has abondoned its core principles espoused by Barry Goldwater, which focused on a smaller role for government,   national sovereignty, and fiscal responsibility.  Speaking as a Republican, it looks like my party is bound  and determined to stay the minority party forever, and to become a willing accompliss in putting Hillary in the White House. . 
 This book is horrible at treating the factor of history.  This is only a theological treatise about Christ's work of salvation.  If we look at the Bible (both in the Old Testament and the New Testament), historical context is important.  Prof. Morris should talk a little bit more about the Jewish guilt in killing Christ and what consequences that has.  Prof. Morris denies the whole prophetic tradition in ignoring this important element.  Thus, this book is neither wholly biblically-centered or beneficial to the long-term goals of the Christian church in light of the Word of God 
 Here, in all their glory, is REM: the undisputed Pied Pipers of the bedwetters.  While Michael Stipe's nasal delivery evoked all the comfort of a German Stuka dive-bomber, the whimpering and ludicrous lyrical content became a beacon-call to legions of self-absorbed suburban cry-babies everywhere.  In REM, we had a calculating and maudlin brood of cynical mountebanks who lounged in opulence while tormenting their naive minions with a decades-long barrage of unrestrained nonsense and pessimistic doomsaying.  The embarrassing spectacle probably hit its painful peak in 1992, but it obviously has left a cultural skid mark that will take years to eradicate.  This album is a one star stinker that might serve well as a gag gift 
 Meic Pearse is a traditionalist and a Christian.  He defines the "clash of civilizations" in terms that at their core relate to his belief in the moral and spiritual infallibility of the Bible.  Thus on pages 77-79 he defines human rights in terms of Biblical scripture, concluding that the sort of human right "that is claimed simply by virtue of one's existence" to be "not derived" from "Scripture" and therefore not something he is in agreement with.  We can see that Pearse IS in agreement with the Muslim belief that laws come from God and not from human beings themselves.  So it is not surprising to read this: "Normal people (that is, the rest of the world)...cannot exist without real meaning, without religion anchored in something deeper than existentialism and bland niceness, without a culture rooted deep in the soil of the place where they live." (p. 29)  Nicely expressed, but I wonder, do these "normal people" that exist outside the West--would that include humanists and agnostics, Buddhists and Hindus, Taoists and Zen Buddhists, Jains and Vedantists--indeed mainstream Christians, Jews and Muslims--or is he just referring to the subset of people who follow the fundamentalist expression of the Middle Eastern religions?  It is also not surprising that Pearse echoes the reaction of some fundamentalist clerics in the West. e.g., Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who declared after the World Trade center was hit by terrorists that essentially we had it coming.  This view is one that I find abhorrent because, while it does not exactly condone such murderous acts, it tries to shift the blame from the murderers themselves to aspects of the American culture that they--Pearse, Robertson, Falwell and others, along with the fundamentalist Muslims--find threatening to their world view.  In truth, Pearse's is a rearguard action against not just Hollywood and commercial America (the usual whipping boys), but against the basic tenets of democratic society.  We can see this in his statement that "human rights are essentially an invention of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment" whereas, "Traditional systems of morality worked on the principle of obligation: act this way; don't do that; you must; you shouldn't." (p. 64) Again he is in strong agreement with the traditionalist interpretations of the three Abrahamic religions.  My problem with those who worship "the Bronze Age God of battles," with those who find their authority in ancient texts and their behavioral guidance in tribalism, including intolerance of other points of view and the use of violence to resolve differences, is their utter irrelevance to, and ignorance of, the real issues the world faces today.  The fundamentalist interpreters of religion are Dark Age relics of a mentality that cannot possibly come to grips with the very real challenges of science, globalism and the postmodern world.  How a God that has a bad temper in whose image it is insisted that we were made, a God that apparently has a beard and an alimentary tract (what would he need that for?), a God that seems not to have any kind of grip on his world, but must resort to suicide bombings and tanks and guided missiles in order that His will be done--how can such a God of the tribe and superstition hope to cope with the 21st century?  Pearse seems to think that people who do not accept this God and his authority are atheists (he uses the term again and again to describe those in disagreement with his views) who hold values "not as an alternative to traditional values but as a negation of them--as anti-values, in fact." (p. 29)  This then is the problem.  It is not so much that Pearse is in disagreement with Western culture.  It is much worse than that.  What he perceives as Western culture he calls "an anticulture."  In other words, he and those who think like him have values and culture.  Those who disagree with his primitive view of religion, do not.  He sees only the culture of the mass media and the mass mind.  He doesn't seem to realize that people like David Hume and John Locke, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, existed, and he clearly turns his back on the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights in which men are declared to have inalienable rights.  In other words, Pearse would be a Christian fundamentalist Muslim--if such a creature existed, finding authority not in science or the Declaration of the Rights of Man, or in the cultural traditions coming out of the Enlightenment, but instead following only the authority of Scripture--which of course means following the authority of Scripture as interpreted by the clerics currently in power, as it had always been until the rise of the modern world.  Finally I don't think "they" hate us so much as Pearse likes to imagine.  The anti-Americanism that we see expressed today is largely a result of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq and the unilateralism of his attitude.  After all, it could be said that they "hate" us in Europe too.  America still has an enormous amount of good will in the world, and we are looked upon by hundreds of millions of people as the best hope for humankind and admired for our democratic way of life and our system of government with its checks and balances and its respect for individual human rights--something that authoritarian people like Pearse do not fully appreciate 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 In the beginning this book seemed to have potential. It told of the direct Msonic influence present in the foundation of the Untied States. This was the preface. Afterwards the book endlessly drags on, with dates, times,  people, and places; everything except what I expected; a testimony of how  Freemasonry affected the establishment of the USA. If you are interested in  reading a book that reads like a high school text book, but really goes no  deeper, if you are interested in when but not why, maybe you will enjoy.  But I doubt it 
 if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.  liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.  sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.  repeat for 300 pages...   "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it 
 may god have mercy upon this poor excuse for a mans sou 
 This is an astonishingly lame, poorly written and shoddily researched book. I've read a number of books about the iLife software, and this book is a rehash of Apple's Help files and product announcements, with the quotation marks filed off. Do yourself a favor and look at Pogue's individual books for each app, or Teach Yourself Visually iLife '04 for a basic intro. Avoid this one--it reeks 
 The story didn't seem believable..the editing was questionable and I just didn't care for it. I expected much more, I can't recommend it 
 The other 1-star reviews are very accurate. For people who are attracted to this "Centering Prayer" please read books about "Lectio Divina". "Lectio Divina" is a true Catholic Christian tradition.  The Bible warns about falling into traps such as "Centering Prayer". The objective of Centering Prayer is a closeness to God. How can we get close to God without "works". We must love God with our whole mind, might, body, ACTIONS, intentions. We obtain salvation through Christ. It is the Christian objective to become like Christ - in the way we live.  We must do the corporal and spiritual acts of Mercy. "As you treat the least among you is how you treat me (Jesus)". Feed the poor, visit the sick, counsel the afflicted, admonish sinners, clothe the naked, ect 
 Boring book.  I returned it.  There was nothing in this book that inspired me to knit.  I was expecting cute, unusual, colorful sweaters for adults similar to her childrens patterns.  No such luck.  If you have one or two books of basic adult sweater patterns you don't need this one 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 Save yourself time and aggravation and DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought this to put home movies on DVD. Almost every time I downloaded a home movie to my computer the audio was not in sync with the video. I spent hours trying to get it right. I also kept upgrading my computer thinking that was the problem. I finally saw a review here explaining that the PX-M402U is notorious for this problem, so I bought a CANOPUS ADVC110 and have not had a single problem! 
 I have to agree that it can be condensed a lot....  He comes off as all knowing and we should listen to his every word. Real estate is where to put the money, well my IMHO I think the housing market is about to crash, so does Greenspan, why do you think he's getting out while he can.  I bought the book used, for the one or two nuggets it's ok.  Ok, prepare for the crash that everyone knows is coming anyway, and with Katrina, Rita and Iraq you don't need to be a prophet. CASH, GOLD, I recommend, not property, free, enjoy 
 Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a secret service agent who is guarding the President of the United States. He is assassinated on Cuba's watch. Of course, he's consumed with guilt. A Pulitzer Prize winning reporter is trying to uncover what really happened and gets Cuba involved.  Sounds like it should be fascinating, doesn't it? It was dreadfully boring. Don't waste your time on this dud.  
 I know this is supposed to be a "cute" movie, but it is such a tired subject. It is "BIG" all over again....Granted, Jennifer Garner is much easier to look at than Tom Hanks....At least from this Male reviewers perspective. Garner is capable of SO MUCH more than this (Daredevil, Elektra). Garner is still good, as is Rufalo, and the film is good for what is supposed to be, it just falls a little flat due to it's re-tread subject matter. Still worth the $2 rental.....but not the late fees. 2 Stars 
 I got this book hoping it would be helpful. It was very heavy on the side of psychology, which is of very little help in parenting or life. If a reader feels the field of psychology is worth while, they will probably find this book to be of use. While there were some good points they were few and far between. While readers of books can eat the meat and spit out the bones, this was something like trying to eat tilapia 
  	The author of A Northern Light is Jennifer Donnelly.  She resides in Brooklyn, N.Y, with her husband and daughter as well as two greyhounds.  Other works by  the author  include Humble Pie and The Tea Rose.  A Northern Light was the winner of The Carnegie Medal, The Los Angeles Times Prize and A Michael L. Printz Award Honor Book.   	The intended purpose of this book was to address many issues that young people face growing up.  The main character, Mattie Gokey, has to go through many hardships and make many adult decisions in this novel.  Mattie lives with her Pa and younger sisters.  Other characters that play a large role in this book are Weaver, Royal, Minnie, Miss Wilcox and Grace Brown.  A murder takes place in this book that was based upon real events.  Even though the murder was an actual event, the characters are made up to help it come clearer to readers.  Grace Brown's body is found in the lake after she takes a boat ride.   She gives Mattie a bundle of letters to burn but when she is found dead, instead of burning them, Mattie begins to read them and discovers many important aspects of the murder.  Donnelly skips back and forth from past to present and takes us through part of Mattie's life.  She also adds alot of advanced vocabulary for Mattie's words of the day.  She also uses language of the time period to make the story  come to life better.   	Although this novel received many awards of excellence and I'm sure alot of people would greatly enjoy  reading it, I was not one of them.  At the beginning, I thought it was going to be a very exciting murder mystery, but was disappointed to discover that the murder played only a small part in the whole novel.  I did find it very interesting though that it was actually based on a real murder.  I would probably not recommend this book for someone who is looking for a murder mystery because the murder only plays a small part in the novel.  Also, I think the author could have labeled the chapters a little more clearly because it got a little confusing with all the switching back and forth between past and present.   	I would say the intended audience would be young adults and most likely just females.  It contained some adult content, such as some profanity, as well as some sexual content.  Boys would probably not enjoy this novel because it is, in some aspects, a love story.  There's "sparking" and affairs and dirty older men at the hotel.  A younger person would not understand or want to read something that involves such material.   	In conclusion, A Northern Light was not one of my  favorite books that I've ever read.  The audience range is very  small and also based upon gender.  It is a well written novel, it just doesn't spark alot of interest in many people.  It went into to much detail at some parts and not enough for other parts.  I think she should have made the murder a more important part of the novel because it would have made it much more exciting.  
 Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 Much worse than previous McAfee editions.  I dropped Norton on some older desktops due to its lack of support for W2000. I then went to the free edition of AVG anti-virus, which was OK but slowed things down. Thinking "you get what you pay for" I sprung for McAfee which has been OK in the past. The edition I purchased has 3 licenses.  I installed one of these on my wife's XP laptop as well as one of my desktops (luckily, she's still talking to me).  The 2007 McAfee Suite makes AVG look like a free Ferrari. Absolutely terrible performance, coupled with a mediocre interface. Perhaps the only poorer-performing way to assure you'll never get a virus, spam, etc. would be to hit your motherboard with a hammer.  This will slow down your computer (even worse, unpredictably). If you have lots of email in Outlook or Outlook Express expect to open your mail box, then have a long break before you can do a thing (as it rechecks everything for spam). There's a partial workaround for this, but users shouldn't have to search for workarounds. Every Web action now has noticeable latency -- as well as slower applications when McAfee is grinding away in the background.  If you liked your current anti-spam, kiss it goodbye -- McAfee may not let you keep it. McAfee (like Norton) is also difficult to remove from your system. What prompted this review? Today it appears the update process rebooted my computer without requiring a "yes" from me.  As for alternatives, I wasn't able to get Kaspersky anti-virus to run on an older machine -- somewhare a remnant of Norton persisted (possibly a document tagged Symantec etc. left over from a day of working with them ages ago). However, I did get it running on a laptop and its better than Norton-McAfee-and even AVG in my opinion.  So, consider Kaspersky or another vendor. If that doesn't work try AVG.   It will be interesting to see how McAfee responds -- they've really shot themselves in the foot with this release 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs 
 I have wanted to read this book since I first heard of it. A timely Christmas present solved the first part of the problem; I eagerly jumped in immediately. And found many many problems.  The book is badly organized, repetitive, tedious, cliche riddled, prone to tarring with very broad brushes, and outrageously oversimplified. In fact, the book tells a great story in a terribly flawed way, much as the history books she reviews do. But she has no one to blame but herself. I could list many examples, but some of the other reviewers have done a good job on that. Let me just tackle one.  When knocking the attacks that originate on the "right", she lumps all manner of wildly divergent groups together. Names are strung together as if they all believe the same things, seek the same limitations, oppose the same passages. The "right" is a block of thinkers all trying to squelch evolution (which she blithely dismisses), ugliness, Satanism, secular humanism, on an on, blah blah blah. She never addresses whether the objections of some might be more valid than others. Whether the virulent anti-Christianity she so properly complains about later in the book might not be worth questioning and opposing  No, she knows the perfect answer to every problem, she knows the proper amount of negotiation required, she arrogantly can determine just where the proper "middle" path is.  Just as the windbag authors she excoriates know. It is hard to keep your voice out of the discussion when you feel passionately.  A limitation I didn't see mentioned elsewhere is pedagogical. The kind of teaching she imagines cannot happen in high school. Read two textbooks? As a former teacher, if I could have gotten my students to read one book I would have been thrilled. But two different books describing the same facts? In a single year? With students three to five years below reading level? Whoa...not in 50 minutes a day, lady. Not happening 
 Stories are well crafted, but the subject matter didn't interest me. Not bad, but I wouldn't buy it again 
 "You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing" is what he said. Hiroshima Mon Amour depicts the reality of the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place on August 6, 1945.  The story begins with two bodies against each other with multiple clips of the results of the bombing.  When I watched this movie for the first time, I realized this movie was far from a fairy tale.  Instead, this movie captured reality and could be described as the "fiction" aspect of history William Gass explains in "The Nature of Narrative".  Throughout the entire movie the main character, a woman from France explains the hardships she went through back at home.  It was disturbing for me to watch the movie as it went back in time where she was taunted for have been in love with a German soldier.  I felt it violated a person's right as to whom he/she may date.  It was also unbearable to watch the clips where it shows the end results after the bombing of Hiroshima.  The fact that this movie was made in 1959 the black and white picture made it difficult for me to read the subtitles.  Lastly, the one thing I must question about this movie is the fact that it was told in French.  I couldn't help but get frustrated that the movie started from an awkward stage of the overall story.  It seems as though it skipped the introduction and went straight into the rising of the climax.  I didn't like that they both speak of the war with no clear explanation as to what they're really talking about.  If a person who was completely oblivious about the history of Hiroshima were to watch this movie, he/she that's watching would have a hard time comprehending the overall point of the movie.  
 Like so many others, this movie struck a raw nerve with me regarding the graphic detail that was enacted by then 12 year old Jena Malone.  Although the movie has a point to make about child abuse and sexual abuse, I, as the mother of a 13 year old, can not understand how another mother could stand by and watch her child being filmed in such graphic detail.  I could not watch the whole movie as the car scene was so disturbing I turned it off.  What is the difference between a child being molested, and a child actor who is sitting in the lap of a grown man?  Why are the laws different for Jena?  Yes, these types of movies have a point to make, but sacrificing the innocence of another child is not the way to do it 
 The book is a total disappointment and shouldn't even be sold by Amazon.  It is vague, rambles, doesn't have good examples or instructions. I'm judging it by comparing it with "Photoshop for Dummies" by a different author which is nicely done.  I've never seen a worse book in the ...for Dummies series. I wish I could get my money back 
 I debated whether or not I should write a review.  After all, I only read the first 70 pages or so, after which I decided to stop slogging through this tedious novel.  However, since I assume most people who would buy and read this book are doing it for their own enjoyment, I felt complelled to chime in, although I'm clearly in the minority.  However, I must add in my defense that this book was initially criticized by his contemporaries as a short story that just kept rambling on with no apparent purpose, a criticism I find valid.  The premise sounds fascinating - the journey of a young seaman who attempts to reconcile his dishonorable past.  It sounded like it would be an interesting tale about the conflict between heroics and harsh reality.  However, in the delivery of the story, I lost all interest shortly.  The main problem I see is in the vivid descriptions and imagery.  This, or course, is usually a good thing.  However, Conrad seems to go into such great description of every little detail that it distracts from the main story.  It seems that Conrad could have been just as effective by using half of the words.  The non-sequitur narrative also makes it a bit more difficult to follow, although I think this could have been effective if the narrative would have been more concise and to the point.  However, rather than merely blasting away at "Lord Jim," I will at least give one alternative - "Heart of Darkness", also by Joseph Conrad.  Read my take of this in my other reviews.  This is a much more interesting and more enjoyable read than "Lord Jim", and about half its length.  Plus, it offers a more poignant picture of Imperialism and its ideals (or lack thereof).  Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, but until then I would recommend you give "Lord Jim" a pass and spend your money and time on another novel, perhaps "Heart of Darkness. 
 Spacey's character moons the press near the start of the movie.  However, the moon was hairless and curvy.  In "American Beauty," Spacey showed that he has a nice posterior, but it was hairy and a bit flat.  Like Kevin Costner and Val Kilmer, Spacey must have added to the list of Hollywood actors who wimp out of nudity.  He is not as brave as Harvey Keitel, Ewan McGregor, or Jude Law.  What a shame coming from a man who is usually so edgy in his work 
 I wasn't impressed with this book. It seemed to be written from a denominational view. It wasn't just telling what the scripture says but had too much personal opinion. I wouldn't buy from the author again 
 I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated 
 The characters are so dull. The acting is mediocre and the theme is so predictable that I would prefer to watch HOmer Simpson 
 there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable "crash", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst "mainstream" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek 
 I wish this would have a little more back bone. Maybe I just like longer movies. If it were a little more meaty with a little longer plot it would have been a great movie. Instead it leaves you hanging and saying what 
 Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective.  He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance.  Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about.  For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog.  It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless.  This book is not truly bad.  It is just simply odd.  If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy.  Othewise, it is worth a pass 
 This is a lovely book with great pictures.  I don't mind a book about being different but this one is clearly about more than that.  It was not a message I was happy giving my four year old 
 This is a required book for an introductory lighting class I'm taking.  Since we are solely relying on this book and it isn't supplemented with lecture material, I find that, without familiarity with lighting terminology and concepts, it is very difficult to understand -- very cryptic with the seemingly overused language of the field.  While the author may be very knowledgeable, I feel the book is not very well written and the target audience is, perhaps, not intended to be, essentially, the layman.  I don't find the organization of ideas and concepts to be clearly laid out or communicated well and, as they unfold, and I come to understand what the author is trying to say,  wonder why it was made so difficult -- is that all he means, geesh and why didn't he tell me that earlier.  It would be easier to understand the general concept of things first, even in plain English perhaps, and then go on to a more technical description to learn the language of the field and get the details.  Just seems to make simple things very complicated, especially with the language, flow of ideas, and phrasing.    I also find a lot of the graphic figures and photo examples need some clarification or more details.  A picture's supposed to be worth a thousand words, not be cryptic and time-consuming to understand.    Sorry, I would not recommend this for students who are not primed first.  Especially the younger ones.    
 I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing.  What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter 
 There are really two, very parallel, stories told in this book, and they are only separated by a couple of million years. In the present, a young teenager named Vinny has convinced her mother to let her spend summer vacation with her father in Africa. Her father, Sam, is working in an archeological site in Africa without much success. Vinny turns out to be his good luck charm. Flip back to the past and we see a teenager called Li that is half-ape, half-human that thinks way beyond her time. Each chapter goes back and forth between past and present. A couple of times I was lost in the paleontology talk and the present storyline was a bit boring, but I liked the author's way of describing the past storyline 
 I really enjoyed these girls. Though I think they are better off with a major label. YOU'VE REALLY GOT SOMETHING and I FOUND LOVE are the only songs that I liked from this album. Hopefully these ladies will get picked up by a major record label.....it will most definitely be a win win situation 
 This movie is a bit new fantasy. They go waaayy beyond reinventing a story. Still... Garbo does a nice acting job. Too bad they didn't thought it would be neccisary to dy her hair black like Mata Hari was in real life.   The movie is still a good classic... but don't take it as history.   Mata Hari... the Legend [... 
 This is my fault im writing this!! I read the reviews for this film before i watched it, and i had seen the tralier but being such a huge fan of Blade 1,2,3 and all his other movies i thought they cant be true!!!!!!    ......how wronge i was:( Theres no need to go all into it, its been done before. Its just bad,so so so bad!! 
 I didn't find this book helpful, and here's why:  My 10 year old daughter tends to over eat and crave unhealthy foods, so I'm working on educating her on nutrition and keeping her active.  I thought this book looked like a good resources, but the problem is that it looks like a young child's book, even though it contains good information in the second half, appropriate to an older child.  So, my 10 year old took one look at it, declared it a 'baby's book' (because the cover and art and first pages look like it's designed for a very young child), and I couldn't get her further in it, because she prides herself on now being able to read 'big kid' (chapter type) books.  The packaging/art approach just don't match the level of the content 
 I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.  Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do? 
 This is what happened to me - I was embarrassed for myself. This is probably one of the worst crime films ever made - profoundly poor acting, terrible script, a soundtrack that is too awful for words. And William L. Peterson is such a detestably unsexy little man - he spends the entire movie swaggering around in a pair of tight jeans with mannerisms so studied it plays like comedy. There is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever - unless of course you want to laugh at how ridiculously dated it all is. 
 This book is bad stuff because it doesn't emphasize eternal damnation in Hell.  Without Hell and eternal damnation, God did not have to take on human flesh to die in a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.  John Stott really needs to read his Bible carefully.  How could someone who doesn't understand this be saved? 
 ORIGINAL INTENT represents a more polished version of David Barton's usual arguments: some of the Founding Fathers said things that might lead people to believe that they were devoutly religious at some point in their lives, so it must be true that they didn't really believe in the separation of state and church.  If one looks deeply into the quotes Barton uses, one finds that they are often taken from dissenting opinions in Supreme Court cases, contemoraries of the signers of the Constitution who weren't invited to the Constitutional Convention because they were anti-federalist, non-signers of the Constitution who WERE present at the convention, and, in one specific case, Noah Webster AFTER his profound conversion in the early 19th century.    Although David Barton says he uses 1400 footnotes, they are actually endnotes, as one reviewer noted.  The two reviewers who made a big deal about the number of cited sources should realize that quantity means nothing, especially if one may produce an equal or greater quantity of dissenting quotes.  Another way Barton misdirects is in his use of captialization of the word "court".  If it is capitalized, it means the Supreme Court, but otherwise, it's a lower court.  It would not be misleading if it were not for the fact that he will use "Court" in one sentence and "court" in the very next, leading the unwary reader to believe that the Supreme Court had a certain opinion that a lower court actually made.  I want to go back to dissenting opinions for a moment: Barton often uses the opinions of dissenters as the opinion of the Supreme Court or a lower court, when, in fact, the dissenter was, by definition, in the minority, and the ruling made was just the opposite of his opinion.  Also, dissenters often used their written court opinions as an opportunity to get on a soapbox about personal beliefs--and Barton uses quotes of this kind extensively.  Barton makes a huge deal about going straight to the source for quotes, but makes extensive use of secondhand sources for his information.  He will often use a quote of a quote that came from a sermon where a minister misquoted a Founder.  He will also use quotes from well before the Constitutional Convention, and any student of history will be aware that the government was much less centralized under the Articles of Confederation.  I have undertaken the task of tracking down the orginal sources of Barton's quotes, and the scores I've done so far demonstrate to me that they often amount to less than credible evidence that the Founders wanted a Christian nation.  For example, Barton quotes Madison (this quote may only be in Myth of Separation, where the same arguments are made in less detail), but, in an insult to the intelligence of his readers, or in an act of plain negligence, he ignores the context of the quote, which makes it clear that his comment was tongue-in-cheek.  Madison begins a reply to a religious man with "Christianity is the greatest religion in the world," then goes one to talk about how a Jewish person, a Muslim (mohametan), an atheist and other non-christians would find being taxed for religious purposes repugnant.  In the same letter from which Barton derives this quote, Madison is actually pushing for separation of state and church!  Barton is right: "separation of church and state" is not in the Constitution, but he is wrong to say that only Jefferson believed in the concept and its correlation to the Establishment Clause, and he is horribly mistaken when he says that the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply the Establishment Clause to the States.  When he goes into this argument, he conveniently neglects to quote the Fourteenth Amendment--though, embarrassingly for him, he has the Constitution in the back of the book for anyone to read.  I'm betting he's counting on his readers not to bother.  Barton makes his living off of telling Christians who want theocracy exactly what they want to hear.  He tells his readers that his god told him to write his books, and guided him to look at such-and-such a statistic or quote, but if this is true, his god is directing him to lie and misdirect.  In another of his books, AMERICA: TO PRAY OR NOT TO PRAY, he says his god told him to look at SAT scores--but he is VERY selective about the portion of the SAT's history from which he graphs the scores--with good reason.  The decade immediately before the one with which he starts gives lie to his claim that SAT scores dropped as a direct result of prayer being removed from schools.  There was a drop that was equally significant just before the one he notes 
 I kept reading the book, hoping to find one of the stories that really would have a profound impact on me. It just didn't "happen" for me. Most of the stories have very predictible outcomes 
 I noticed that one of the authors of this book has taken time out of his (I am sure) busy schedule to haunt the Amazon customer reviews for the apparent purpose of quibbling with detractors.  In order to avoid falling prey to this tactic, I feel the need to clarify a few things before expressing my opinion.  To wit:  I was born in the same year as Vatican II.  I grew up in a very liberal (liturgically speaking) diocese.  I have no memory of the Latin mass.  I grew up with altar girls, folk masses, and the songs of the St. Louis Jesuits, and that's fine with me.   I see Holy Communion received in the hand and Mass in the vernacular as part of a "back to basics" movement in the church, not as suspect innovations.  In short, I do not fit the stereotype  with which the aforementioned gentleman would seem to like to dismiss those who have objected  to his book.    Now that that's off my chest, I can address the matter at hand.  I'm afraid this review is rather long,  because I actually read the whole book and am trying to cover it thoroughly.   To its credit, the book is generally friendly and disarming in tone, particularly if the reader is one of those non-Catholics  who regard the Church with suspicion.  It does cover pretty much all the basic tenets of Catholicism, includes brief biogs of a number of saints and several popes, and outlines the main traditions and practices of the Church understandably.  To its detriment, the book spends far and away too many pages on matters the authors seem to consider fundamental to Catholicism that actually have little to do with Catholicism or religion in general.  A recurrent theme is that of "ethnic" or "tribal" Catholicism, and many of the experiences and perspectives put in the book by the authors are particular more to a certain Catholic demographic than to the Church at large. Not having grown up in the immediate pre-Vatican II period in an ethnic neighborhood in the urban Northeast, I really can't relate.   Neither, I suspect, could the average post-Vat. II Catholic,  Southern Catholic,  Hispanic Catholic, foreign-born Catholic, or recent convert.  Catholicism is about a relationship with God through Christ.  Much  described in this book is tangential  but not essential.  Most of it didn't really need to be covered in this book, either:  that has been done (literally to death) in a large assortment of books, plays and movies.     One demographic that  was shorted in this book was the non-Romans.  While the Roman rite is the largest and best-known Catholic church, the fact that the Catholic Church includes a number of smaller Eastern Rite churches barely got a mention.  This is a shame as the reader would never have a clue that different liturgical traditions (besides some fringe New Agers) flourish under the "One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic" mantle.    It is in the sections on social teaching and sexuality that this book really gets on shaky footing.  The authors' personal biases were not difficult to spot.  Repeatedly, when treating a subject of which they favored the Church's view (i.e. capital punishment) or just a subject with conclusions they favored (i. e. liberation theology) the authors were very positive and glossed over any controversy or objections to their position.  Likewise, when treating subject matter on which they seemed to have fundamental disagreements with established Church doctrine (i. e. almost anything having to do with sex, or abortion) they tended to pile on the "nuances" to the Church's position or dismiss it altogether.  Reading this book, one would never guess that there is as much (if not more) controversy among practicing Catholics with respect to the death penalty as there is with respect to abortion.  (Sorry, pal, you lose the bet.  I'm pretty much Seamless Garment.) These sections of the book and the final addendum on the clerical abuse scandal, moreover, relied rather heavily on opinion, speculation, and pop philosophy as far as I could see.  I'd certainly like to see some documentation for the assertion that "there is no clear scientific agreement to determine when life begins."  My  background is in biology and that is balderdash.  Finally, I'll reiterate briefly a couple of objections raised by previous reviewers.  First, it is true that the book got genuflection wrong.  We genuflect before the tabernacle to acknowledge the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.  In churches in which the tabernacle is kept in a separate chapel, we do not genuflect before the altar.  We may, at our option, bow.  Second, including Madonna in the section on well-known Catholics was a waste of paper.  Madonna may be an ethnic Catholic, but as far as I can tell hasn't practiced either in ritual or in spirit in years.  Though she employed the trappings of Catholicism in her act,  it was just trappings and it was hardly done in a repectful way.  As her spiritual journey has in recent years taken her to a New Age subset of Judaism, moreover, it's a bit presumptuous to keep trying to tag her with the Catholic brand.   It appears to me that the most gracious thing the authors could have done when presented with glaring evidence of their own error would be to muster a cheerful "My bad.  We'll definitely fix that in the next edition."  Instead, at least one of them seems to have opted for name-calling.  
 Very disappointing.  I only bought it because I found Ringo's 4-volume "trilogy" on the Posleen wars engaging with interesting characters.   This book does not measure up. It starts with lots of clunky expository dialogue, then goes on to a tedious, way too long set up. After 164 pages, after you've followed the tiresomely cliched characters around for a lot of totally irrelevant and uninteresting non-events, when you're wondering for the tenth time if the story is ever going to start and which of these cardboard cut-outs you're supposed to care about (you never come to care about any of them) there's a betrayal (finally, some action!) for what turns out to be a totally uninteresting motive, followed by a long tedious stalk (here we go again) and frustrating out of character behavior of the survivors: A master sniper can't find a wounded guy who's crawled a few meters into the bush? Doesn't even try? When he obviously needs to leave no one alive?  And where was the Darhel's vaunted "Sense" while the murder was being planned? Then we're told Darhel can go a week sans rest without too much trouble but he's so worn out after three days he can't take the opportunity of the bad guy falling asleep to move? He exposes himself to fire to begin some great plan then two pages later is again wondering what to do next?   Don't hold your breath waiting for him to do anything to justify the book's title.  You'll be horribly disappointed. Then we find jarring contradictory details like "the hero" still being tracked several pages after he's discovered and ditched the tracking device. etc. etc. etc... The final fate of the bad guy is straight "god out of the box". Come on! I won't reveal what it was in case some masochist wants to slog through the long tedium for it but it made me want to hurl the book across the room. Or just hurl.  And the denoument is laughable.  Think of the old "Kung Fu" TV serious.  "Well done, grasshopper...." My bet is Ringo had very minority input on this.   Note to Baen: Crap is crap no matter whose name is on it 
 Such great visuals and I love most of the Star Wars RPG/Shooters, BUT, I cant believe this is a point and click game.  I was hoping KOTOR2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement.  Theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around, click the target, then engage someone else after the kill.  The days of Boulder's Gate point-n-click should be over, but I guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay.  Still a good game, but dissapointed 
 While I am a huge fan of Piers Anthony, I not only found this book very "put down-able" but offensive.  Between the gratuitous sex on every page and the consumption of human body parts as aphrodesiacs, there  was very little good story.  The history parts were very good and read  well, but the story part of the book was a definite turn-off for me and  several of my friends.  I'd stick to the other Anthony series for better  entertainment 
 "A SCIENTIFIC revolution, according to Kuhn [the scientist/linguist author of THE THEORY OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS], is not simply an addition to pre-existing knowledge. It is, within any field, 'a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals'; a complete demolition of an old theoretical and conceptual structure and its replacement by a new one based on entirely different aims and premises. The old paradigm...attacked from the outside...cannot be defeated on the basis of its own rules for, as we have seen...these rules are not only inadequate to solve new problems which have begun to arise--THEY ACTUALLY PRECLUDE ANY DISCUSSION OF THESE PROBLEMS AT ALL."  Dr. Chris Knight, London From BLOOD RELATIONS: MENSTRUATION AND THE ORIGINS OF CULTURE  "Unable to detect any contradiction in the formal statements of the Ancients after an objective confrontation with total Egyptian reality, and consequently unable to disprove them, they either give them the silent treatment or reject them dogmatically and indignantly. They express regret that people as normal as the ancient Egyptians could have made so grievous an error and thus create so many difficulties and delicate problems for modern specialists. Next they try in vain to find a White origin for Egyptian civilization. They finally become mired down in their own contradictions...after performing intellectual acrobatics as learned as they are unwarranted. They then repeat the initial dogma...the White origin of Egyptian civilization.  "...Egyptians themselves--who should surely be better qualified than anyone to speak of their origin--recognize without ambiguity that their ancestors came from Nubia and the heart of Africa."  Chek Anta Diop THE AFRICAN ORIGIN OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION From Chapter Three, "Modern Falsification of History" and Chapter Seven, "Arguments for a Negro Origin"  This seemingly balanced look at the psycho-cultural history of Afrocentricity still shares with its more latently racist precursors one undeniable fact, when looking at history through the lens of science: they are all eerily reminiscent of the Biblical scholars and human biology scientists who brutally attacked Darwin in the mid 19th century, and the Newtonian physicists who joyfully and artfully dismissed the work of the postal clerk Einstein in the beginning of the 20th.  Dare to compare...and see if I'm right.  Compare this book to Chek Anta Diop's THE AFRICAN ORIGIN OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION, the archetypal lightning rod for Eurocentric criticism. Walker in HOME AGAIN clearly puts the underqualified "Amen" chorus of Afrocentricity on notice. However, this still does nothing to Diop, regarding the scientific basis of his work and the paradigmatic shift away from the corrupted integrity of Classicism it instigates.   Consider the following:  =Does Walker believe an "absence of evidence" (i.e. an absence of scholarly work on ancient African comparative linguistics that fortifies a preexisting Afrocentric theory about Egyptian/African cultures) "equals the evidence of absence" (i.e. equals proof that the post-Egyptian African cultures were not "racially" derivative of the more ancient African cultures of the Nile Valley [in the way the similarities of the ancient Greek, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French languages show their "Indo-European" origins])?  And does he believe secretly relying on THAT childish postulate to disprove an "African" influence on "Indo-European" cultures via Egypt is somehow good enough science, freeing him to talk about sociology and politics?   =How is it, really, that there are no comparative linguistics studies of the sub-Saharan African languages and Coptic, Demotic, or the most ancient Egyptian written in hieroglyphs for Walker to refer to (as Egypt is, geographically, a northeast African country)? Do they really not exist at all, or do they simply not support his point of view, therefore undermining the credibility of his thesis?  censorship    =Why are the startling similarities (to say the least) of the Greek mythological pantheon and the older Egyptian systematically ignored in both Biblical and ancient literature studies within the Classicist's paradigm? (Like, for example, the names Athena and Athens ["Athene"] proven to be derived from the Egyptian goddess Neith ["Nth"], the sophisticated worship of whom predates Greece as a culture by more than two thousand years?)   =What are Walker's credentials in archaeology, anthropology, linguistics or the applied physical sciences?   demagogue  And why is it that his fan base in predominantly sociological academia (and of course, reactionary American politics) sees no reason to even ASK this question?  Only Diop's work truly answers these questions, revealing their unavoidable implications.  Diop breaks AFRICAN ORIGIN into the following chapters:  I- Preface: The Meaning of our Work  1) What were the Egyptians? 2) Birth of the Negro Myth 3) Modern Falsification of History 4) Could Egyptian Civilization have originated in the Delta? 5) Could Egyptian Civilization Be of Asian Origin? 6) The Egyptian Race as Seen and Treated by Anthropologists 7) Arguments Supporting a Negro Origin 8) Arguments Opposing a Negro Origin 9) Peopling of Africa from the Nile Valley 10) Political and Social Evolution of Ancient Egypt 11) Contribution of Ethiopian-Nubia and Egypt 12) Reply to a Critic 13) Early History of Humanity: Evolution of the Black World  II- Conclusion  The paradigm-shifting, scientific foundation of Afrocentricity is, in part, instituting a Freudian projection/transference from the intellectual institutions of Euro-American, Imperialist/Plantation-era capitalism: that which is the economic foundation of the modern "globalized" world. This is for which almost the entirety of Classicism is but an apologetic (as it was essentially designed to be); much like *craniometry* also was for the American Slavery and Jim Crow centuries that accompanied it (a "science" often equally heralded by 19th and early 20th century racist intellectuals before being discredited in this oh so pure academic world of ours). The evidence of this dynamic is, partly, the irrational celebration of underanalysed books like this. Galileos of ancient history, like the 19th century pre-Jungian mythographer Gerald Massey (ANCIENT EGYPT, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD; BOOK OF BEGINNINGS) and the 20th century African physicist/linguist Diop are said to herald a paradoxical return to Nazism (?), where non-scientific political essays like Walker's book are celebrated as the Gospel. WE CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN is Aryan theology masquerading as African-American historiography, masquerading as science.   
 This insight into TV journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent's vacation to Florida. O'Reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction (or a work of anything, for that matter).  And his main character: Tommy O'Malley (wasn't he one of the Aristocats?) About as dull and dumb as a bag of hammers (which someone ought to whack O'Reilly in the groin with). To sum up in a forthright, no-spin manner: this book sucks. I should have seen it coming, when my bid for eight dollars on Ebay was the only bid for five days, and turned out to be the winning bid (though, "winning" is hardly the term I'd use after listening to this piece of garbage). Since O'Reilly's a fan of torture, he ought to donate this audio CD for use in interrogating prisoners, if the Geneva Convention will allow it 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 I had happily used a Oster/Sunbeam wall mount dryer for several years.  When it died, I tried to save a few dollars buying the Jerdon 1600W, partly because I thought it was made by Sunbeam.  It arrived with the rear filter already broken, and it seems less well made than the old Oster.  Amazon was great about refunding my money quickly, and I have been happy again with the new version of Oster/Sunbeam, which has two speeds and two wattage settings.  A wall dryer is a great convenience, but only if you buy a product which is reliable 
 were not in stock, order cancelled, no other info. has been received regarding item 
 I bought this book excited by the premise and found it to be a sad disappointment. Populated with gross stereotypes, misrepresentative of the Faith, and full of poorly-constructed two-dimensional characters made colorful by circumstance rather than spirit, Rinaldi takes a beautiful piece of Church Lore and turns it into a relativistic anti-Catholic romp. Propaganda at its worst.  Irredeemably convoluted if not downright hateful 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 You really don't need this book.  Yes, there may be a few interesting ideas here and there but perhaps, it would be suffice to have a list of 50 to get you started thinking how to pamper yourself and then you can think of better ways yourself.  Okay, if you need some excuses (like "oh, the book said it will be good if I pamper myself this way"), go get the book.  Otherwise, save the money and buy yourself a real treat 
 To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.This movie is produced in New York. The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.The situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.For the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed  by that time. So there is where Dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous. He gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.In addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera. Thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing. He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.The characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.THe way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear  women's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent. Because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work. The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.The lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated. The costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.Furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting, there were not that much music but it was ok. This movie could be reall in life because  sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job. I will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life. 
 Gary Demar's dumbed down book says every thing occured in 70 A.D. Demar claims that Matthew 24 word for word describes everything that was to happen and come "shortly to pass" in the book of Revelation. Also the confused preterist like to say that Revelation is a past event because it says shortly to pass and Daniel says for many days but what DUMBMAR FORGETS IS THAT THEY BOTH SPEAK OF THE RESURRECTION SO BASED ON THAT THE RESURRECTION OCCURED IN 70 A.D. SATAN ON ALL UNBELIEVERS SHOULD BE IN THE LAKE OF FIRE NEW JERUSALEM SHOULD BE ON EARTH RIGHT NOW AND NOW. ETC. ASK YOURSELF THESE QUESTIONS WHAT ABOUT REV.21:4 REV.21:22 REV.22:5 I COULD GO ON AND ON.!!!!!!So based on this strict logic everything occured in 70 A.D. Yet the insane preterist do not seem to apply strict interpertation of Revelation 20:7 you can not have it both ways.  Also he claims that Nero was the Beast and 666 was a spiritual number this is obviously not true.  If he knew his bible he would know that one of the judgements of wrath would be sores on anyone who recieves the mark of the Beast. REV.16:2!!!!!!!! Dosent sound spiritual to me!!!!!! Nowhere do you find any body saying that Nero and the false prophet were cast alive into the lake of fire Rev. 19:20 Not only that but if Jesus did return in 70 A.D. then WE SHOULD BE IN ETERNITY NOW BECAUSE 70 A.D. WAS ALMOST TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO!!!!!!!!  OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT THE CASE!!!!!!!!! 
 As a stand-alone story (not a "prequel"), this book is relatively fun - if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos. I can't believe this made it past editing!   As far as being a prequel to Barrie's Peter Pan, this book misses the mark. There are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower "re-telling" of Barrie's richly woven classic. These are not the characters we knew and loved; this is not the Never Land we dreamed about at night. Pixie dust is now nothing more than "space dust" which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact. Need I say more 
 I have done historical research on former USAF installations as a hobby for many years. A friend sent me this book a long time ago. I found it to be disjointed and poorly written with facts presented by Preston Nichols that are contrary to historical fact and common sense.  During the times that he claims that strange Philadelphia Experiment-type activities were being undertaken at Montauk Air Force Station, it was a functioning air defense radar site with more than 100 Air Force people and their families living at the base. Less than a mile away was the Montauk Lighthouse, attracting thousands of visitors every year, every one whom drove past the Air Force station to get to the lighthouse.   There is nothing remarkable about Montauk Air Force Station today except that the radar sail is still there and that the State of New York is trying to preserve it. The site is a park and is open to the public, Camp Hero State Park. The AN/FPS-35 radar tower and antenna--the sail--were put on the National Register of Historic Places in June 2002.   Nichols claims that the base closed in the 1970s but secret, mysterious activity continued. In reality the scheduled late 1970s closure was delayed until the early 1980s because of a delay in putting a replacement radar in service at nearby Riverhead.   He writes about hearing a mysterious radio signal that led him to Montauk AFS. If he was hearing anything, it was a Coast Guard-operated radio navigation transmitter next to the base. Its transmissions used to overpower car radios in the immediate area.    Montauk AFS was located on the site of a World War II Coast Artillery post, Camp Hero. Camp Hero had two 16-inch guns that required a very large concrete infrastructure that was buried, except for the gun ports, as camouflage. These massive structures are still in place and according to Nichols they are merely the small surface part of a massive underground base at Montauk. He is wrong, again.  Here is a summary of how the base was utilized since 1948. These are simple facts. Compare them with what Preston B. Nichols writes about the same place at the same time.  Air Force cold war air defense radar operations began in the area in 1948.   The installation name remained Camp Hero until December 1953 when a portion of it became Montauk AFS. The base was operated by the 773rd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&WS).   The remaining portion of Camp Hero was activated in 1951 as Army anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) training site. It closed in 1957 as part of "Operation Changeover" which saw the mission of AAA batteries in the New York area taken over by Nike surface-to-air missile sites. The last Army personnel left Camp Hero on December 5, 1957. Montauk AFS then absorbed the rest of Camp Hero.   The 773rd AC&WS became the 773rd Radar Squadron (SAGE) and later, as the SAGE air defense control system was phased out, the 773rd Radar Squadron.   Operations at Montauk AFS ended on January 31, 1981. It was planned that the site would close in 1978 but delays in the construction and activation of the replacement radar at Riverhead, N.Y., caused it to stay open. After the base closed, its ground-to-air radio transmit/receive site, the GATR, continued in use for a short time, until the replacement FAA/Joint Surveillance System radar at Riverhead was fully operational. This was coincident with the transfer of air defense control operations from Hancock Field, near Syracuse, N.Y., to the new Northeast Air Defense Sector at Griffiss AFB, N.Y.   The base is interesting but hardly mysterious, inexplicable or unique. There is a lot more about Montauk AFS at Radomes, the Online Radar Museum, easily found on the Internet.  If it was better written, The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time could be fun with a bit of mystery here and a bit of exaggeration there. But there is no fun in this book. It is just the first in a series of dreary paranoid rants against a fantasy world of government conspiracies, aliens and time travel to and from Montauk AFS that exists only in the author's mind.    
 With a dragon on the front cover I thought this would be heavily into medieval fantasy, Dragonlance-style book covers, and game art. There is but ONE artist in the whole book who is a medieval fantasy artist (dragons, elves, etc.). The rest are rather hard to describe. Some just seemed to push the limits of what we will put into the so-called fantasy genre (perhaps because it won't fit in any other genre?).   Don't get me wrong...I appreciate the effort these artists go through to produce their artwork, but unless you have a very non-discriminate art appreciation it's just not for everyone. Just be forewarned that the artists covered in this book belong to a vast array of genres, and while all may be talented in their chosen medium, you will have to be VERY open minded to appreciate all of it.   Even as an aspiring fantasy artist myself I found this book to offer little in the ways of inspiration. For some of the artists it doesn't even say where the works were used or displayed, or how the artist otherwise became well known.   If you are buying this book because you are a medieval or sci-fi fantasy/game art enthusiast, you will be sorely disappointed. Don't judge a book by its cover (I wish Amazon.com had a "search inside" option for this book!). 
 I am having to use this book for an Accounting Grad class and it is perhaps one of the worst txt books I have ever laid my eyes on!  Wordy doesn't begin to describe how bad this book is, did this go through an editor or straight to press?  It just goes on and on and on throwing in examples that come later in the chapter, the examples are poor never follwing a simple path, and the questions at the end of each section are as bad as the book.  This book reminds me of someone who decides to teach you something off of the top of their head, they didn't bother to make any notes or set a goal for how they wanted to approach the subject.  Avoid at all costs!! 
 Ok, check it out, there's two Jack Blacks. One is the guy from Tenacious D, you see him all the time. He's funny and childish and insane. Then there's the other Jack Black. He's the evil creature who pervades films like Shallow Hal and King Kong, whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident. Well, as long as you aren't fat and don't feel patronized by Gweneth presuming to know what it's like not to be desired all her life (ha), then by all means suspend all disbelief, logic, and brain power and watch this dumb movie. Gweneth's fat suit is actually pretty convincing, although most of the movie she's played by an actual fat chick...who by the way should have just been left in, without the whole "ha ha the dude thinks she's skinny" nonsense. Obviously, a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if: a) He weren't brainwashed b) His fat girlfriend wasn't replaced by a twiggy blond chick  c) The movie didn't throw ridiculous concepts your way (like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it) d) Tony Robbins was in no way involved whatsoever  I knew I was slumming it when I saw this movie.  But I'm not sure what the message of this film is.  Jack Black's character is decent, considerate, great with kids and perfect in every way.  Oh, except he's really shallow for no dicernable reason, other than his dad's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail.  The weird part is that Hal's not a bad person.  The movie beats you over the head showing you he's the nicest guy on on the face of the Earth, so you can't really laugh at him looking like an idiot.  Rosemary is so fat she has superpowers.  Her butt actually creates typhoons (I wonder if that has military applications?).  Suddenly, Hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews.  Tony Robbins brainwashed him, the fiend! When Hal finally realizes this he decides to (ooh big spoiler) love Rosemary anyway, and learns a VALUBLE LESSON.  Along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he's dating Rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss, and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental he is dating a fat girl ('cause that would make any woman melt).  Of course there's requisite best friend, played by Jason Alexander, who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get Hal to dump her.  Then again, the friend is a complete troll, so I don't know why Hal would want him around.  And to insult us further, they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a SERIOUS note about how true beauty is on the inside. Too...many...public...service...messages! PICK...ONE..!!   But brain-dead writing aside, Paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit (despite Gweneth's postering when this film was first released). Regardless of its clumsy benevolence, I have to rate this as a romantic comedy. And for that, I give it a rating of totally unremarkable. Nice gesture, Farelly brothers. Not to be bothered with 
 If this were an animated film this would be passable entertainment, but it is not. It is real, and what are you watching is wholesale animal abuse. See, in real life staged films usually require MULTIPLE takes to "get the shot right"; perhaps the angles aren't good enough to use, whatever. All throughout, I kept wondering what horrors the crew was doing behind the camera to get the animals to do what they wanted. If you were utterly naive about the ways of the world and viewed this picture with innocent eyes you might find it cute, after all you have dainty music, deceptive editing, and the charming narration of Dudley Moore. That is the magic of post-production. I'm no animal rights fascist, but this is beyond the pale. Misery is so clear and evident upon the faces of the dog and cat. This is a ghastly production 
 My wife ordered the Rectangular Baker just after Christmas, and it arrived without the glass insert (I wish we would have read the two other reviews).  I re-read the product description and it states it does not ship with the glass insert.  Nonetheless, I called Wilton Armetale to find out their side of the story.  The customer service agent said that Wilton stopped shipping the baker with the glass insert around January of 2004.  The agent suggested I take up my grievance with Amazon.com 
 This book tries to cover everything and succeeds at very little.  It covers everything from how to build a smoker from a used refrigerator to recipes.  But.. none of these topics are covered extensively or very well.    The illustrations are weak; the recipes are very weak; and, the general process discussions are haphazardly organized.    I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews, but am very disappointed 
 Robert Atwan is an absolutely marvelous editor of this series.  But the guest editors, lately, are not literary enough--or rather their choices aren't.  When you reread essays selected by Elizabeth Hardwick ('86) or Cynthia Ozick ('98), they hold up beautifully.  I'm not sure Orlean's pieces are as timeless.  It must be hard, after all these years, to keep finding distinguished new guest editors, so I certainly can't blame Atwan for turning to glossy article writers 
 While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.)  The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin 
 I could barely keep my eyes open through this one. It's so theoretical and dry. There's nothing practical in this for parents. Maybe more so for the professionals. And I HATE the clumsy and awkward "he/she" all the time and all over the place. It's very distracting and highly unprofessional 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
    I bought this book recently after being fed up with cleaning the cat box, stepping on litter that had fallen out, and lugging a ginormous amount of litter up stairs.    The majority (2/3) of this book is about cat behavior, even to what your cat's meows mean. In essence, why cats do what they do and how they have the potential to be toilet trained.    I did more research on the internet before I began Kunkel's method. His method, for me at least, would involve more money being spent than I was inclined to spend (new box that fit the size specifications, undeoderized litter to wean my cats off of the deoderized kind, etc.). Plus, his last few steps involve saran wrap and tape that goes over the bowl of the toilet. In other words, I feel there is a lot of potential for psychological damage for the cat - and maybe the owner, too!    Instead, I purchased a CITIKITTY (www.citikitty.com). My cats used it immediately - 20 minutes out of the box - and I am highly satisfied with the results so far. It is filled with litter and fits over the bowl of the toilet, under the seat. It is durable enough that the cats can stand in it and it is easy enough to take off when I need to use the toilet (no adhesives or other mess). A hole is made in the center that gradually gets larger so that the cat is forced to stand on the seat itself.     Toilet training your cat is an exercise in classical conditioning, whatever methodology you use. Go slow and with the pace of your cat. Good luck 
 This book is very poorly written and badly organized.  Essential introductory topics are sprinkled throughout the book seemingly randomly.  Much of the writing is horribly ambiguous or just plain unreadable.  I am a beginning programmer, though I am highly proficient with Excel.  I was lucky to be familiar with some other programming languages because the explanations of object-oriented programming concepts in this book (as well as other topics covered) would have been completely incomprehensible without a moderate level of background experience.  The examples in the book are neither practical, nor particularly well designed to illustrate the VBA concepts that the authors are trying to teach.  Instead, the authors seem to be preoccupied with designing examples to convey stylistic programming conventions that they personally favor.  
 OK, I know that Dale Brown is not Tom Clancy, but I have all his books and for the most part they aren't too bad.  Most of them are pretty exciting techno-thrillers that get started really fast and keep going.  This thing is the worst piece of tripe I have ever read!  There is a plot, but the author tries to stretch a 25 page short story into 400 pages of boring, repetitive dialog.  The first 200 pages alone consist of the characters mainly struggling arguing with each one another on how to run a special terrorist ops group.  At any rate, if this is the new direction for Dale Brown books, I will be looking for a new author because this book is not worth the time to read it 
 I am a 20 year user of several Remington products, but I must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver.  The Remington ES-1000 Utra Smooth Bump Control Shaver was designed to replace the original (BMS) Black Man's Shaver which was discountinued several years ago.  I recently purchased and used the ES-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance.  The ES-1000 performed so poorly that I had to use my BMS that I had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the ES-1000 shaver could not and did not remove.  The product should be called "Ultra poor with a sandpaper finish."  The product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet.  For anyone with curly hair problems, you may want to consider comparing this product against the Wahl 5-Star Series, Model # 8061.  I think you will find there is a major difference in the products 
    This was disappointing reading for me--after a rather abstruse (but perhaps technically useful to some) delineation of various factors involved in analyzing "state building," the application to any real situations was extremely thin and nothing new. Nor was much "meat" put on the skeleton.  It reminded me of  university situations where publishing periodically is a necessity.  (However, the subject area is only an interest of mine--my Ph.D. is in a different field. 
 This movie, while not a bomb or a turkey, has a couple of serious flaws. One is the casting. Ted Wass has lots of credits to his name, according to IMDb, but what a wimpy, character-less, uninteresting washout he is! Was Blake going for a Harold Lloyd lookalike? He got one, but there's nothing else to recommend him. He looks like a Clark Kent without the Superman suit underneath.  The other flaw is the length. Even the opening credits (using a deFreiling/Patie ripoff style) go on forever. But the slapstick, which is masterful as always (Blake having been raised on or at least heavily influenced by silent comedies, especially those of Laurel & Hardy)...my God, does he stretch things out here!  The cameos are the saving grace, especially Roger Moore's. His vocal impersonation of Clousseau is perfect. Why didn't he dub the voice for Clousseau in the concurrently filmed TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER? Whoever did that voiceover sounded like Sellers on helium!  It's sad to see our icons age, especially Burt Kwouk, who looks and sounds awfully tired. David Niven looks as close to death as he actually was. Rich Little's uncredited overdubbing was beautifully done: subtle and convincing.  Herbert Lom's Dreyfuss got bigger and more ridiculous in each successive film. And Harvey Korman's Prof. Balls is delightful. The entire scene in his shop is a stitch.  No, there will never be another Sellers (and I have no intention of seeing the new film with Steve Martin). But Blake could have done better with his stopgaps 
 This is one of the few books where I can honestly say that the movie was better...  much better.  I was not impressed with Koontz's bad guy who was not very well developed at all.  The world is not so black and white, which makes things far more interesting 
 After all the rave reviews this book has gotten I was surprised to be disappointed. My 21 month old daughter who LOVES books found this book to be utterly boring. (We began potty training about a month ago.) I tried reading it to her on several occasions but she lost interest after a couple of pages every time. Maybe it would be better for an older child. It seemed to have too many words and was very long. I liked that they showed a baby breast feeding and a father being involved with everything. However, the illustrations were uninspired. The text is very straight forward which is either a plus or a minus (clear or boring?) depending on your point of view. It is definately instructional. I will just have to keep looking for a potty training book I like. Or not. My daughter seems to be doing just fine without one 
 The men literally drag the women by their hair in this novel, it is beyond me how it got categorized as a romance.  The romance is virtually non-existant whereas violence is abundant.  If you're looking for brutality, rape, incest, homosexuality, and things of that nature, read this novel.   
 It's rare that I don't finish a book.  I realized after getting 1/3 of the way through it that I just couldn't get interested in the characters. Took it back to the library. A friend of mine who also reads a lot had the same experience. Harris' other books were much better 
 I didn't see this fact in any of the other reviews of this player.  I have had it for about 24 hours. My discovery is that there is no way to resume playing a disc after the power is turned off.  In other words, if you watch a dvd and decide you want to stop for awhile, the player has no function which allows you to resume from the point at which you stopped--if you've turned the power off. Believe me, I tried everything.  The bookmark feature looked promising until I read the information that all bookmarks are reset when the power is turned off. I have never seen a dvd player that didn't have the resume feature--no matter how inexpensive. The pluses of this player--primarily the georgous screen and the remote--do not compensate for the omission of this feature.  In fact, a portable player would certainly seem to be subject to watching for awhile, then stopping and then re-starting.  How cumbersome to have to sort through the dvd menu--assuming your dvd has one!--to try and find the place where you left off. Were it not for the ommission of this feature, I would have rated this player as 4 stars, and would have definitely kept it 
 Horrible.  I could feel my IQ drop while reading this book 
 The author spends much of the book pandering to our primal fears in support of violent self-defense.  It is not clear who he is writing for, police, lone gunmen or military personnel.  If he would leave out his disturbing viewpoints, perhaps this book may be taken more seriously.  Save your money and buy something by Andy Sanford 
 I was browsing for 2-way radios in a store and this set caught my eyes because they use Li-ion batteries.  Most other radios use the older NiMH technology so I thought the extra battery life would be good.  Well, I just got back from a trip and the radios perormed horribly.  From the beach to my 4th floor hotel room, the distance could not have been more than 1/4 mile with a line of sight, and the reception was hit or miss.  Even when the call button worked, the speech usually was not intelligible.  I am trying, but I cannot come up with a single positive thing to say about this product.  I will go back to using my older Motorola set until I find a suitable GMRS set 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 Yuck.  This was terrible.  First, there were too many narratives from too many people. Second, the original intent of all the characters was totally destroyed.  Adele is portrayed as a schemer - even at one point  believing she must kill Antoinette (Bertha, I suppose was not a glamourous enough name) because it might reunite her mother with Edward.  Mr. Rochester has no redeaming qualities at all - he's an abusive alcoholic.  And Jane!  She is reduced to a simpleton who is oblivious to the world around her.  Adele, who in the original book adored Jane as the only person who showed her kindness, says of Jane that she has a "banality of mind."   Don't even get me started on Mrs. Fairfax!!!!  Then there are the plot lines that are started, but never finished.  Like the appearance of a brother somewhere at the end and endless streams of her mother's lovers and friends.  I kept reading in the hopes it would improve, but it didn't. I guess I'm just glad that I got this book on the bargain shelf for 1/3 of the price listed.  The bookstore obviously knew something I didn't 
 The author is the official photographer for the International Fencing Federation.  While his own experience is mainly in fencing, he also incorporates the work of other sports photographers in his book, which according to the introduction, is aimed at every photographer except full time professional sports photographers.  The book is divided into four main parts. Understanding digital sports photography includes a general introduction, a section about workflow and a discussion of equipment and techniques.  Shooting sports on location groups the approach to different sports depending on their venue.  Working in the digital studio discusses the requirements for digital processing and processing techniques.  A section on presentation talks about everything from printing through earning money from your photographs to legal issues.  I found the section on shooting sports on location the most useful.  For example you can turn to the chapter on indoor competition sports and find a number of hints that may prove useful in such a venue.  Unfortunately, other parts of the book are less useful.  While the author is undoubtedly a good photographer, his organizational skills as a writer are weak.  He will repeat the same advice over and over.  For example on a single page he will ask "[W]hat if you inadvertently click the wrong setting and delete all the photos..?" and then a few sentences later say "Don't be in a hurry.  More than one photographer has deleted a card without meaning to...."  He often gives wrong advice.  For example, he states that you cannot upgrade from Photoshop Elements to the full blown Photoshop.  Yet for some time now, and as of the date of this writing, Adobe has given a $100 discount to Photoshop Elements owners on the purchase of Photoshop.  He also gives contradictory advice.  On one page he recommends establishing a digital darkroom with "a good-quality monitor, preferably the CRT kind, not an LCD display."  A few pages later he says "a good quality LCD will be perfectly sufficient."  His discussion of digital processing could have been limited to a discussion of some of the possibilities of Photoshop.  Instead he provides just enough instruction to confuse any would-be user.  But the biggest problem is that he leaves out the discussion of factors that are important to new digital photographers.  For example, one of the tools that separates film from digital in the control of exposure is the in-camera histogram.  Yet there is no mention of the facility until the chapter on darkroom processing and then it is given short shrift.  For another example, digital cameras shoot in various formats like Raw and JPEG, which is not as flexible for post-processing as Raw but creates smaller picture files.  Digital cameras store picture files in a buffer before they write the data to a memory card.  When the buffer is full, the camera will not take a photograph.  For this reason sports photographers, who often shoot in long bursts, prefer JPEG so that they can store more pictures in the buffer.  Timacheff does not even suggest that this might be a reason for selecting JPEG over Raw.  If you purchase this book for the tips on shooting in sports locations, you may find it useful.  Otherwise, you will probably be disappointed.  
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 Horrible, Horrible, Horrible..better than Democracy in America but still why make us poor college students suffer so much. haven't we paid our debt to society already 
 This book is a joke...There are NO Secrets to be learned here. It is written by someone who knows nothing about Tattooing and even less about telling you how to do anything. All it is is a bunch of in series photos of tattooing with a small explanation (nothing informative)with each photo, and you learn nothing from it at all. My Opinion...A TOTAL WASTE OF PAPER! Tells nothing about what you need to know to be able to do the same kind of work, which, by the way was about 75% garbage work and maybe 25% talent. Overall I wouldn't waste your money on this one! If I could give it minus stars for a rating I would 
 The book was advertised with CD, i received no CD in it. When i contacted abebook, they send me e-mail that i have to complain to amazon 
 P. Erlich is one of the members of the league of the profets of disgrace, people that earn money (in general, a lot of money) by telling that this and that catastrophe is going to happen. His favourite one is "overpopulation". That myth is more than  dead and, in fact, people are beggining to be concern about quite the opposite, underpopulation. Read instead the great "The Ultimate Resource 2" by Julian Simon 
 My unit failed after one day of use (never even got to the field.) Plugged it in to charge it overnight and next day only the blue LED would come on but could no longer connect. Bluetooth connections can be tricky and the paper manual provided is worthless. The on-CD manual better but is still way too spartan for a device like this.  I liked the standard mini-USB cable connection for the charger (similar feature on my RAZR) but I found it vexing that you couldn't use that same cable for data (it appears to be a standard cable) but instead have to buy a "special" cable for using the data port. They give you the mobile AND AC charger but the omission of a data cable seems odd. Other units using Bluetooth and USB (such as the 4-in-1 by Wintec) provide this. I found a LOT of complaints and kudos for this unit surfing for solutions to my issues so it appears that their are some quality control problems in the manufacturing. Folks with working units seem to love them. If you get one with the bad solder connections, you are disappointed 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 We bought ours from Amazon in October, and have been disappointed with the DVD player, which has a flaw documented in the manual that more than outweighs any convenience provided by the built-in player.  Unfortunately, we got to the point where the DVD player could not play any DVD's.  Every DVD inserted produced a message "Disc Not Available".  I tried Netflix DVD's, then retail DVD's from my library, then opened some DVD's still in shrinkwrap and they would not play.  It was not a problem with DVD scratches, or failing to put the DVD's in the right way.  I called Toshiba support, and they recommended a cure that sounded incredulous.  According to the manual, static electricity can "build up" in the DVD player, forcing you to physically unplug the REGZA for a few minutes to dissipate the charge.  Of course, to reduce cable clutter, the REGZA is plugged into a receptacle in an out of the way place, but to meet the requirements of the manual, that should be accessible.  The plug going into the back of the REGZA is not even designed so it could be unplugged there, it has to be unplugged at the receptacle.  And, it is not even a grounded power cord, which an electrical engineer I talked to about this said could contribute to the problem in the first place.  After the aforementioned "hard reboot" of the REGZA, it resumed playing retail DVD's again.    Unfortunately, the DVD player is not of high enough quality to play any of the DVD-R and DVD+R media I've tried so far (TDK, Memorex, Office Depot, Maxell) which were burned with a Sony DVDirect VRD-MC1.  These same DVD's play in my computer DVD drive and with my Pioneer DVD player in another room.  On the plus side, we've been happy with the images we get, and haven't noticed some of the LCD artifacts we observe on our smaller Sony WEGA TV.  We watch a lot of HD through cable, and the display is crisp.  We use the HDMI connector, and haven't used any of the computer/network functions of the monitor, so we can't comment on them.  The only minor comment about the display itself is that we use this in a room that is very bright during the day, and very dark at night, so I only wish it had greater range on the low side for its "Backlight" setting.  If Toshiba can come up with a design that doesn't require periodic unplugging, and can play a more robust range of DVD media, I could recommend it.  As built today, I do not feel the integrated DVD is worth recommending this model 
 I was disappointed with the shoes when I received them.  On the website, the shoes looked Gold in color and were described as Gold, but when I received the shoes they were beige.  I am sorry to say that I could not wear the shoes.   
 Tony Brown's book isn't backed up by any facts, just "conspiracies" he's heard. I'm convinced Mr. Brown is a Lyndon Larouche supporter who is a paraniod schizophrenic. Though some parts where interesting to read, which is why I gave it two stars, I found it hard to follow one-accusation to another. I didn't believe anything he wrote. 
 Horrible camera. Barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz.Drained the batteries within a few pictures.So not worth more then the cost of a disposable!! Sorry Kodak...but I'll stick with the good ol' reliable Sony 
 Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, "Okay, give it your best shot!"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn 
 The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history. The books is misleading in that regard 
 I purchased one of the shark pro steamers and used it once.  Came back to it a month later and the cap had seized totally shut.  They are aware of the problem but fail to document it or do anything about it.  The steamer is about 100 buck and to send it back for repair is 25 buck shipping and another 50 to Inspect.  For that price I should just toss it in the trash or use it as a $100 paper weight that's all it's good for.  Don't buy anything from euro pro!!!! they make junk. 
 I was impressed and enjoyed Wiccan Mysteries (would give it a 5 out of 5 for what it is worth) by this very author and so I purchased this book and I thought it would be as well thought out.  Instead as I read it I found most of it was watered down basics of the foundation of "wiccan magick" and I would suggest many other books for a beginner before this one; which was written with out the background information. Overall I found that it didn't say anything particularly refreshing, ingenuitive or really thought provoking to keep me interested.  One of my disagreements with this book was a chapter on stones/crystals that was very inadequate.  If you like to read books that sound more like folklore then magick or a path to spirituality rather then a little stroll in the lifeless park of religion then you might just Like this book a great deal 
 Do not buy this book! Why, you ask? This is a quote from chapter 15, p.212: "In TV advertising, the manufacturers can get name publicity in two ways if they desire, namely, by flashing the product name in big print on the screen and by having the name frequently repeated by the announcer" (!). Now, you're probably wondering why I'm giving a quote from *PAGE 212!*. Well, that's because I forced myself to read this because it was written by some legendary ad guy. But don't make the same error as I did. Please buy Ogilvy on Advertising, Cutting Edge Adverting, Creative Advertising and Hey Whipple instead. Yes, all of them instead of Tested Advertising Methods. You won't be disappointed. Or your money back (just kidding) 
 What's the deal with glorifying gangster behavior?  This cat is a poor role model for youngsters with his swagger and gangster affectations.  The author needs to straighten out this feline 
 We are HUGE Amazon customers and we have always been so pleased with our purchases.  However we were shocked when we went to use 4 out of 6  of these expensive wine glasses.  THEY FELL APART!  The glass is tissue thin!  Perhaps from shipping there are many fine fractures????  One fell apart in my guest's hand...three fell apart later that night while being rinsed out.  we handled these glasses so delicatly...I have 2 more and we would like to send them back and be reimbursed for all 6. 
 This book made me want to 'go viking' - in other words take a long trek away from it!  Why are people always so accepting of the 'fact' that men in early history 'must' have been cruel and stubborn, coarse and violent therefore it's ok for hero's in books to behave so.  I don't actually agree with any of that. Historical fact shows that men, then as now, could be caring, sharing beings who actually liked their wives and kids! William the Conqueror adored his wife as did John of Lancaster his Kathryn and Henry his Eleanor of Aquitaine.   So why did the hero here have to be so unsympathetic and the heroine so accepting of her treatment at his hands - human nature is diverse and being a Viking in the 8/9thC didn't make you any more liable to be a thug than living in the 21stC makes every man a saint does it?  I heartily agree with a lot of the other reviewers that for the author to subscribe to the idea that violent times create violent people and therefore 'Viking' must equate with thuggery is short-sighted and trite and boring to read 
 I thought I was saving a little by buying this scale but it arrived with dead batteries which cost another $15.00 to replace. It also only works half the time, displaying very low or very high numbers, it has to be "reset" often in order to display the right numbers 
 for non writers who manipulate everything to suit their conceptions.  the FACTS completely debunk this book.  Thankfully, these men will fade; the true mysteries remain unanswered waiting, perhaps, for someone without personal gain to cull through, define and present.  What a nasty book 
 I purchased this book to augment Baby Bargains - what a waste. When the majority of the information is not in the handy ratings methodology their magazine uses - What's the point??  It appears that they cobbled together a list of products and put in the manufacturers' descriptions in paragraph form along with the statement that they didn't review items in this category.  I was deceived by the publisher - this was not a report by consumers or even their own people - this was just an advertisement for a bunch of baby products that was SOLD to me based on their "trusted" name.  The truly disgusting part is that I paid them for this and they probably made money on the back-end from the manufacturers by charging them to be included in the book.   Not only should you save your money, but you should question the impartiality of Consumer Reports 
 I was diasppointed that this is a rather basic book for people who are not aware of ageing and nutrional issues.   
 I love ethereal, ambient, healing New Age.  I have at least 250 CDs of this genre in my collection.  This will not be #251.  Do you remember the electronic piano/casio electric keyboard sound of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood?  It is in most of the songs on this album.  The few songs that don't have this are decent, but if you want truly healing, contemplative music, try Liquid Mind, Anugama, Raphael or others like them 
 Why? Someone tell me why. Someone e-mail me and explain to me why. There is nothing to gain here. Nothing to be learned, nothing to excite, no story. Why? Seriously, is there any documentation that might explain WHY this thing (not a film) exists. Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is so unprecedented in it's poorness, that it doesn't even succeed in being a dumb slasher flick. Let me reiterate. The filmmakers actually FAILED at the least complicated genre in the book. If I wanted a series of randomly assembled images leading nowhere I would have rented "Week End".  The only reason to see this is that ever crafty curiosity value. Yes, you will be compelled to watch, if only to observe some clue as to why both Matthew McConaughey (pre-"A Time to Kill") and Renée Zellweger (pre-"Jerry Maguire") accepted the lead roles (the clue never comes). Texas Chain Saw fans will, of course, feel the completist need to see this, the death knell of the series. And finally, I think just the concept of Leatherface as a shrieking cross-dresser will garnish a few bewildered viewers. But believe me folks, this still doesn't answer the ultimate question: Why? Why?! WHY? 
 I love this movie as I have seen it many times.  Audie Murphy did a great job in playing himself, although it must have been really hard to relive.  A movie that I would highly recommend. 
 This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system.  This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.  I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.  The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.  About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.    Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.  And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.  So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other 
 I did not find this book as helpful as I was hoping. First, and most importantly, I needed more examples. There was only one and it was a service organization and I needed to see an example of a manufacturing organization where the target customer was not so geographically limited. Also, I found that the way the book is organized was difficult. I felt the book was more oriented toward helping someone sort out their thoughts and feelings about starting a business than it was focused on actually structuring and writing a business plan. What I actually need are the hard, factual mechanics of writing a business plan and I did not find it to my satisfaction in this book 
 I'm a master gardener, so I picked up this book eagerly. Unfortunately, although the book is nice to look at, the information it contains is pretty old and in some cases, just mistaken. There are many other books that  contain much better research than what is found here 
 Witty and funny, yes....but also just more trite trash about how inconvenient kids are and how to minimize any effect they might have on your life. I especially hate how she writes in a conspirational tone, like we're all doing these awful things and she's the one actually admitting to it, like denying your kids naps til its convenient for you, throwing them at sick grandparents or whomever so you can go shoe shopping, and feeding them fast food to shut them up. I'm not so sure she even likes her kids after reading this, and I don't recommend it for a new parent. Give a newbie something encouraging and positive, not this. 
 The foam padding does not have enough consistancy. It stays compressed with in a short period of time.  Not recommended 
 Leave this one "on the shelf"!! A "Hotwheels" product which doesn't come with "wheels"!????!!!  Who would have thought at $25.00 it doesn't come with a car and then they have the nerve to make it not work with other Hotwheels cars!! This is a very annoying junk toy which was such a disappointment to my son Christmas morning.  I would not have been so disatisfied had I shopped on Amazon and got it for the price being offered now--$5.00!!  
 I believe the title of this book is misleading, perhaps for the marketing purpose, to tap in to the people suffering from eczema.    The author did have eczema, it seems, and rather severe one, but what's different from my case was that she also had "candida overgrowth" or what's usually called yeast infection, on skin.  So, her diet focuses so much on "clearing the yeast out of your system."  I admit I didn't try her diet, but I didn't want to because I didn't want to get sick from not having enough nutrients due to this very partial diet. (I didn't want to take many supplements because of it.)  It may be true, at least to some extent, that "yeast is an interferer" which is not making your eczema go away completely, but I strongly believe that's not the case for many, many people with moderate to severe eczema problem.  I also bought "Skin Deep - A Mind/Body Program for Healthy Skin" together, and I don't think I need any other book. I strongly recommend "Skin Deep" than this, unless you suspect you have the yeast infection as part of your problem.  By the way, this book is very thin - a little thicker than brochures - 43 pages, including the references, just so that you won't be surprised when you get it 
 As a musician I appreciate Feinstein's "carrying the torch" if you will for this genre if music. This CD has pretty well soured me on his more recent work. After "Forever" he seemed to make some  fundamental changes to his approach and performance of this style of music.  For my tastes, it's not working like his earlier releases did. Too much  production, odd interpretations, and a sense of trying things almost for  the sake of trying them... When Feinstein is on his game, he's likely the  best going, but lately he's not "got game"...spend your money on  a Harry Connick,Jr. CD...you'll have a lot more fun.. 
    Overall the concept is very good. Works great in my truck, works great in my home. Lots of road trips through the midwest and never had lost signal issues. I even brought it on a fishing trip near the Canada border and used my extra truck antenna. We were 2 hours from the nearest paved road and it worked great.     But I've had this product since Dec of 2005 and have had to return it 3 times. I don't get reception at work so I like to record at night and playback the next day. Works great for about 2-3 months then no more sound on recorded material. Have to send it back and its on my dime and I have to live without it for about 3-4 weeks.     I wish this product was made a little better. I wanted to give it 5 stars but 3 returns in 14 months not very good.     The only thing I had to buy extra for this product was a holder for my truck otherwise it came with everything you need 
 ......................................................................  This book is as much an advertisement for OSX as it is help. Pogue starts by introducing OSX as "the best personal-computer operating system on earth" - which it very well might be - and keeps on singing his ode to Apple on the remaining 750 pages of the manual.  Don't get me wrong: I am an Apple fan myself. After having used Windows for over a decade, two years ago I finally got myself a G4 Powerbook and I swear by it. I am now a walking ad for Apple, short of tattooing one on my forehead. I have learned to use OSX without a manual and decided to get myself one just to be on the safe side.   I spent a whole day reading through different OSX manuals in the store before picking "The Missing Manual" and, unfortunately, as of today do not have an alternative recommendation. I am also aware of how hard it must be to write a good manual. However, in absolute terms, this one still sucks.   OSX is mainly self-explanatory and, where it is not, this book rarely helps. It is not useless, just very incomplete, full of praise and poorely organized.   I use my Powerbook for video-editing, I network, use AirPort and a few other gadgets and usually manage with the help of my regular genius brain and Apple's resources. I did learn a few tricks from this manual as well. However, I would need a manual that helps me (just a tiny bit) with troubleshooting. This one does not.   I am glad I bought this volume and it may very well be the best on the market. But who cares? The fact that there may be no better book out there does not mean we have to waste all our stars on this one. If you find the manual we are still missing, please let us know your name - the place on my forehead is still vacant 
 I too am a first time coach, but I have played basketball in school and leagues for a number of years. The video is slow and lacks any real wisdom about the game. There is not enough focus on drills and ways to "coach" new players on fundaments. "Dribbling and Shooting are important" - Yes, thank you, I got that. How about something a little more indepth? A serious basketball fan could have made something similar. I do not reccomend 
 If people of influence and those aspiring to such a position want to ensure that the poor stay poor and wilful manipulation of trade is the norm, this book by Joseph E. Stiglitz is the one to read, to know how to maintain this inequality. Terminology abounds which panders to the common misunderstanding of such things as fairness, monopolies, natural resources and  wealth, for example. He also has an annoying habit of telling us about what is bad, is going to suggest some remedy, and then skips on to the next thing to criticise.   Natural resources are, by and large, simply the raw material basis from which products are manufactured using capital and intellect in order to create things of value and subsequently wealth through trade. Crude oil and metal ores which are the significant natural resources are of scant direct value to most purchasers. Even crops such as wheat and bananas require much capital and labour inputted into their production and distribution, etc., to be of any significant value to the overall economy of a country.  There is no such thing as a private monopoly. Only a government has the ability to create and maintain a monopoly since government is the sole legitimate power which can use force and the law to prevent others from trading in the market. Microsoft is a favourite to cite, but this is totally wrong since Microsoft can not use force or the law to make computer users use their software or prevent the use of alternatives such as Linux or FreeBSD, for example.  The only fairness that is meaningful in a global economy is the freedom of opportunity which the abolition of trade barriers, government subsidies and regulation, the free movement of people across the globe and the implementation and recognition of private property rights enables. This would also have to include no government printing or minting of money, and central banking would have to be done away with, too, with private banks taking on this role. The private banks would be limited by a return to the gold standard with no fractional reserve banking permitted  Simply citing example after example of how the current norm must be further regulated by tribunals and of-the-moment political expediencies such as environmentalism is of no value whatever.   For a proper understanding about what will work in a globalized economy, I would recommend: 'Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics by George Reisman'         
 I was very excited to get these boots, they looked to be excellent quality and a great value.  I ordered them in plenty of time to take them on our planned weekend away.  They did not arrive, instead I recieved some sort of excercise ball in what was suppose to be the boots.  I immediately contacted AMAZON because at that point I only had 3 days before my trip.  I asked them to please send the boots immediately because of the mistake.  They instead said that I had to contact FOGDOG directly.  I did and FOGDOG said sorry, we can only send you the boots if you order, pay for them again and pay for the express shipping.  Then return the excercise ball and get refunded for the original purchase.  I had to go out and buy the boots at a local store.  I am still waiting for the refund of the excercise ball and it has been 3 weeks.      After many great purchases from Amazon over the years I am now saidly disappointed.  This will change my Amazon purchase plans in the future.    
 Wow, I sampled the songs on this new CD and I really am surprised at the drop in quality and uniqueness Sting used to bring to the music.  Like DeNiro and Pacino.  Where are they now?  Doing comedy and bland movies.  Not like the movies of yester-year when they were top notch.  Stings voice is still among the best in the world, just the music behind him is what makes his CDs bland and uninteresting.  I mean, Techno and Rap.  It's like a mundane chant, much like the Sting of the past used to sing out about.  It looks like the music industry of today is not only responsible for some of the most uninteresting music and groups it's also consuming those that used to be the best.  It's really a shame to see an artist like Sting decline in his work.  Brand New Day was the start.  Although it wasn't all bad, but you got the sense that he was lost or beginning to lose his way and his style.  Oh, well, albums like "Ten Summoner's Tale", "Nothing Like the Sun", "Soul Cages", and "Dream of the Blue Turtles" were the best of his solo career.  Now, he's just earning a paycheck.  Farewell Sting.  It was nice knowing you 
 I've had this for 18 mos.  Something came loose in the body and it is now rather noisy.  Also, there are times when I have to turn the unit off, then on, to get the heating element to engage.  I'm keeping this one, but wouldn't buy it again 
 ... I don't recommend this book. I enjoyed it all the way to the last page. But after receiving several paper cuts trying to find the additional pages that should be there, I felt like I was "R", the main character, trying to determine if someone had pulled a hoax on me. That said, if there is a part 2 (I haven't found anything indicating there will be), I'll buy it. Mr. Lehrer raised a lot of interesting situations -- I'd like an end to complement the beginning and middle 
 The only thing this book succeeded in doing was turning me off about getting an MBA.  As a software developer, I would have thought my background in mathematics would have been sufficient to understand a supposed-overview of accounting, finance, and economics topics, but I found these chapters dry and they seemed to simply present a great deal of equations that made little sense out of context.  I may still go for an MBA someday, but this book did little to prepare me, tide me over in the meantime, or excite me about the possibility of mastering the topics 
 My mother gave me this book and her first cookbook, too.  Hard to believe, but this book seems worse than the first one.  She must get paid a bazillion dollars by the Processed Food Association because no one in their right mind would use so much crappy processed food in their recipes.  She seems totally oblivious to the fact that fresh food is available in her regular supermarket and that its just as easy to use in recipes 
 I am a Liz Phair from the "Exile" era, and unlike many old-time fans, I've followed her every step of the way and taken the stops, starts and turns in stride.  I didn't even mind her self-titled album, which I found unchallenging but still catchy.  I continued supporting her, even traveling long distances to see her on a couple of occasions.  Sadly, I'm afraid it may be all over after this CD.  I ignored the advance publicity for the album, intent on making up my own mind.  And even then, I held off judgment, assuming the CD would grow on me--because it certainly didn't do a thing for me at first (or second, or third, or...) listen.  Today, I discovered the CD in a stack of rarely-played disks, and I realized I hadn't listened to it in ages.  So, I put it on to give it another try, hoping I'd missed something the first time around.  But I was again sadly disappointed.  There is little to like about this album, regardless of whether you're a fan of Liz's or not.  It doesn't have the pop elements that soured some on the last album, and that's exactly the problem.  This is bland, faceless music with no personality at all.  Were it not Liz singing, I'd not listen to it more than once, and I don't know how many more times I will, anyway.    If I wanted Sheryl Crow, I'd buy Sheryl Crow.  But this isn't even good Sheryl Crow, which is a really sad statement.  I may give Liz one more chance, but if her next offering isn't WAY better than this, then I'll definitely be giving up for good.  And I never thought I'd say that about her.  What a drag 
 First, the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least.  Second, it is opaque, so the kids couldn't even take in their surroundings. Since it resembles a parachute, the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing wouldn't stay attached to the stroller, the kids probably wouldn't have had fresh air. Go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead 
 Purchased this guide and the Kauai Revealed for an upcoming trip to the islands.  Revealed is far and away a much more informative and seemingly provides unbiased assessments. Unlike most guide books it actually makes for interesting reading.  Kauai Underground does not provide indepth enough descriptions and/or directions to sights. I gave the Underground 2 stars only because it came with the CD of Hawaiian music which I did find enjoyable 
 These did nothing for me. Ask your doctor about aphthasol, a prescription drug approved by the FDA -- which means it's passed rigorous government testing standards. Aphthasol changed my life 
 I really truely wish I would read reviews and stop ordering from Amazon. All four pieces are broken. One in tiny bits. Stupid me just opened the package from a month ago! 
 I really expected more. Rhino, the author of the Stiff Records and 'Left of the Dial' box sets and the 'Just Can't Get Enough' series assembled this tired set of eighties new wave? Wow.  A third of this CD has been anthologized to death. Toni Basil? Men Without Hats? A-Ha? Modern English? Thomas Dolby? Dexy's Midnight Runners? Again??? Where's Nena and "99 Luftballoons"?   I could name six more interesting choices in my sleep: Pete Shelley. Freur. Lene Lovich. Heaven 17. Fun Boy Three. Blancmange.   Gary Numan, Haircut 100 and Frank & Moon Zappa lend a breath of fresh air, and Rhino does their usual stellar job of remastering, but it's not enough.  This is for the person who: A. is an extremely casual music fan (i.e. buys a CD about every other year), or B. is too young to have been around when these songs were all over the airwaves.  Otherwise, you likely have the better stuff on this CD elsewhere, and who needs to hear "Mickey" ever again? (And I mean EVER again.) If you fit one of the two profiles listed above, you'll be completely content. If you don't--save your money.     
 I was expecting something positive, since I have enjoyed several of John Edward's other books; but this was so bad I was disheartened that he went through with having it published at all.  The characters are not well developed, the plot is uninspired and the massive intervention from the "other side" is so deus ex machina that it isn't even believable as fiction 
 I got about 40% through it, but couldn't make myself finish this one, since I just couldn't care about the protagonist. Grace Archer is a control freak. That causes her to make foolish decisions. She has trouble accepting help when she's in over her head. If she were family, you'd stick by her. If she's only a character in a book, you might just close the book and say, "Enough!" I did 
 This is a wonderful book to read if you want to imagine yourself living somewhere exotic in an uncluttered space with minimal (or no) possessions.    It's all about design and I'm sure design mavens and architect-groupies will love it.    I picked it up looking for "good ideas" (as advertised in the title) I could use in, or adapt for, my small condo.  In my real life as a middle-class working person living in the US.  I found none.    Pretty pictures, though, of some inventive solutions to putting bed, bath, kitchen, and sitting facilities into small areas.  
 This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall.  Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least.  Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered.  Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college.  It was trying to be the next generation "Graduate" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia.  I guess I was just a little more bitter.  Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did.  That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team.  It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past.  Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties.    This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset.  It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.    
 This is one of the best books I have ever read on the Revolutionary War.  Even though it is technically classified as a novel, it is accurately presented history. Mr. Shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book, and presented the historical events accurately, as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable.  The main participants in the Revolutionary War were presented not as gods, but as truly great and courageous men and women.  He also presented the details of battles, troop movements, condition of troops, and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events.  I have a better understanding of the Revolutionary War years than I have ever had, and would highly recommend this book to every American who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country.  
 I was forced to buy and read this book for an American History class and I KNOW some may say that I am biased because I was required to read this book, but I must say, it is absolutly horrible. As a journalism major I found this book very hard to read. Every chapter talks about the same thing.  The delegates can't decide on anything, everything is based on property and nothing is resolved. (well, until the end, obviously) Perhaps that is how the real constitutional convention happened, but i don't need to read the same thing over and over for 200 pages. Often, the author side tracks on little tid bits of personal information about the delegates that seem totally unrealted to the story at the time. Unless you are a seventy year old man, I don't think you will find this book interesting at all 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one.  Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone.  The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often 
 Although I enjoyed the book for casual reading, it was very short on both pictures and specific plant care info. The authors seem to enjoy commenting on the plants that they have included but 'Passalong Plants' is not for you  if you are looking for technical information.  I wanted it to tell me  specifically how to divide, the best time to harvest passalong plants and  give good drawings/photos of the plants listed.   One of the more  disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon 
 1. Samples sound awful and out of tune 2. Volume resets to ear-splitting level upon powercycle 3. Sample tunes sound awful and out of tun 
 I know this guy has been around for a while. But I just can't help but notice just how horrible his music is. His keyboardist is more annoying than a harmonica. And his songs are all BORING! I've produced better stuff in the toilet! 
 After reading "Why Do Men Have Nipples" and loving it, I had high hopes for book number two.  I really enjoyed all the chapters in book 1, excluding the dialogue between the authors.  I found it boring and irrelevant to the book itself.  I skipped those sections.  The chapter topics were written humorously but gave factual information. Very fun and interesting!  This book, was boring.  The chapter topics are not nearly as interesting as the first book's.  Once again there is the annoying dialogue (which I skipped).  There was virtually no humor in this book. I felt like the authors scraped the barrel to come up with topics this time around. I was VERY disappointed in this book. I read it in a couple hours. Zzzzz.  Guess these authors are good for just one time 
 I bought this based on the excellent reviews and was very disappointed. We played it at a gathering and no one wanted to continue the DVD after the first 8-10 minute 
 I guess I looked for White to provide thought provoking insight into the older/younger gay relationship. I found the book dull and lacking any real direction. The characters were uninteresting and one demensional. The plot dragged on and on and never really went anywhere. I actually found myself skipping paragraphs trying to get to the point of the story. I apologize to anyone who might find this review offensive, but I didn't enjoy this book at all 
 I don't know why this cd showed up in a JON ANDERSON do not make the same mistake this cd is not the lead singer from YE 
 This was not what I expected, I love "food" movies like "Eat drink man woman", "Tortilla Soup", "Like Water for Chocolate",This movie was just a long boring trek through bad accents and poorly lit italian food, I realize that the food was supposed to be showcased here, but it didnt wet my appetite a bit, a can of chef boyardee looks more appetizing. I was glad the restaurant tanked, that louis prima didnt show up. The "big night" turned out to be a tiny blip of a movie 
 Ingersoll missed all the evidence that has been found that proves that the Bible is true.  He was not looking at this situation with an unbias mind like he tells his readers to do 
 The content is so elementary that this book cannot be considered a serious reference work for writers. Many of the "Common Errors" seem to have been made up in order to complete a targeted page count. If you already know the difference between "chunk" and "chuck," and know when to use "next door" instead of "next store" to convey your intended meaning, you can pass on this one 
 1. Knobs fell off within a few weeks.  Nice appearance but very cheaply made. 2.  Replacement knobs are on backorder for 4 weeks, apparently, it happens alot.  I don't expect the new knobs to last very long either if it's the same design. 3.  The on/off switch is connected to the timer.  When cooking is done, the timer should "ding".  But when I switch it from on to off, it shouldn't ding also! 4.  The on/off light indicator is impossible to see unless you're in pitch darkness.   Seems like a hazard to me. 5.  Other than that, it works..so far.  It does have a nice Stainless Steel look however 
 Get the book, this one covers off on some of what he went thru but falls flat on the time he spent in combat. I remember AMC showing this movie and the host commenting that Audie Murphy went thru a lot trying to get his book on the screen. Basically, they sanitized and cleaned everything up to the point where if you were young enough, you might think war is not that bad even if you get killed. I have had a copy of the book for about 20 years and have read it about 3 times, viewing the movie once ws enough for me. It is amazing how "all is quiet on the western front" made much earlier when standards were even more rigid was able to pack a bigger punch, make a point and be more satisifying than this watered-down mess. Get the book, wait for the movie to come on TV 
 I bought this book when I first started sitting. It was too vague and not very helpful 
 I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it 
 Does anyone even care that the "Author" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.  This book is Propaganda. Period 
 A really poor writer.  Nothing new hear.  A good book to use as a paper weight 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.  This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.    Brian DeDentro (Rhode Island College 
 If your health is your concern then this awful little book misses by a mile.  It has always amazed me the number of people who profess to draw conclusions from evidence but have no basic mastery of critical thinking or logic.  It is as if they skipped or failed that class in college but decided they were smart enough that it didn't matter.  Mr. Richards' book is a poster child for failed logic, opinion masquerading as fact and belief in the written word regardless of source.  The only thing he lacks is a chapter on who shot JFK. (...I read on the net the Skull and Bones was involved and the CIA covered it up)  That said when he does feign to discuss health issues instead of dubious political history he does provide some useful information.  (Maybe 3 chapters out of 24)   The only good news here is that Mel Gibson should be available to do the film as Conspiracy Theory II.  Don't waste your time or your money; at least not until the screenplay comes out 
 I was happy at first that my wife had bought this book.  At first, I thought it would be good for her to understand me.  Then, I asked her if I could read it, and was strongly irritated at the generalizations and  labeling that were used.  The fault in this book lies in the way the author  drew a box around his picture of men, and made it seem as though all men  are that way.  I was most strongly irritated at his chapter on temptation.   In fact, according to him, I would either be a homosexual or a liar, since  I have not ever looked at another woman with sexual thoughts.  I have,  indeed, struggled with same sex desires, but being a homosexual is living  the lifestyle.  This was definitely not the book for my wife and I, who  were desperately trying to understand each other.  I am a man who is  definitely outside this author's idea of what men are like.  I am deeply  sensitive, creative, romantic, and do not fall into his categorization.  I  wish I could find an author who realizes that men are changing.  We are not  the same men that were here 50 years ago.  We are becoming more open and  more sensitive.  Unfortunately, many men think that they have to be the way  this book says we are, because the author makes them think that it's the  norm.  I give the author one star for good intentions 
 I got this DVD for $1.99 and I still feel ripped off.  The quality of the movie was terrible, the story line was stupid, and the acting was just fair.  Do not waste your time on this poor movie.  Even though there are some stars in it in their younger days (Eloitt Gould, Michelle Piefer, David Caruso), it does not make up for the poor content of the movie.  Cheaply made---DON'T BOTHER!! 
 I saw this in a bin at Wal-mart for 2.99 and decide to get it since was 2.99.  Well, I want my money back.  No wonder I only remembered two songs from them Carmel and What would you do.  I would say get the singles to Carmel and call it a day.  I never liked What Would You Do because it was contradicting...guy at bachelor party see friend who is a stripper and tries to give her advice.  Wait..hello..you are were enjoying this lady removing clothes until you realized who it was.  The rest of the CD is slow and boring.  Claudette Ortiz has a great voice. She sort of sounds like Beyonce in songs 12 and 14 or vice versa.  Save your time, energy, and money on this Cd and enjoy these when they are played on the radio.  
 Stop !  This may look cute, but any amount of playing (even breathing on it) will cause it to fall apart.  This toy did not last a month in our house.  It never stayed together, and on top of that it comes with about 20 teeny tine "grooming pieces" (not kidding, most a smaller than a dime) Definitely a major disappointment for my daughters who love strawberry shortcake and horses 
 I bought this book hoping for a Christian perspective on the Christian-themed The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown.  What I paid for is unabashed preaching on how the Gospel can be spread through never re-interpretting or revisiting the collection of stories called the Bible.    These two theological scholars don't add any additional light to Brown's story nor do they actually show proof that the DaVinci Code couldn't have been true (which, in fact, I agree that most of Brown's work is fictional interpretation.)   It seems like another opportunity for Christians to talk to themselves and reinforce a narrow viewpoint through villianizing the "mass media" and the general population.  Pure back-patting fluff 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 tHE WORST OF THE WORST I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER LOOSE MY TIME IN SUCH A WAY. 
 I don't know about this book!  I wouldn't recommend i 
 The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!!  and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!!   I only gave it 1 star because the review process doesn't have a 0 stars.  DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS THING!!!! 
 Hamid Algar is a passionate Sufi - and he has the right to be one. However it is important to understand that this book is merely his polemical attack against a group that criticizes the ideas of his own sect. The book is dismaly small, and full of stereotypical over-generalizations that are typically found in Western sources. As is typical with books about 'Wahhabis', it rarely quotes the works of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab directly.  Definitely not a scholarly work, but one which summarizes the anti-Wahhabist view of Wahhabism.   If you want to read this work, keep these points in mind, and also read Natana D. Bas's work Wahhabi Islam. That is more sympathetic, and has plenty of quotes from the writings of the founder 
 I've never been a big fan of live albums. Frankly, I don't see a point in buying what are basically poorly-recorded, often sloppy versions of songs I've heard already. "Evilive" is really no exception. Why pay 16 bucks for double-speed versions of old Misfits songs, the only addition being some guys yelling in the background?   The songs that were chosen to be on this album are great songs, but new Misfits fans should buy Collection I or II if they're looking for the best of the Misfits all in one place. I would have only given "Evilive" one star, but I added a second one just because of Henry Rollins' hilarious guest vocal on "We Are 138. 
 Rather than a concise history of the Middle East this book offers only 146 pages of brief summary of outside powers effects on the region.  This isn't a history of the Middle East, it's a history of how Europe, the US and the Soviet Union interacted with the Middle East. Though undeniably important in understanding the region, Western and Eastern relations with the Middle East are not the only reasons for studying it. There is more going on, far more, that Shlaim does not address, and it opens a large crediblility gap.  What is missing? A lot.  This might be a good book if it's only goal were to teach people a very concise history of Western and Eastern relations to the Middle East, so perhaps it is just poorly titled. The information that it did offer though seemed good enough, and it provided a fair overview of US relations with the Middle East, but I expected more and was dissapointed 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 I received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). I came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem I know not to waste my money. They are very unique and I do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality 
 If you'd like a glossed over review of making a movie this might interest you but if you have any knowledge about the abyss, its creatures or the vents which have been known now for more than 25 years, this book will leave you disappointed. The few images of the creatures are poor, especially when taken by a 70mm IMAX which is 4 times the size of a 35mmm slide. The lack of creatures shown, the poor descriptions of them , etc. make for armchair reading that will put you to sleep unless you're enthralled by the California mystique of a director's name and little substance. I doubt I'll see the film either. When I buy something about the sea or other natural subjects I expect to learn something from it, not be poorly entertained. The references to Europa and its possible ocean are interesting but would go better with a book of some substance about its main subject 
 Although I do credit this book with whetting my appetite to research further into Lilith and I did enjoy reading it when I first started it, after I did more research myself, I realized how flawed Koltuv's research  is. She makes assertions while giving no evidence (such as stating that  Lilith appears in Germanic mythology, which she doesn't), and she throws a  lot of non-Lilith myths, stories, etc., that are similar to Lilith but  treats them as if they are actually directly connected instead of just  being "archetypally" connected. She also makes the usual claim  that Lilith was originally a goddess, and, per usual, gives no evidence for  this assertion. This is an OK intro to Lilith book and is a fun read, but  do your serious research into Lilith elsewhere 
 This book is very poorly written. For historical fiction it is extremely boring and the plot is shallow and predictable. The characterers are ridiculous. Hake tried to create characters that are endearing, but they turned out iritating especially the hero, Josh McCain. The O'Sullivans had a bit of charm, but not enough to carry the book. Don't waste your time 
 this book makes a point and drives it home over and over (and over) again.  While it was a stunning revelation that restricted communities were actually the norm during the first half of the 20th century, rather than the exception, the author pounded it home without speaking about the repercussions of such covenants: Inner cities destroyed, ghettoization, crime, and life in the burbs turned out to be a dubious gift, at best.  America is now plagued with obesity, depression, pollution, and all around stupidity, because of moving people so far apart from each other and the services they need to live.   This author could have well spent more time looking at the bigger picture, rather than beating us with one fact 
 Please take this horrible misrepsentation off of your web site, or at the very least practice honesty in advertising. This unit is so small that all it good for is ties, shorts and socks. I feel violated by Amazon and Conair 
 This Book belabors the obvious and is very light on detail oriented, usable information.  General overview is good, but you can tell that this person does not have any hands on experience with the subject matter 
 This was on television earlier today. It's a horribly dated film. Bad pacing, bad music, with not much of a plot. Also, I'd suggest not eating at Dante's. And please, try not to kill the messengers 
 Trust me. I went through many Exchange server books and I am an experienced system admin and Exchange admin. This book is the worst book for technical people. The concept in the book is for readers who are most likely a non-technical managers who want to have an overall knowledge about Exchange. If you touch Exchange server, do not read this book and waste your time. Go with Exchange 24/7 which is much better 
 The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst 
 ashlee's recent face lift and apparent nose job is proof that's she's all plastic and no talent. she must of asked the Dr to make her look like her sister. very sad cause she's unrecognizable now. better looking, maybe, still can't sing or dance. 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 Take a close look at the sample recipes:  they are full of onion. Something entirely unsafe to feed your cat.  This is not possibly a vet-approved book 
 Have you ever seriously regretted spending money on a book that you thought was terrible? If so, congratulations! You know how I feel. This book was lame, lame, lame. It was sooooo boring! I was actually about halfway through this book when I got bored with it and stopped reading it. It was probably three months later when I picked it back up again to finish it. Then I kinda wished I hadn't. This was like reading an attempt by your 14-year-old friend to write a novel. Man, I could have written this book! I felt like I had heard this same story like fifteen times before. I gave this book 2 stars because some of it was kinda cute, but it was so unoriginal. I have a feeling that the same problem is going to overtake teen fiction for girls in the future 
 The key concept of this book is the existence of a new Creative Class. Richard throws into the Creative Class almost everybody and groups them in two categories: the Super Creative Core and the "creative professionals". These two groups include: scientists, professors, poets, novelists, artists, entertainers, actors, designers, architects, non-fiction writers, editors, cultural figures, researchers, analysts, programmers, engineers, filmmakers, financial services, legal and health care professionals, business management and the list goes on.  The problem is that the definition of this class is so loose. Even Richard admits that the definition is not really clear, but he goes on discarding the importance of rigour. A class must have political alignment as an expression of a common ground in the way wealth is created and distributed. It should be reflected in the way people vote; otherwise the class does not make sense. It is difficult to convince anyone that you can put these people in the same class: engineers and artists, accountants and actors.   The book uses shocking statistics and quotes and then follows through with flashy language to wrap up a nicely packaged chapter. The problem is that the book has enough time to loose the reader after seemingly never ending debates. This book has so much information and so little structure. All those tables are useless because they do not support a coherent system of principles or story. The writing is difficult to read and very repetitive. After the first fifty pages the same arguments are being rotated again and again: creativity is important, the time of agriculture has passed, the heavy industry is not important for global leadership, there is tension between individual freedom and corporation rigidity, etc.   In describing the new class, Richard Florida observes that "Fewer than one-quarter of all Americans (23.5 percent) accounted for by the 2000 Census lived in a 'conventional' nuclear family, down from 45 percent in 1960. This is social group is mentioned many times in the book. By contrast, the family social group is almost completely ignored. I have the impression that this is actually the creative class and all these indexes (Bohemian, Single, Gay, etc) match quite well the group's dynamics.   I gave this book a two stars rating purely on style and clarity and overall coherence of the book. I think that regardless of the political affiliation, the reader will have genuine difficulty in following the book from the beginning to the end. For instance, in discussing the transformations of every day life, in a polemic with other authors Richard says:   "Juxtaposed to this view are those who believe technology and unbridled market forces are making us work harder and faster, leaving us less time to enjoy each other and out interests, destroying human connections and damaging our neighbourhoods and communities. If the techno-utopians romanticize the future, these techno pessimists glorify the past. Unfettered hypercapitalism is leading to the end of work and the demise of high paying, secure jobs, according to social critics like Jeremy Rifkin. Worse yet, the elimination of such jobs destroy an important source of social stability, argues Richard Sennett, casting people adrift, corroding our collective character and damaging the very fibre of society. The workplace is evolving into an increasingly stressful and dehumanizing "white-collar sweatshop" in Fill Fraser's view, beset by long hours and chronic overwork. In the eyes of cultural critic Tom Frank, business has become an all-powerful and hegemonic cultural force, as entities like MTV and The Gap turn alternative-culture symbols into money making devices. Neighbourhoods, cities and society as a whole are losing the strong sense of community and civic-minded spirit that were the source of our prosperity, argues Robert Putnam. In his nostalgia for a bygone era of VFW halls, bowling leagues, Cub Scout troops and Little League, Putnam contends that the demise of these repositories of `social capital' is the source of virtually all of our woes..."  If you were able to read the text above without losing your concentration and you remembered what started it, then you might be able to read the book and even like it.  Otherwise you will probably find that after you read page after page you realise your thoughts were wondering somewhere else. You come back, re-read those pages, only to find you lost your thoughts again.  
 I really wanted to like this book, because I've loved all her other books. However, the usual magic just wasn't there.  I felt Regina had serious issues that should have at least been talked out with Blue concerning his "mission" and instead there are just alot of doubts that she has that they never really address. They have a five minute conversation, but not the kind of talk a woman has with a man who is the father of her child who is doing things that could land him in jail (b/c lets face it, as poetic as it is, it's also illeagal and if some of the thugs he takes out wanted some revenge, it wouldn't be impossible to get...which is the kind of thing a woman should consider when she's contemplating raising a child in that environment) Secondly, with the exceptions of Blue, Abby, Peaches, and Regina, there just aren't any real sympathetic characters. You have the trifling brother army deserter, the General who is clearly losing his grip on reality a little more each day, the dirty cop, crooked politicians, the loving husband who's secretly [...] and frequents many DL nights at clubs, and the stripper with the heart of gold....wait, wrong novel, i mean the stripper/[...]who's mostly motivated by money and a desire to go to vegas. It's just pages and pages of losers justifying their selfish, irrational, and/or dangerous behavior. And the whole relationship between General, Blue's Mom, and the stripper? Just sick. I go to Miss Cleage's books, because as a 19 year old black female, its good to see books where black people have hope and act like real people instead of wannabe thugs and/or people who are acting like they just got out of Africa the other day and slavery just ended two hours ago. I mean, respect the past but it's time to move on to gather our strength as a psople and rise. And usually her books give me that, but this time there was nobody for me to really cheer for. Although Blue's vision, and the way he made people get respect by forcing them to act in a way that garners respect was pretty awesome 
 and he's a super-talented drummer. The day the Foos release a best-of compilation I'll probably pick it up. Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill "alternative" rock. Only "Stacked Actors" has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. "Learn to Fly," the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous.  Foo Fighters HAVE made some really good songs, like "Everlong." But I honestly don't think they'd be nearly as big if Grohl hadn't drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands of all time, NIRVANA. Elsewhere, their fantastic cover versions such as Gary Numan's "Down in the Park" and Prince's "Darling Nikki" suggest they are great rockers but less great in the songwriting department 
 Don't see this. see the version with Jackie Chan. It is much more exiting because there is karate. Plus the new version with jackie is hillarious. nice and crud 
 this is a sad attempt for the Liars at taking their sound in a new direction. It comes off as a hearted rip off of "Animal Collective's" "Feels" album, which was amazing. This disc doesn't live up to the hype surrounding it, and conventional wisdom is starting to tell me that Pitchfork has gotten too big for there britches 
 This book should never have been re-released.  It is that bad.  Save your time, money, and vision.  None of the characters are believable or likeable.  Meredith's story might have worked if she made her vengeful return to Billings after 10 or 15 years instead of 6.  I have been in the boardroom of a national corporation and 22 year old mothers do not have the depth and experience to head a domestic division even with an MBA.  Not to mention her unfamiliarity with society and lack of professional allies in this rags to riches story.    Cy is totally appalling.  Why would anyone trust him in business or in bed?   And yet our heroine falls for him over and over again.  How stupid.  How could he live with his mother for 30 some years and never ask about his grandmother or his relatives?  How could everyone in town have forgotten who she was if she grew up there?  And what about the mysterious Mr. Smith?  Although called a bodyguard, he acted only as a babysitter.  He could have been interesting.  Wasn't he worth a story line?  He did not even rate a first name.  Unbelievable.  This book was too, painfully long with characters I never cared about.  It was torture to read.  Even the sex was bad.  For people whose attraction was based on mutual passion it just came across as horny sex.  Put this one back in mothballs.  And Diana, do not be afraid to write about a mature woman.  Love and sexual satisfaction can still be a discovery for women over 35 
 Goldwater's disastorous 1964 Presidential campaign is the vehicle for telling the book's real story: the rise of the ultra-conservative movement in American politics in the sixties. It is undoubtedly an important story, and one that Perlstein has researched considerably. However, Perlstein's work is undone not by his findings, or his damaging portrayal of the burgeoning right-wing movement -- I concur with him on these points -- but by very lazy presentation. Perlstein has obvioulsy drunk deep at the David Halberstam well. He can rattle off an anecdote, but he is dreadfully prolix. The book is at least two hundred pages too long. No reader opening a book on sixties politics needs an eight-hundred word summary of Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Perlstein has also made a mess in organising his material; he leaps back and forth, from person to person, without ever stitching the requisite parts together. One moment Henry Cabot Lodge looks to be the certain favourite for the 1964 Republican nomination, and we are treated to fifteen pages on the organisation of his campaign; later we are told, almost as an aside, that he has withdrawn from the race, and Perlstein never explains why. Sam Tannehaus's 'Whittaker Chambers' is a much more assured analysis of the growth of anti-communist hysteria in the fifties and sixites, and is considerably shorter and better crafted than Perlstein's book. A more thorough editor and an author more intent on telling the story carefully and well would have made 'Before the Storm' a much better book than it is 
 I happened upon this book in the bookstore, and also recently saw it mentioned in Harper's Bazar.  All they say is that it is a "comprehensive history of footware."  What they fail to mention is that all the pictures are illustrations.  There is not one single color photograph of an original shoe.  If you check the product description above that Amazon provides, it does tell you that it has illustrations, but many people don't know to look there.   While the drawings are nicely done, they didn't give me the same thrill that seeing an actual photo of an original shoe would have.  The pictures on the cover are exactly the same type of drawing and the same type of composition that you will see of other shoes in the book.  I can understand having drawings of shoes from hundreds of years ago, but not having any photos of modern shoes seems a cop out.  The book is informative, but I think it is in no way "complete." It gives an overview of shoes from different eras, but does not scratch much beyond the surface. So, you get a little of everything and some representative pictures of the average footware, but not a good sense of what might be unique about a particular time period beyond what you can see for yourself in the illustrations.   I've read other books on fashion history that do a better job than this book in covering a wide range of time periods (such as Decades of Beauty).  However, these books did not contain only shoes.  I have yet to find a book about shoes that has both good photographs and informative text.    So, due to lack of competition, some people may want to check this book out because there isn't anything else out there.  But, I would not reccomend buying it sight unseen.  I think that this book would be too elementary for a fashion historan or someone into the history of shoes, but too boring for the average person to want to buy.  I definitely would not recommend it for someone with a shoe fetish.  It was worth the time I spent looking through it at the bookstore because of some of the text, but mostly because of the lack of photos I did not buy it 
  This is pure hype. Peter Kelder never wrote a book called Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth. It's title is The Eye of Revelation and has been published by Borderland Sciences since as early at 1975. These rites are very effective. There has been some recent research into what makes these simple exercises so powerful.   It is just my opinion, but if you want to stay on track it is best to go withthe original publishers on this one and explore how an entire collection of scientific material hangs together. There is a depth to these exercises that can be reached only with a little research

 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 Whatever it Takes...  This movie was not even worth my time in watching it.  I even heard it was so good I bought it and I hate it!  I love teen/romance movies but this one was not one I will ever watch again and struggled to get through the first time!  Reading the synopsis will let you know just what the plot of this movie is.  My thoughts skip this one all together.  
 This is what occured when I heard this album. I immediately had to run to the bathroom and crap my life out. And guess what?!?!?!?!?! There was blood in my stool. Damn you jeffery for polluting this world with your awful lyrics, curse you for wasting beats, and shame on you for calling this album "blood in my eye" when you don't even know the history behind the book called "blood in my eye". Listen to us Ja quit rapping and go work at kfc 
 In all fairness I was looking for a different book -- when I got this in the mail it wasn't what I expected.  Though the title would have you believe it would be a suitable replacement.  I was planning to drive from LA to San Diego and was looking for some cool landmarks.  Well each state gets 2 pages, so you can image the ideas I got for stopping points.  Zero.  I looked up Massachusetts, my home, and all it seemed to talk about was Howard Johnson's.  Given HoJo's has burned a place in local memory and was an important early player in the motel business,  no evidence exists of it today.  So bad road trip book.  Mildly interesting history book 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 Jeffrey Gitomer makes some good points but nothing I haven't seen before in his weekly columns or "Sales Caffeine".  I was surprised at how short/small the book was and even more surprised when I saw the extensive use of large fonts, short chapters and wide margins.  This is more like an 75 page book - not 130.  The main thing that I got out of it was a desire to learn more about John Patterson -- he was an intriguing guy 
 How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of tim 
 After watching Mr. Feinberg being interviewed on television I was most anxious to read his book. It goes without saying that the topic is both fascinating and poignant. However, given that the author is extremely distinguished I was perplexed as to why he felt the need to continually bombard the reader with his credentials. I felt quite bogged down with his repeated self-aggrandizing and was rather turned off. He came across as very caring and obviously intelligent during the television interview so I can only conclude he communicates better orally than in written word 
 It was in great condition.  However, the package that it was shipped in was not in good condition.  I would have used a box instead of an envelope

 This is one of those "it's so bad it's not good but passes as funny".  The one note jokes about Dolly's you know whats promote groans, but the guys will like them.  But, I discovered Richard Farnsworth!  What a handsome older man with piercing blue eyes!  Sadly, he's passed away since, but I've really enjoyed his performance in other movies like "Misery".  Enjoy 
 It is unfortunate that there is no good history of the Hmong published in any Western language.  Keith Quincy must be commended on his effort, but it is disappointing.  He is not a professional historian.  The first chapter  in particular, ostensibly dealing with the Hmong experience in China, shows  his unfamiliarity with Chinese history and inability to use Chinese  sources.  (The story of the "Hmong" king's defeat by China  actually concerns the conquest of the Jinchuan people, who were not Hmong.)   Quincy uncritically uses an unreliable account by F. Savina, _Histoire des  Miao_ (Hong Kong, 1924).  For a better study of Hmong in China see Robert  Jenks, _Insurgency and Social Disorder in Guizhou_ (University of Hawaii  Press, 1994).  The rest of the book is a little better, but must be read  with caution and cross-checked with other sources 
 I went through this cookbook after going through the new Southern Living Slow Cooker Cookbook and what a disappointment! Not only does this book use many pre-packaged items (if I'm making it myself, I'd rather not use that junk), the recipes were dull. Almost every recipe was in the other cookbook and was MUCH better. I also purchased the More Betty Crocker Slow Cooker Recipes and MANY of the recipes were the same--picture and all! What a waste of money. Purchase the new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook and you'll be MUCH happier 
 This book was difficult to read for a few reasons.  At times, the narrator, Lee, makes observations about her prep school surroundings, or describes an uncomfortable situation, that we can all painfully relate to.  She reminded me of a part of myself that I would rather not be reminded of.  At other times, she is just downright pathetic.  Her insecurity borders on the pathological, she has no real personality, and she is introverted to such an extreme that after a while you, as the reader, completely lose touch with her.  There were moments when I wanted to slap her on the head and tell her to "snap out of it!"  I think she is trying to paint herself as the poor, misunderstood misfit.  But in this case, still waters most definitely do not run deep.    I didn't find this book slow or boring, it was actually fairly easy to get through.  I just realized throughout the course of the book that I really disliked the narrator.  Some of her traits were just inexcusable, and others reflected the darker side of all of us, but virtually none of her traits were positive or redeeming in any way 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...  Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.  Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?  Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.  (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art. 
 I enjoy reading wiewpoints that vary in scope since all stories have two sides. This author's pretext leads us into his ideology with surreptitious restraint. But, the anti-Jew, brown, and black sentiment is pouring out by the second chapter.  Steele writes well and his ability to put together thoughts and list supportive data offers compelling credence to his white separatist resolve...especially if you're a white man.  The book is an enlarged pamphlet, a trojan horse designed to broaden the whole "White" defense idea and get it out on the coffee table.  Personally,I find it too much to digest without chocking on some of the strong anti-everyone else sentiment that takes over by the second chapter. I like middle-ground. I'm an optimist and not a fatalist. I dislike having extremists sneak up on me whether they be pro-white, anti-white, pro-God or anti-God, pro-meat, or vegan.  I felt that way after turning a few pages of this book which turned me off to it.  Since I paid for the book, I guess I'm entitled to an opinion.     
 Besides pretty much knowing the ending shortly after the beginning, the movie is just dumb. The characters for the most part are flat, the twists are unbelievable, and everything in the story lacks any reality. The incredibly high tech bank is run on a rack of pc equipment, but somehow is now run remotely and all of the maintenance terminals are missing. As if the full rack of gear needs some green screens in order to work. Sorry. Then of course the hackers need to do a home invasion in order to get physical access to the system. Hmm. And then they take several days, only to stumble when the maintenance terminals are missing. So, in a flash of brilliance Harrison Ford rips out the scanning bar from an all in one printer and plugs it into an ipod. And then tapes it to the screen so that they can capture the screen output. Because everyone knows most people like to watch numbers scroll on the screen and there is no such thing as cat or pipes. But, if you believe you can pull some stuff out of a printer and click it into your ipod and suddenly have a portable text capture device, well i guess the rest of it makes sense. but then, the wireless video cameras all had fisheye lenses. which makes sense because there is a wireless toy car that takes all of them out temporarily, since it obviously uses the same frequency. which we know because in the beginning of the movie it causes huge interference on a computer screen. since after all, most computer screens connect to the pcs using a wireless transmitter. that cable you plug in the back is really just an antenna. and you will believe that only bad guys get hurt when automatic weapons spray buildings and older computer guys can beat the crud out of younger armed psychopathic criminals with british accents. And that there is great wireless coverage throughout the empty areas of washington state, so that you can drive in a car with your laptop and have constant internet access.   so, what was there to like in the movie? hmm. it was consistent. nothing made much sense from the start to the end. oh, and one of the computer guys looked like he actually could be a computer guy. but of course he was killed for being nice. or in the way. or whatever.  watch bladerunner for the 15th time instead. 
 My first clue should have been the reviews on the back, which appear to all be quotes from people who owe Froelich a favor for having been mentioned in her column or who expect to get a mention for talking up her book.  If you want some interesting gossip, the inside scoop on some of yesterday's news, read this book.  It's a quick, easy read and has a few amusing and/or eye-popping moments (I don't think I'll ever be able to eat Altoids again).  The trouble is Froelich didn't narrow her focus enough.  Part of her wanted to dish on the NY gossip scene and tell you how to get a foot into the world of the glitterati, and part of her wanted to give practical advice to Joe Midwest who wants to know how to get good PR for his local business.  She slips in a few quick tips and examples for Joe (who, let's face it, is far more likely to be considering this book just by sheer virtue of the fact that we're all more likely to be him than up and coming glitterati), but not enough or in enough detail to make it truly worthwhile.  Meanwhile, the ending drops off like she suddenly got tired of the whole project or had to leave in a rush to cover the Pitt/Aniston divorce.  My advice: do like I did and check this one out of the local library if you're interested; don't spend your hard earned cash 
 Don't buy songs from this racist bastard!!!! And if he so-call "hates everyone", why does most of his titles of his b-side songs start with the "N" word? Damn hick 
 Andrew Sinclair's tedious and pompous book about the supposed discovery of America by his ancestors, the Sinclairs of the Orkney Islands, and his supposed discovery of the Holy Grail. is the closest thing to saying he has found the Lockness monster. This pseudo-scientific bunch of baloney never should have been published. God only knows why it was. If this is all Sinclair can produce these days, he should pack it in and take up checkers.  Chess would be too challenging 
 Mr. Ballard's novel CONCRETE ISLAND starts out somewhat promising, with a successful English salaryman unintentionally finding himself trapped beneath a freeway overpass. What could have been an interesting study on modern alienation becomes a bizarre parody of Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN, with the George Milton character supplanted by a teenage runaway. An incredibly frustrating novel that sucks you in with promises of something better but never delivers 
 As a longtime Patriots fan living outside of New England, I was hoping that this book would provide me with inside information that I was missing out on without the local media focus. It was inspiring reliving the first Super Bowl victory over St. Louis, but overall it was dissapointing. There were a lot of interesting specific antecdotes (most notably the Tom Jackson exchange), but nothing that really surprised me and no real in-depth analysis of their winning ways.  The structure and grammar of the book are also quite poor. Although the book was short, it was not that easy to read as I had to continuously re-read passages to understand who the author was talking about or when the event was occuring 
 The premise of this book is to reveal the 8 secrets of how ordinary people became successful investors.  Yet there really are no secrets revealed.  The whole book is basically one big, thinly disguised advertisement for the author's financial advisory services.  One of the secrets in the book is to devote less than three hours per month to personal finances, and that includes paying bills.  I fail to see how that is "secret" that will ever help anyone get a handle on their finances. While the author encourages readers not to spend any time reading up on personal finances, the book is filled with comments about how the smartest thing many of the author's clients ever did was getting a financial advisor.  So evidently the path to financial success, according to the author, is to not read anything about personal finances on your own and instead pay someone else to do all of the financial thinking and planning for you.  I don't think anyone with any basic logic skills would believe this is really true. If you want a good book on how ordinary people really became wealthy, I'd recommend reading the Millionaire Next Door instead.       
 This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as "this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.  Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough "zingers" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.    Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.  I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a "deadly" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  "Milliseconds" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.    Is this "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
 This book was extremely disappointing.  It is not written or illustrated by the creators of the Magic School Bus series and it is obvious from page one.  There are none of the informative side bars (papers, etc. "written" by the kids in the story) and the information is not as complete.  This alone makes the book less appealing than the originals, but to top it off, the children in the book bicker and compete with each other and are not supportive or respectful.  
 Don't be fooled by the description - this trike does NOT come with a pushbar, nor does it appear to be compatible with a pushbar.  After contacting Amazon, they offered to let us disassemble it to send it back and they would send us another of the same model, which doesn't solve our problem.  It looks beautiful and assembled fairly easily though, if you are looking for a nice trike without a pushbar 
 This is the perfect book if you bought your tivo brand new over two years ago and have not upgraded to series 2.  Alot of the Hacks are Hints and Tricks you already know if you are an experienced Tivo user of at least one day.  It is pretty much useless for Series 2 Tivo's. I will be returning mine and buy the von hagen book. Shame on you O'reilly, usually you put out really good books 
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 This is unreadable.  Go find someting else.  Quickly.  Notice how the people who review this book are directly polarized - they love it or hate it.  If you love Graham's stuff, go for it, you won't be disappointed.  But if you're not a Graham fan stay away.  If you're looking to read her for the first time, try Swarm, it's cleaner and more accessible 
 First off, I subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years, and enjoyed it. But the "main guy" Robert Kennedy, is someone who offends me both personally and politically. He assumes that every girl/women reading that magazine is tiny. For his information, some of us work out 5-6 days a week and eat well, and are still heavy-set. His comments on heavy-set people are offensive, thoughtless, and sometimes even downright cruel. Nonetheless, the pictures/articles were inspiring to me, and it is a decent fitness magazine 
 I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD, (one fewer thing to carry).  Well, about six months after opening this item, I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery.  One of the contacts had broken, and the device was not working anymore.  I am disappointed, but should have expected that for the $10 I spent.  
 Don't make the mistake of judging the entire Hard Case Crime series by this lackluster entry.  I can imagine the publishers being overjoyed when Stephen King agreed to write a novel for them and then cringing when they received this manuscript.  The writing is fine, as you'd expect from King, but there's nothing remotely hard-boiled or sexy in this novel.  (Don't let the cover fool you!)  It's simply the meandering story of an apparent murder that happened years before.  There are a couple of interesting hooks, but they certainly don't lead anywhere.  This one's for Stephen King completists only.  
 I have to say that I found this book a bit of a disappointment especially having read the author's comment "if you were to purchase just one book on Irish Families, I have written this work for you". In fact if  this the only book you consult on Irish families you will be most upset.  The book makes the mistake of trying to reinvent the wheel by cataloging  families from old data sources. This has already been done, much better, by  several other authors. For the most prominent families, this publication  adds nothing to the existing knowledge base. It's attempt to include rare  names is honorable, but the amount of information provided is scant, at  best. For example, "The family of Mulvey is traditionally linked to  Co. Leitrim and it has remained so in modern times" hardly does  justice to this once great sept. The entries are also inconsistent, for  some the Irish form of the name is included and for others it is not. I  would have expected all of the old Gaelic names to have their Irish form  included. The coats of arms are a real let down, not only are they in  monochrome (colour is the essence of heraldry), but the quality of  reproduction is poor. It would have been better to leave them out  altogether. There are also quite a few errors and omissions (though the  author does admit this at the start). One that stuck me was the list of  Jewish-Irish names which omits the most famous of all, Briscoe. A look at  the entry for Briscoe shows no mention of the family's Jewish heritage,  despite the fact that at least members of the family have had high  political profiles in Dublin. The book claims Flaherty and Laverty as the  same name and while this is true in terms of their root word origin in  Irish, the names are racially quite distinct. In another case the book  fails to link the two names Haughey and Haffey. I found the book too  heavily reliant on "Keating's History", which while excellent, is  far from the only source available. Another off-putting aspect is the fact  that the names are not listed in proper alphabetical order and names  beginning with "B" crop up among the "A's" and so on.  On the plus side, the book does include a lot of information and it is not  expensive as such publications go. In short, this is not a book for  one-name researchers but should be on the shelves of all with a general  interest in Irish names 
 PROS: 1. John Corey is still a funny, memorable character.  CONS: 1. Very little suspense. The author's use of a doomed character's point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villain's Dr. Evil-esque plan ("FIRE THE NUKE!"). Then, after we know everything, we get plopped back into the first-person, investigative head of Corey, who doesn't yet have the story solved. The result is predicatable and tedious.  2. The don't-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?) use of the Ted Nash character, who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and, uh, THE LION'S GAME. Why is Ted's appearance so brief here? Well, he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield. Naturally, Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets. Presumably, Ted's dead for good now.   3. The politics of DeMille's novels has been present in other books, but it's never been this catty. Why is the nuke kook a right-winger? (Hey, why not?) I should have known when the jacket cover said the book "will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country." The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.    4. Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all. Yep, they are bothered by 9/11, but they are both working their same jobs, apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the "accident" of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile. There is passing reference to this, but not much. Apparently, a guy like Corey doesn't do much soul searching. He just keeps going to work. In realilty, it's hard not to notice that DeMille still doesn't know how to deal with the storytelling hole he got himself in with the last book.  Corey is really all this book has going for it. And, while in his capable hands the world will be saved from kooky nuclear schemes from kooky Republicans, he can't save this book.  I think I'm done with DeMille, for better or for worse 
 Basically that is what I was asking myself through the entire book. What is going ON? I dunno, something abt a typhoon and these two gay guys on a ship I think ... Conrad needed a therapist. I think he was confused 
 On the face of it i would say it is pretty bad. Presentation, presentors, dance instruction all are lacking for a dvd expected to reach a wide audience. The set was a tropical scene done with a blue screen, the danceers didn't actually demonstrate with music so one could not get a feel for the timing, the lead male presentor prefixed every move taught with the dvd title and his name which got so annoying to the point of amusement. The lady Iwatched part of it with ended up by laughing and asking me to take it out and put in another dvd. I haven't watched the whole thing needless to say but i will revisit it at another stage to give it the beneit of the doubt.  I would say buy another series 
 Sounds exciting, but actually, well, boring, mostly because the author  fails to distinguish between two very different claims:  first, that  boredom, the state of mind, didn't exist until recently, and second, that  it wasn't talked about much until recently.  The first claim would be  exciting and bizarre, but the argument at most supports the second 
 Granted, I love plane crash video because it is my secret creepy obsession, so almost any footage is pretty okay by me, but this video was terrible.  There were mistakes in identifying some of the planes, and really, if I wanted to know about military jets, I'd watch the history channel.  Not to sound morbid or anything, but I was hoping for a lot more flaming wreckage 
 Great design but unfortunately wouldn't stay stuck in cold temperatures - I have a Saturn and the vent clip was not an option for me 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 This is a fine book if you want to see what someone very smart has to say about Machiavelli's major works.  What I wanted, however, was to understand the context in which Machiavelli wrote, and I would have loved to get some information on how and why his ideas began to have influence beyond Florence.  If you understand references to the founding of Rome, to 15th century Papal politics, and have a good grounding in Livy, this book is for you.  If, like me, what you wanted from a introduction to Machiavelli was to have someone explain Machiavelli's context and allusions, look elsewhere 
 This book is rife with inaccuracies.  Bonnie and Clyde were not killed May 23, 1935 but May 23, 1934.  Clyde's head was not "unrecognizable".  I've seen the autopsy photos and, he's a mess, but he still looks like Clyde.  Two lawmen, not three, were killed by the Barrow gang April 6, 1934.  There's no real evidence that Bonnie participated in the murders (the single eyewitness changed his story several times under police pressure).  Bonnie's famous "cigar pose" was left behind after the Joplin shootout on April 13, 1933 so the photo isn't from 1934 as our author claims.  And, the most glaring error, the Bonnie and Clyde ambush was arranged by Henry Methvin and his father Ivan, not W. D. Jones.  These are the errors I found on one (!) page of a 229 page book 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 Another Capitol twofer, this one pairs the blatant marketing release, "Little Deuce Coupe" with the somewhat improved "All Summer Long".  "Little Deuce Coupe" consists of a few older tracks paired with eight hastily recorded songs-- the older stuff is available on other albums, the newer stuff, with a couple exceptions, is largely forgettable.  The single mix of "Be True to Your School" (a bonus track on this twofer) is largely better than the album mix (although quite honestly, I don't really care for either), and even the great ballads like "Ballad of Ole' Betsy", "Car Crazy Cutie" (a great Dion and the Belmonts-style vocal arrangement) and "Spirit of America" (with a stunning Brian falsetto) are mangled by car-centric lyrics (the latter is actually strong enough to survive its lyrics).  A couple of the other pieces show signs of quick assembly-- "Cherry, Chery Coupe", "No-Go Showboat" and "Custom Machine" are largely forgettable and sound dated compared to contemporary Beach Boys material).  Somewhat more interesting is the albums ending-- a rewrite of the a capella "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" as "A Young Man Is Gone", but the Boys singing the original lyrics is available on the Smiley Smile/Wild Honey twofer and is vastly superior.  "All Summer Long" starts off significantly better and has a smaller amount of filler-- opening with the #1 single "I Get Around", the brilliantly-arranged "All Summer Long" (goofy lyrics aside) and a great cover of "Hushabye" featuring Brian's falsetto in its full power.  The album fizzles a bit in quality after this (the exception being the great ballad "Wendy"), with the retro lyric of "Do You Remember", the totally tacky "Drive-In" and the completely bizarre "Our Favorite Recording Sessions" studio goofing around being nearly unlistenable.  The bonus tracks, aside from the "Be True to Your School" single, are largely unmemorable, with "All Dressed Up For School" actually being pretty obnoxious.  Overall, there's a lot of great material here, but the filler really is overwhelming at times 
 The best thing about this book for me was that it was so short.  I really don't think I could have finished if it were any longer.  I just don't get it.  I found the book to be so simple that it was insulting.  I felt like I should have read this at about 10 years of age.  Profound? Hardly. Masterpiece? Certainly not.  The only impact that this book had on me was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about... and I am still working on that one 
 Does Prager really know anything about Judaism? He claims to be a scholar of the "Torah".  He irritates when he has the audacity to tell Christians about their own Faith. He wants to tell Bible believing Christians that their Jesus would love to see Tookie Williams executed. Can y'all believe this guy? 
 Why someone would chose these books is beyond me, especially when there are so many other good choices. Literature has an impact on people and the only impact I can imagine Junie having on others is negative.  My daughter's first grade teacher is reading the Stupid Smelly School Bus to her class right now. Wanting to be an involved parent, I borrowed a copy from the friend and read it too. Junie is a brat. She thinks like a brat and acts like a brat.   Our family says, "Thanks, but no thanks! 
 After blazing through the first two volumes, and halfway into the conclusion, my reading, and enjoyment of the series came to screeching halt.   Somewhere between the first page and 200 of the finale, Takeo and Kaede had became bumbling, inept and whining caracatures of themselves. WHAT happened to the strength and insight of the caracters I had learned to love? Their simpering and laughable "decisions" are a gross insult to the series...   Damn, and I was SO enjoying it too 
 Yes, T&C is the oldest continually published magazine in the USA, and it's their 160th anniversary. However, I see little reason to celebrate.  Why? Because I fail to see how it's really improved over the years.   Nowadays, this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the "nouveau riche". Back in the day when it was a true "high society" magazine, there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts, literature and culture. It was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to, but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about "bling bling", so has this magazine.    There are far too many adverts for so-called "luxury goods" for my tastes, and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new "power" base, they insist on using only THIN 20-something models who probably can't afford the clothes they are modeling!  Articles wise, they are starting to sound more like Glamour or Cosmo than the erudite publication I used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago.   Yes, T&C has changed with the times...but these are not good times if that is the case. It's too bad 
 This is a stupid book.  I got about half way through and stopped reading.  Blech.  Stilted language and not one character to root for.  The main character (Jane McGuire) is petulant, rude and for all her "worldliness" is very childish.  She seems to be constantly stamping her beautiful little foot and uttering "Damn you!!!"  She insists on doing as she pleases and all the responsible adults around her roll over, declare that she knows best, and allow her to do it.  And she is such an irresistible "woman" that 34 year old Mark Trevor salivates over her (this part is just weird) as do almost all of the other male characters.  And she is portrayed to be so much older than 20 year old Jock and 23 or so Mario.  Puh-lease.  Oh, yeah.  Ya gotta love how the ridiculous plot includes ancient treasure, international terrorism, and numerous references to 9/11 and Homeland Security.  Ooohh.  This is my first IJ book and surely my last.  I got to page 250 before bailing on it.  What was the publisher thinking 
 THIS Book is the size of a playing card and there is so little information in it PASS IT BY! 60 Little pages with a few sentences on each flower. The full color pictures just do not make up for what I thought would be Good reading. Give it away as a door prize 
 Extremely disappointing.  This is one of the most boring little books ever written.  If you are from New Orleans, you already know about local po-boy shops and the Mardi Gras Indians, etc.  If you're not, Piazza doesn't do a good enough job explaining the background of New Orleans customs and cultures.  It's all bread pudding and no reality of Hurricane Katrina.  This is such a short little book it shouldn't even have been published except perhaps in a local magazine.  Don't waste your time 
 Sorry.  I'm as big of a Bowie fan as anyone, but I have to be objective and honest: Bowie's output from 'Let's Dance' through this album, 'Earthling', just flat out sucked.  Sure, there were good tracks here and there, but Bowie's heart just seemed to not be in his music.  In the '70's, he changed from style-to-style and developed his reputation as a musical chameleon...but COMMITMENT was in each of those recordings.  Beginning with 'Let's Dance', it almost seemed as if he felt a need to constantly change to live up to his reputation and keep current and modern, but his head was somewhere else.  Take this album.  It's supposed to be club music and electronically-disco based, but that style combined with Bowie's Anthony Newley-styled vocals just clash and the overall effect is more irritating than enchanting.  The opening track, "Little Wonder", is such an alarming turn-off that it's hard not to turn the damn thing off without listening to the rest of the CD.  Thankfully, beginning with his next album, 1999's 'Hours', Bowie seemed content to accept his past, his legend and his legacy without having to jump aboard every musical trend that pops up.  The result has been three excellent albums in a row ('Hours', 'Heathen', and 'Reality') 
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 The book wasn't bad, but I felt was did not include enough variety.  How about detail on putting up flagstone, or putting rock on an existing wood frame house wall...  Still an interesting book and includes some neat info 
 I have read several "Powerful Profits" books by Victor H. Royer, and I can truly say he is one of the biggest phonies I've ever come across. I am in a state of shock that Midwest Gaming & Travel magazine could have hired this idiot. I am at an even further loss for words that Larry Grossman would invite Mr. Royer on his show, and seems to think he is a Gambling God.  Amazon.com has plenty of other books on Craps that are of a much higher caliber. (Especially the ones by Mr. Scoblete)  The problem with Mr. Royer is he has no understanding of even basic mathematics. In the back of his craps book he has a chapter entitled "The Big Secret", in which he attempts to prove that craps can be beaten by betting an intermediate progression on all 4 hardways bets. He lists 2 charts -- the first which shows the rolls of the sequence, the second which shows the size of the winning progression for each hardways bet, as well as the total amount won/lost for the sequence.  The problem is: his numbers don't add up.  Here's a quick example:  Let's say your betting $10 to win on hard 6. When EASY 6 comes in, you lose and now you press your bet to $11. Later in the sequence, easy 6 comes in again and you press your bet to $12. Now you craps out and the SEQUENCE ENDS.  When computing total loss for the sequence, Royer will include the $12, but will forget to include the $10 loss or the $11 loss.  And Royer screws this up for his entire chart, making the chart invalid, and the total loss $$$ invalid.  The hardways bets are truly the worst bets in craps, but leave it to Royer to convince novices to hand away thier hard earned money.  Does Royer really believe he has the answer to turning a negaive expectation game into a positive one? 
 I purchased this book here in October.  It took a month to receive it.  A few days before receiving it in the mail I had stopped at a local bookstore to see if they had a copy (I was desperate and needed patterns for this years stockings).  I wasn't that impressed, I've definitely seen better. Sure, there are a couple patterns that are nice but I don't think it's worth the $. So I returned the book.  I'm glad I had a chance to look at it before it finally  arrived.  I'm also surprised to see the promise of 2 day shipping.  If you're intending on getting this for some last minute Christmas knits, don't count on it 
 I began reading this book quite a few years ago but elected to stop after forty pages.  It is aimless, vile, and without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Be warned: this is one you'll be ashamed to put in the garage sale...if you don't decide to just set it up in flames and put it out of its misery first 
  well the band sounds like a yellow card,simple plan,panic at the disco,all american rejects etc. ALL of the bands have the same sound and music that a person from 10-17 would buy. And you proboly saw the video before hearing the song on the radio. If your older 18 and up. you need to get in to some GOOD music. Try the ramones, the offspring, sex pistols or even green day.    
 An ok reading. I would reccomend the Military and Police Sniper firs 
 Have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it. Simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme.  They say we Americans are obese in body, but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism.  Page after page of glossy ads for things we do NOT need.  And rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections.  Sure they make pretty pictures, but who wants all that 'junk' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful.  I recommend the magazine Dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning.  For someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden, Oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply. And how many homes does one American need, when so many Americans cannot afford even one 
 Come on, this is 2005. Twinkies aren't "food" anymore than Cheez Whiz is. Twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies. Consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines. Everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while - I'm just as guilty of that - but eating Twinkies is practically self-mutilation. Look at the ingredients list and do some reading. Yikes! Everyone's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too. Sorry Hostess, that definitely does not include Twinkies 
 I've read five of the nine "Temperance Brennan" mysteries that Kathy Reichs has published, but this is my least favorite. I lost interest about two-thirds through. I felt the villains were not fleshed-out, the murder mystery too complicated and unlikely, the ending too neatly contrived, and the personal/romantic side story too awkward. This one was also too long, by about 50 pages. Reading it felt like eating a stew in which there were a multitude of ingredients, yet they did not blend into a successful flavor. The other four of her novels were fine. I love the TV series as well, although "Bones" allegedly shows Dr. Brennan much earlier in her career, with the supporting cast and the job duties and locations totally different than what is found in the books. In the TV series, "Dr. Brennan" has a steady cast of supporting characters who grabbed my mind and heart very quickly. In the books, her lesser characters all seem...lesser, indeed. Better luck next time out, Dr. Reichs 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 As fans of 'Starship Troopers' know, the very name 'Starship Troopers' implies a galaxy-sweeping epic with lots of violence, gore, heroism, humor, drama and tons of big-budget special effects.  This one is limited to one location, his lots of gore but  little in the humor, drama and big-budget special effects department.  One has to wonder at the thought processes in Hollywood. 'Starship Troopers' was a big success. Sure, it was expensive, but it is also a regular staple on cable TV and it continues to sell well (#2500 or so on Amazon in DVD sells as of today - which isn't bad for a 10 year old movie).  One would think that a Starship Troopers 2 would have been in the works for a long time - perhaps a final push to the bug home system. Instead, according to the director's commentary track, the special effects director of the original Starship Troopers came up with this simple, low-budget plot that he wanted to direct.  Somehow sold it to the powers-that-be at Sony and they backed it, provided that he slash his already bare bones budget even more.   So, what do you get when you give Starship Troopers 2 a budget that is only 5% (yes - five percent!) the size of the original movie? A bad movie full of special effects tricks that you are most likely to see in 50s sci-fi cult classics. The movie's premise changes from being a war epic to being a haunted castle movie, a premise that the producers and director freely admit to on the director's track. They also admit to it being a "B movie" and that it was intentionally filmed to go straight to DVD. Some reviewers have made comments about it being a poorly-lit movie. That was also intentional - poor lighting means that the movie's special effects can be of lesser quality. Unfortunately, one of Tippett's other compensations for a low budget is to add more blood to every scene in the last half of the movie. It gets silly after a while, rather than dramatic.  The movie is derivative of several other movies and TV shows including:  -Star Trek: TNG. Remember the plot that Picard uncovered in which aliens were physically inserting themselves into the brains of high-ranking members of Star Fleet? Well, I hate to write a spoiler, but...  X-Files. Same as a above  Aliens - there's a scene that just steals from the one in which the Paul Reiser character drops an alien into Ripley's sleeping quarters.  Alien - the dark sets with a creepy monster about.  John Carpenter's 'The Thing' - the premise of being an outpost cut off from the rest of humanity while an alien takes people over one by one. The scene where the General is chased into the base steals from the one in which the dog in 'The Thing' is chased to the Antarctic research lab by the helicopter.   Brenda Strong comes to this movie as a familiar face, but not as the same character. Her character in the original Troopers was a fleet captain who died a horrible death. In this one she is an army sergeant. No one is quite sure why they felt the need to have a face from the first mivie but she does a good job and on the director's track they credit her with making this movie shoot a positive experience on a lot of levels. That makes it all the more bizarre that her name is not listed on the cover of the DVD or on the back cover credits. Too bad - her character was just about the closest thing that I found to believable in the whole movie.  I give this two stars rather than one because I found the director's/producer's track to be quite fascinating. Maybe it should only be watched with that track playing.  I give this one a D-. It fails to deliver on the promise of the original in so many ways 
 Why not just go to the library and pick up volume 1 of the Artificial Life journal. That's all this is. Did someone really have the gall to sell us a journal twice? Yes, Virginia, I guess they did 
 I haven't read any of "Nasdijj"'s writings, and I don't expect to do so, but as a REAL Amerind (Cherokee), I am disturbed and indignant at Navajos being used as a publicity hook by a white sado-masochist.  Don't take my word for it.  Read an exhaustive exposé at http://www.laweekly.com/index.php option=com_lawcontent&task=view&id=12468&Itemid=47  
 Unfortunately, I watched this movie with my kids instead of BEFORE my kids.  Had I seen it in advance, I wouldn't have shown it to them.  My kids are 3 and 5.  My 3 year old found the movie pretty scary - alligators chase Babar, Celeste's mother is put in jail, rhinos chase Babar, throw spears, fight with swords, launch flaming rocks at the elephant village, etc.  My 5-year old didn't find the movie too scary, but spent quite a while after watching the movie conisdering why the rhinos wanted to attack the elephants AND looking for someone to have a mock sword fight with.  So, I can't recommend a movie that left one child a bit scared and the other ready to go to battle 
 Make sure that you want to buy this type of book.  It was not at all what I was expecting 
 I was really looking forward to reading this book. I am a nut for anything to do with the American Revolution. I'd read Brookhiser's short, concise bio on George Washington and enjoyed it very much. I was so disappointed with this book. Just looking at the cover and reading the blurbs made me expect too much I guess.  Morris was known for 3 things: losing his leg, writing the Constitution, and scoring with the ladies. How could his life be turned into a snoozefest?  Maybe it's the writing...I just finished reading Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton bigoraphy, which is 3 times longer than this Morris bio. It was absolutely riveting. I was sorry when I finished it; I just did not want it to end. I could not finish the Morris book fast enough; I ended up skipping pages here and there to get to Morris; he seems to be missing in his own biography. Brookhiser gave me no sense as to the kind of man Gouverneur Morris really was.  Very disappointing 
 IF you already know how to cook this book is an "insult" - it's so basic it's laughable.  Plus most of the more "interesting" recipes can be found online at any of several low-carb web sites.  I also found that there were editorial mistakes - like the temperature which to bake a cheescake was eliminated.  And mistakes on the author's part in which she does not indicate the size pan to use - which DOES make a difference in the final outcome of any baked item.  The author also uses ingredients that are HARD to come by in her recipes without giving substitutes.    All in all I was quite disappointed!  But in all fairness - it would be a good "starting" cookbook for those folks who are lacking in the culinary arts. 
 I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help 
 After breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group Chicago, Traitor Cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker.  It's coincidental that the first track is titled "Big Mistake", as if Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make.  I bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money, and after I had listened to the album once, I made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly.   What else is here?  Oh, you have the "Karate Kid II" ballad "Glory of Love", a tune so nauseating it's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon, and go straight from the original "Karate Kid" to "III" and "Next" whenever I do my yearly film marathon.  I just pretend the second film never existed.  It also has the semi-smash "Next Time I Fall", where Traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist Amy Grant.   In short, if you a) thought Cetera's leaving Chicago was a great decision, or b) like your music pointless and nauseating, by all means get this album.  If you want music with real heart and soul, just go buy some Chicago.  You'll be glad you did 
 This is good hip-hop music, but that's ALL it is.  The infectious tango track from the movie, (which was even used again for the title page on DVD), is conspicuously NOT there, nor any waltz, rumba or other ballroom music tracks that were in the movie.  I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MOVIE ABOUT URBAN SCHOOL KIDS WHO LEARN BALLROOM DANCING!  Sure, the hip-hop tracks should be there too because that was an integral part of the film, but that was only about half the music in the film.  And in this case, the absence of ballroom dancing tracks, for a movie specifically about ballroom dancing is unforgivable.  There should be a disclaimer on the cover of this CD to warn away anyone looking for the great, danceable tango, waltz, etc. tracks that were in the film.  
 I was totaly disapointed with the ending in this series of books. I felt let down, and like I had waisted my time and money on the entire series 
 I found this book boring.  Her message was good, but her delivery did nothing for me 
 I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
 No this is not Quantum Physics, this is just another book picking little parts of Quantum Physics, removing all the math, removing a lot of the logic, and adding poetic license.  Look, if you're interested in Quantum Physics, and REAL science, there are plenty of other books that are much better at explaining real Quantum Physics on a level most people understand.  Brian Greene has a couple very good books that do just that, No formuli either.  You may have to look up an occasional word, but if your not willing to do that, I don't understand how you're going to learn anything ever anyways.  This book is much more towards philosophy than physics.  I can agree with the first paragraph, and from there on is philosophy.  And physicists don't have 'faith' particles exist, they know they do from scientific observation.  Billions aren't invested in Particle Accelerators so scientists can get faith, that would be clearly pointless.  I'm working to my Doctorate in Physics, and when they find out I'm primarily interested in Quantum Physics I am too commonly asked what I think about beliefs that are in books like this.  If you read this, you're wasting your time. The only thing it is good for, is for the author who's making money off of whoever is foolish enough to buy it, so please, find a book with real science.  A key way you can tell is real books will often try to explain concepts with examples, the other kind of books explain things with imagery and romanticism.  
 When i first bought these things they were awesome and really cute.  i loved the volume control they isolated noise pretty well just not wind but for the price i guess one can't expect much. all of a sudden the right ear just stopped working.  i only had them for about a month and i wish i kept the receipt or the box maybe i could've had some sort of reimbursement but I'll never know hopefully everyone else has better luck with thos 
 Noel Ignatiev wants to deconsturct (read: destroy) the social phenomenon of "whiteness".  What does it mean to destroy a people's culture and traditions in toto?  It means to destroy them.  If Hitler had gone about forcing all Jews to intermarry to the point that there were no Jews left, the result would have been the same as killing them as individuals.  The people would be destroyed.  What Ignatiev is supporting is nothing short of genocide, and though he may say he doesn't mean he want inidividuals killed (although I doubt his sincerity on this) he certainly does want a whole race or group of people destroyed.   What a sick puppy 
 I had to put this book down several times before being able to slog through it.  Expositional and boring dialogue, ho-hum plot, and unlikeable characters. When Bourne's wife has the stupidity to follow him to Paris to "save" him only to admonish him for being a stone cold killer in front of his colleagues, it becomes laughable.  Couple that with the fact Bourne has to do everything for the bimbo, including grabbing her purse from the gunshot scene at the hotel and you almost wish she'd been offed. How is this tripe possible from the man who wrote The Aquitane Progression?  It truly seems like another writer.  This book is completely unworthy of it's predecessor, The Bourne Identity 
 The 2006 remake of Zapf's Baby Chou Chou is no Baby Annabell. The hard plastic battery casing on the dolls back is not padded and all four sharp sides stick out, taking up most of the backside of the doll.  This makes it very uncomfortable for a child to hold and you can forget the idea of them falling asleep with it. There is a large gap between what little padding there is in the body and leg; making the sewn leg attachment visible through the clothing.  The dolls voice is not clear. What was Zapf thinking when they did away with Baby Annabell? I'm sure Corolle stock will go up this Christmas, their Lila is a great doll 
 Nuevamente, Coelho nos demuestra sin tapujos lo que es su principal interes. Ganar dinero con literatura barata y facilista destinada para dar a oir lo que se quiere oir sin compromiso, con una llanura mental rampante. Lastima de los arboles cortados para hacer el papel en el que se imprimio esta basura 
 I want my money back. I feel like a burned a hole in my wallet. The only songs I like on this CD is Hero, Shelter, My Nutmeg Phantasy, Farewell, and Main Titles but the others suck and most of them aren't even Spiderman. Shelter is a great song it's from Fast and the Furious and it's also in the movie in the part where Peter wants the money after he wrestles Bones but the reason why I like the song is because it's from The Fast and the Furious and that's a great movie. The CD cover was great to look at it even had images from the movie including a cool 3D Spiderman cover on front but from what I got when I listened to it some of the songs weren't even in the movie it's just songs that some dude really wanted money from Sony and he just put the Soundtrack in stock but main reason why I got it is because I really wanted to listen to the themes from the trailers like Hell Above Water, Pompeii, and Leave You Far Behind but they weren't on there including the World Trade Center theme it wasn't on there too but still I'm warning you Spiderman fans do not buy the soundtrack but if you really loved the score go buy it I own it and listen to it all the time it's great but please do not waste your money on this soundtrack stick with Danny Elfman's amazing score. Spiderman 2 soundtrack is way better than this piece of crap CD. 
   This book was one of the biggest wastes of my time as far as 'self help' books are concerned. I would never recommend it to anyone, especially someone with low self esteem.  "So when we've had it with our friend, colleague, or sibling, it's because he or she is giving voice to parts of us that we have suppressed of rejected, parts of us that don't fit the persona we've created to present to the rest of the world."  Pure rubbish 
 The "sticky" pads that are supposed to hold the organizer don't even stick, so every morning I would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table...and this was with absolutely NO items in it.  The organizer doesn't come with any information, so I had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not.  This is a great idea, but it is very poorly constructed.  
 The First Four years was released many years after These Happy Golden Years brought a sweet, tidy ending to the series. I did not like this book and it just does not feel like it belongs with the other books. It is about hardship and bitter times and disturbs the harmony of the other titles. I'd recommend serious thought be given before this book is begun 
 the examples are worthless.  who knows if they are even real.  all he does in this book is shamelessly market his other books and newsletters 
 As most anyone will tell you, these speakers do have excellent sound and if you're just going to set them up on your desktop, then I'd give them 5 stars.  However, the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can't ceiling-mount them.  Logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no "universal speaker mounts" will work with them.  If you want to see how they mount, go to Logitech's website, go to product support and enter wall mounting.  Some might argue that they're computer speakers, not home entertainment center speakers, but for $300, I expect a little bit better design 
 ZERO (0) stars is what i would like to give this coaster of a disc.  I am a fan of OLP's spiritual machines, clumsy, naveed, and happiness is not a fish. WHAT IN THE HELL HAPPENED TO THIS BAND? Their past 2 release have been such a far departure from what led to their success, i am left scratching my head. What a joke. Do not buy this junk 
 Racist Black Garbage 
 This book was awful. THe author is a bad writer in general. Also, as you can tell from her scary emaciated grin on the back of the book, she is NOT recovered. This means that she cannot distance herself from her disorders and therefore can't really write about them well. There is a tinge of smugness in her account, like, "Look how thin I am, I just CAN'T eat." It's boring and it's about a really lame person...she is incapable of living her life at all. She still lived with her parents for the majority of her life 
 Really only for someone who knows nothing about computers. Very basic information 
 Bought a pair of these chairs to use at the beach. My chair collapsed within an hour on the first day at the beach while I was sitting in it reading. The mechanism for the recline positions is made of soft and cheap plastic and will not hold for long. I'm 200 lbs. My wife's chair showed signs of the same bent plastics and she's only 110 lbs. I returned them and will buy new ones with metal mechanisms 
 After reading the reviews of this book, I for one am just so relieved that all of these tortured tortured geniuses who loved the book finally have a voice.  From what I can tell, most of them were "forced" to read this book by their crafty and maniacal friends and loved ones.  It must be wonderful for them to finally have a champion that can refute all of this backward, nonsensical, mean spirited hokum that we call Christianity.  Nevermind the fact that the only expert that Doherty brings to bare is himself.  Nevermind the fact that Strobel had more than a dozen.  Nevermind the fact that Christianity is the force that has been changing the world for the last 2000 years.    Seriously though, what you should remember is that when Strobel gathered his evidence, he was seeking to disprove Christianity 
 Buyer beware. After paying for this book, the DVD-rom will prompt you to pay another US$30 for 80 additional exercises. That's a hidden expense which is not mentioned in the product description. This is wrong. I suppose for a book which is not intended for the beginner, the author assumes that you have the extra cash to spend on the additional exercises 
 My copy of the book did not have chapters 3 and 4.  I had a chapters 1 and 2 repeated.  Check your copy of the book 
 I ordered an online e editon 2 volumes and CD I didnt not get the online pin number. I wrote to amazon and Still I havent heard from them It is a total cheatin 
 I rarely write reviews, but quoting Ebert(who inexplicably liked this!): I HATED THIS MOVIE.   1. Is editor the correct term to apply to Joe Klotz?  I give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4.  If you want to see a good slow paced movie watch L'Aaventura.  For a much better recent indie film about family life buy the Squid and the Wale.   2. If the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well. Amy Adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb, but sweet southerner (see Forrest Gump, Waterboy).  I guess her performance reaffirmed what Hollywood thinks of the south.  Notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from California or NY.  Does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs?   3. I assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism.  I feel bad for the masochists, but not the pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit.   4. RENT THIS FIRST and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not $19.9 
 While I  liked following the new perspectives of an old favorite, it seemed like Tennant was trying too hard to write as a classic. I was often confused by what she was writing. The wording/descriptions were awkward, difficult to follow, and not completely confident (or competent) 
 I must say that I do agree with the words of David Nightengale (Saint Paul, MN) that "If you want to know about accident prevention go to the System Safety Society".  The book talks a lot on tight coupling, or dependence, of different parts of systems during different states (DEPOSE, design, equipment, procedures, operators, supplies and materials, and environment), but it all remains very qualitative. Safety and reliability engineers prefer quantitative approaches, which are abundantly available in the area of systems reliability.   The author does have an attractive style of writing. Especially the presentation on dam failures (the Grand Teton, the Malpasset and Vaiont dam failures) was interesting to read. 
 This book is disappointing for Red Sox fans, and I would assume of little interest to non Red Sox fans who are tired of having the Sox shoved down their throats since October '04.  Considering Mnookin had his own desk at Fenway and all of this supposed insider access to the team, there is little to no new information here for those who have followed the Red Sox closely.  If you read the Globe and/or the Herald during this time period and followed the team, there really isn't anything new here.  Mnookin also spends several chapters telling the history of the Red Sox.  If you're a Sox fan, you've heard all of this a hundred times before.  In many ways this book reads as advertising for the Red Sox (look at the book's title).  The only person Mnookin really criticizes harshly is Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy, who he paints as a modern day Max Mercy.  While this may well be the case, it's hardly new information, many Boston fans dislike/distrust Shaughnessy already.  It's pretty easy to go after a guy most people don't like anyway.  It's always interesting to read about the Sox, but you might want to rent this from the local library rather than buy it.  You've read this all before 
 I thought I'd find more logical techniques for sleep from Dr Brazelton since I enjoy all his other books, but this book just follows the old-school cry it out method. I did find many non-crying solutions in a newer book called the No Cry Sleep Solution. 
 The go-cart is much smaller that it appeared to be. My 2 year old barely fits. These is no reverse and it is a sit in toy. So the child has to get completely out to turn around, or you have to follow them around. The steering column is not straight so the steering wheel has to be sideways to drive straight. All together it is not a very impressive to. My daughter enjoys it very much but I should not have got rid of her Lil' Quad. 
 In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?"  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever.  
 The first two books in the series were very enjoyable however this book is difficult to get through. The book does not flow like the others. The story of the orphan girl's life is told differently in two of the books. The characters have become dry and the book is a chore to read. I will try the next in the series hoping this was just a one off thing.     
 Jasper Becker belongs in the camp that wants to attack North Korea and force regime change. As such, this book tries to justify a war by hyping up all the bad things happening in North Korea. He is also trying to sell his book by sensationalizing North Korea like a cheap tabloid. He thinks that America can save the North Koreans by destroying their country. This book is almost a neocon propaganda - very biased, and one-sided.  
 Normally I like this author's stuff, but this was not one of her better efforts. Maybe next time 
 This book appears to have been originally published just before the NASDAQ crash in March of 2000. The copy that I purchased from Amazon.com appears to be a private re-publication of really first class quality by Ned Davis Reseach after the event. It was probably used as a presentation to clients and prospective clients to show the quality of his forecasting. Davis hit it right on the money. There is no doubt about that, and this book reflects his reasoning process before the event, unlike so many books written in hindsight.    
 I have always had first alert smoke alarms and they always worked great and lasted for what seems like forever, in fact, i have never had a smoke alarm die, until now.  When I moved into my aparment 10 years ago, my first alert smoke alarm was there already and to this day, it still works.  I only changed the alarm because of new laws. A year after I started using this one, it died on me.  I was very disappointed in the longevity of the product 
 Having watched great movies in the Bible series such as Joseph, David, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and Samson and Delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures, I was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film. What a let down by this anachronism. How low can one go! This is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of God.  If you do not believe in God, have never read the Bible, particularly Genesis but have heard of Noah from hearsay, perhaps this movie might be of some entertaining value, a mediocre one at that.  If you are looking for a movie with an accurate account of Noah's ArK, don't aggravate yourself. Avoid this movie like a plague. 
 This is the worst sounding Donny Osmond collection I've heard.  You are better off getting either of the other compilations put out on the Curb label.  This cd sounds overly bright and shrill 
 Catherine Crier and indeed every defense attorney and state district attorney in the country had no doubts that Peterson did it.  Given both the evidence and his odd behavoir trying to flee the country and being caught in the process.  But this book is little more then a retold story of something that was already fully documented by those who took the case to court and won.  Thanks, but no Thanks Ms. Crier 
 this movie was kinda boring. Not enough of Cross' standup. Also when there was footage of his stand up, it wasnt that funny 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 I'm a huge BC fan and I thought his first book was great, I actually laughed out loud multiple times while reading it (which looks kind of weird on an airplane). This one misses the mark completely. As a made up account of making a movie, it fails completely. The story and events are rediculously not plausible or funny. He should stick to non-fiction 
 I was expecting a "kit" based on the title.  It turned out to be a 210 page paper-back book. The main reason I bought the "kit" was to get sample contracts, but none were included.  He does a decent job  of describing the basic process, and good ideas on marketing. Overall, I'd  look for a better source if you're planning to FSBO your home 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 The book's title is very misleading. The title implies that it covers the entire workflow process, but it does not. The book provides some very interesting case studies, from the perspective of a working cinematographer, and if you're just interested in shooting digital, the content will be quite informative. If you are looking for some more specific information on the post production process, such as editing digital content, and distribution, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. 
 Great it was delivered in a timely manner and in good condition. thank 
 never before has a movie had such an apt title as this mess. the plot is as thin as the main person in the movie gets. just really a waste of time and money for me,i thought! skip this mess!! 
 This book is tailored for older children and even then it's not well written for them. The details are too numerous to keep the young child's attention. There are not enough picture illustrations and the situations described herein are not general enough to fit society as a whole. There is too much of a focus on the "wrong" things to do in school verses the right things. Many of the suggestions and story's of how children did things the wrong way can backfire on parents and actually give children ideas of the wrong things to try. Much of the book could not be used for our home and school life situations. Few children will stay captivated by this book. My eldest child who is gifted thought it was boring and many of the issues she couldn't even relate to. My youngest was in over his head and I had to skip reading the long drawn out situations and paraphrase things to keep his attention 
 Charles Fort had intelligence, yes. But where do his theories stand now? For instance, his thoughts on the "raining frogs and fish" occurance goes like this: he denied the scientific theory that they were sucked up in a waterspout and made his own: that all lifeforms were created in a giant sargasso sea in the sky and occasionally intelligent aliens dropped them to Earth. He generalizes the entire scientific community in simple strokes, physicists, your doctor, astronomers, chemists, yes, he claims to debunk them all. Is evolution true to Fort? Nope, all life is created in the sargasso sea in the sky: Genesistrine, and is teleported or dropped by aliens to Earth. Crackpot lit 101: Charles Fort 
 The only reason Susan McCrook wouldn't talk was she was afraid she'd end up taking an ADN (Arkansas dirt nap). Case closed 
 As a fan of historical mysteries, I was looking forward to starting this popular series.  I was deeply disappointed.  First of all, the character of Amelia Peabody is not appealing, and through her the author reveals that she has only a very superficial understanding of Victorian values and thinking.  (Although if you don't mind an author sticking a character with modern sensibilities in period dress, maybe this is for you.)  Furthermore, the mystery was simply not that interesting.  I found myself reading only to finish the book, for I had little interest in finding out who committed the murders. The success of this series and the acclaim the author has received truly baffle me 
 I used to love this kettle.  I've had this kettle for over four years now and it has developed the same problem as some of the people who gave it one-star reviews.  The electrical contacts have degraded over the past few months and today I couldn't get it to turn on at all no matter how many times I twisted it around on its base.  I've cleaned the contacts twice in the past few months to no avail.  Maybe an improvement for all of a day each time.  Looking inside the base, I can see why the contacts die -- they don't grip the metal ring & spike at all, but rather the ring and spike just rest on loosely sprung metal.  Wish I'd thought to inspect that before buying it.  There's no excuse for such a bad design.  Were they hoping for a repeat buy?  Not going to happen 
 I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story.  The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit 
 I never got through listening to this whole album... I bought it because I was a fan of Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini - but just hearing the first few minutes of Kelly's version of Respect, I lost interest.  I don't recall ever putting the cd in the cd player after that time. So if you like Kelly and Justin, buy their albums instead 
 I am a fan of Ted Nugent's 70's output, but by the time 1990 rolled around, I had stopped listening.  The same can be said of Styx and Night Ranger, both of which I listened to only casually.  By the dawn of the 90's, this style of macho, slick hard rock with flashy intruments and laughable lyrics has become stale.  I had moved on, and was not in the slightest interested in listening to this supergroup.  A friend of mine bought it and used to play it ad nauseum in his car.  I could not understand why anyone would listen to this slop in 1990, and I'd be more surprised if people were still listening to it now.  Do yourself a favor... go boy some of Ted's earlier albums, and put this foul dog back on the shelf 
 Forbes is a great magazine.  Amazon on the other hand, well they ought to get out of the magazine business.  Order said first issue would be in February.  Amazon "forgot", to place the order until I called in April to find out what happened.  Now they claim the first issue will be June 19.  Yeah right.  Funny how they don't forget to charge the credit card you place the order.  Don't order magazines from Amazon 
 I think that Bring it on Again is a really bad movie, not to mention the boringness in it. The reason I have given it a 2 out of 5 stars is bcuz it was plain boring. I mean who would wanna watch a movie like this? Firstly actors werent hot like the the people in the first movie. There wasnt any one there that made the movie any better or any more fun to watch. The rest of it was pretty boring! Secondly, the movie was way boring coz the stars were practically anonomous! And they still are! Thirdly the movie just wasnt as fun as the first one. I mean the cheers in this movie isnt even that good. And u wouldnt repeat the cheers after the movie unlike the first movie, after an hour u would still think of the cheers and say it to urself. Maybe even copy them and use it for ur own team!And there werent any 'higher stakes, hotter grooves or any more attitude! ' It doesnt even have hotter grooves or moves and the person who created the cover must be crazy becuz there is NOT any more attitude! So over all this movie is not worth watching bcuz its really boring and its just doesnt have as much groove as the first movie. I have to say, no offence to the whole cast or anything.. but this is the worst sequel to a great movie ive ever watched 
 This book had some good ideas if it were 1970. It's very outdated. I'm sure it was a good book when it was still current, but in 2006, it's just a a waste of time and money. 
 I expected more from Kenyon, but at least I wasn't completely lost in her works.  I own all of her Dark-Hunter books and all of them.  This was a short story so I didn't expect too much but as for the other authors I didn't even read the last two stories because L.A. Banks' story was too hard to follow and turned me off completely.  Who talks like that anyway?  You can't follow her story line, the characters speak broken English or slang English so much to the point that I didn't even want to finish her story.  I usually am not a huge fan of compilation stories but this book was beyond disappointing.  I will NEVER purchase another book by L.A. Banks; her writing style is too hard to follow.  Having to read broken English slang is not my thing.  I just read another of L.A. Banks short stories in My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding she uses the same writing style and slang in this story too; it is a total turn off and only solidifies my decision not to purchase any other books by her 
 Although everyone empathized with June, we couldn't understand her loyalty. We wished she had been as loyal to Aunt Peggy. There were some readers that didn't finish because they felt the story was going nowhwere.  Then you had those that finished only to be relieved that it was over.  We hope that June has sought some type of professional counseling behind this, because this was not something that you just "get over".  Having been rejected by her mother and knowing that it wasn't just her (but her white brother and sister too) should have made the blow a little easier.  It's evident that June placed a barrier around herself to shield her feelings as an adult.  She is a successful lady despite her past and that matters most.  
 OK...this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted. It barely picks up even simple dirt and debris, and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds, not minutes.   Also, it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into Bank of America and swipe a few mil. Really, its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge. Stupid....stupid...stupid design. The same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together...its like a rubics cube.   A true waste of 40 bucks. Don't buy this! It doesn't even look very cool 
 Fine acting, especially by Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately the drunk but brilliant lawyer is a bit of a  cinematic cliche. Then we have to deal with the conspiracy by the military and the husband being the fall guy. (Don't read any further if you want to watch this movie)  So we go through this whole conspiracy investigation, the General is sufficiently blackmailed to have the charges dropped, then the guy ends up as having done it after all. So then the conspiracy was really a bogus plot device to mislead the audience. The phone taps,Ashley Judd being followed, getting beaten up, etc, etc, etc, all misdirection by the writers and director. but the cast and acting were all good 
 A waste of money for those of us who live in the real world versus the spiritual world 
 I bought this toaster oven because it had a convection oven.  I have not toasted anything yet but I did make a small roast beef which took as long to cook it as it would if I had used my regular oven and the bottom burnt also. I only used it on the lowest degree and had to guess on how long to cook it.  The instructions do not give you any help with deciding how long and what temperature to use, so you just have to guess. I emailed Oster Customer Service to ask how long to cook things or if they had a some other instructions that might be of help, they got back to me and said "use the temperature that you would normally use to cook the item and cut the cooking time in half" that was not much of a help. I will not buy anything else made by Oster because of the trouble I had with another toaster oven made by them. This one looked good and the inside was large so I thought I would give it a try, I guess that was a bad idea.  I will be returning the oven to Amazon and I have no idea what brand to buy next 
 I've had excellent luck with Tweezerman products in the past, but the quality of this blackhead remover was second-rate.  The item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw-in attachments.  Neither attachments really work.  The threading of both seems to be flawed.  And to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face; no thanks!  My e-mailed request for re-threading or replacement to Tweezerman went unanswered.  This purchase was an expensive mistake 
 While the characters of this story are engaging, there's no follow through.  You don't really get an idea of what happens to people at the end.  You are left to your own imagination for a lot of instances.  I understand that it is Christian fiction since it refers to numerous biblical quotes, but we really don't get an idea of people's faith.  The people don't really seem to have a relationship with God.  I was truly disappointed 
 Unfortunately I concur with the semtiments of the other reviewers.  I ordered the system based on the writeup in the New York Times.  At least I can save the $40 price by ordering books from Amazon.com.  First, I could not open the CD-ROM, but apparently the program is not useful.  Second, book's main virtue is as a general discussion of book cataloguing and organizing, best suited to a collector of fine books rather than someone (like me) who buys too many and needs to find them at home, rather than duplicating an academic library setting. For the basis of my collection's organization I used The Reader's Catalog.  It works great because of its index to over 40,000 books, a well thought-out plan, and the convenience of being a paperback book with complete bibiographic data on the books. Why type in an ISBN when they are easily available from Amazon or in a book like the Catalog?  
 Having devoured the Skye series, and finding them to be the absolute best of the historical romance genre, I found The Last Heiress to be a huge disappointment. The plot is comparatively simple.The reader waits for the adventure and intrigue of Small's previous novels, but it never comes. I find it hard to believe that this is even the same author.The plot is entirely predictable after chapter one. No surprises twists or turns. Save your money and skip this one 
  As soon as I realized who was in this film, I knew how it was going to go. Its Pierce Brosnan . Playing James Bond with another name. In this movie he's a rich guy {thief} with a thing for art. Of course, he kept all of his UNCANNY charm from his Bond roles.  If you wanna see Brosnan {effortlessly} make fools of EVERYONE {like he does in every movie he plays in} then this is for you. Personally I find it hard to care about a character that NEVER has it rough. 
 I nearly stopped reading just before the capstone section, where 10 hostages, walled up in a cell, one by one make declarations for posterity before being overcome by nerve gas. I found the book had just become completely implausible.  The characters are intricately drawn, but they are set in a plot that well before that scene is a charade of coincidences. Too many preposterous things happening make any character seem like a cardboard cutout.  What really got me about the gas was that nerve gas exposure, even in mild amounts, makes one restive, excitable, and confused; yet eight out of 10 characters are able to dictate their last words gently and carefully, in cohesive monologues, before succumbing.  The reason why this bothers me is that the author has written a sophisticated book that shows you how terrorists and corrupt spies express their humanity and how the terrible damage that they wreak is played out in the souls of those who were spared. A well-researched and plausible plot grounds the reader in the characters' reality. An outlandish plot renders the characters' actions incomprehensible, because the reader has lost her identification with what the characters would do in that situation. I wonder what would happen if I had lost my parents in a fatal hijacking, as had two of "Due Preparations"' characters; sadly, this implausible novel does not help me answer that question 
 I thought this book would be chapter legnth stories by people who visited paris. Instead, it is more like a listing of places to stay, places to eat. There were some essays, most a page or two, but they were not helpful. One example of an essay was a professor from New York who wrote how the French are rude. Another 2 page essay was on "cheap places to eat", but the cheapest resturant was over $75.     I want to enjoy my trip, not start out finding things not to like. 
 A densely packed book with many bits of interesting information but terribly organized and loaded with names, places, institutions not properly identified that are complete blanks to a non-English historian.  A great disappointment 
 Though I agree with many of Hanson's points he blows his credibility by the following statement on page 31: "And Mexico is Catholic, America mostly Protestant or secular. The former believes fate is set at birth, the latter that man earns his condition mostly here on earth." If that isn't the most inane statement from a teacher of classics I don't know what is. If he really believes that the classical curriculum at Fresno State needs a second look. Catholicism teaches nothing of the sort and most educated Catholics know that.    
 I used this book for a networks class in college.  It does cover all the material that we went over in class.  Although this book does contain a lot of useful information, it is also stuffed full of some complete nonsense.  There's a lot of stupid stupid examples when they try to describe something technical with real world situtations.  Sometimes the examples don't even relate well but are just in there because the authors felt they had to force an example into the book.  Because we had to read the book for class I spent a bunch of hours reading through 500 pages of text with only 200 pages of real information.  The main problem with this book is that it's really a 200 page book expanded out to 700-800 pages and I really can't appreciate that cause I have to read so much more 
 I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.    After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?   There are other far better literary works.   
 Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden.  As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world.  And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming "YOU are killing us!" - us?  And where does this emotion come from.  No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike?  Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained.  Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream?  Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?   
 I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort 
 I had high expectations when my homeschooling mommy friend shared with me her copy of "Five in a Row".  I had read the reviews of this curriculum and was excited to at long last be looking at it myself.  My excitement was short lived to say at best.  The author Jane Lambert basically has copied the ideas of Marjorie Nelsen and Jan Nelsen-Parish, authors of "Peak with Books" but with a right wing fundamentalist twist.  As the Bible says "There is nothing new under the sun".  Don't waste your time purchasing this overpriced, overrated curriculum, purchase "Peak with Books" instead as I did 
 I really enjoy the Ministry of Sound series, one of my favorites being the MoS High NRG Anthems cd, this cd although left me very dissapointed.  It has an incredible lack of energy, there is no trancy sound, no euro sound, no nothing sound. This is generally the problem with American music anyways.  If you like mellow music, while this is still danceable it just isnt like gushing with energy. It is a weaker dance cd. Anywho, just be careful if you like more of the high energy pumping trancy stuff, this cd isn't for you 
 There were so many things wrong with Tim Burton's take on Planet of the Apes.  Weak screenplay, bad casting, very little substance to it.  The same was with the score.  Danny Elfman tried to put the brass and the woodstring themes into something that tried to echo Jerry Goldsmith's brillent score for the 1968 film, regretfully the finished music sounds so uneven with themes and melodies that do not convey the sense of wonder and fear that the Goldsmith score has.  In the end, you sort of wish that both the remake and the music score had never been done at all 
 Despite the beautiful poetic descriptions of nature which are peppered throughout his books, James Lee Burke falls short as a mystery writer. An author shouldn't concentrate more on describing the environment than developing the plot, which is exactly what he does. And after you've read a number of his novels about the jaded ex-cop Dave Robicheaux, you start to realize that they all follow a very strict, formulaic pattern, so formulaic that I think I can summarize the generic plot of every one of Burke's novels. They all go pretty much as follows:  First, Dave Robicheaux unwittingly becomes involved in some sordid affairs, so he decides to start poking his nose around. He is threatened by criminals to stay out of their affairs, but instead of complying he beats them up and continues investigating. Despite the warnings, he is utterly shocked when the villains retaliate by harming someone close to him. The case having become more personal, Robicheaux begins running from place to place, making obtuse accusations and threats to various people until he earns the animosity of almost every character in the book. He eventually stumbles upon the solution to the mystery, and he never manages to punish those responsible because his hands are tied legally. Ultimately, it turns out that things would have worked out better for everyone had he simply not stuck his nose where it didn't belong, and there is nothing quite as disappointing as finishing a book and finding out that nothing worthwhile was accomplished by the protagonist.  Aside from this, Robicheaux becomes tiresome quickly. Though he is a decent enough guy, it is very difficult to have sympathy for a man who brings all his troubles on himself with his stupidity and unwillingness to stop poking his nose into other people's affairs.  If you feel that you absolutely have to read one of these books, my advice is to pick one at random, read it, and then don't read any of the others. Believe me, they are all the same. 
 I was really looking forward to reading this book. I am a nut for anything to do with the American Revolution. I'd read Brookhiser's short, concise bio on George Washington and enjoyed it very much. I was so disappointed with this book. Just looking at the cover and reading the blurbs made me expect too much I guess.  Morris was known for 3 things: losing his leg, writing the Constitution, and scoring with the ladies. How could his life be turned into a snoozefest?  Maybe it's the writing...I just finished reading Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton bigoraphy, which is 3 times longer than this Morris bio. It was absolutely riveting. I was sorry when I finished it; I just did not want it to end. I could not finish the Morris book fast enough; I ended up skipping pages here and there to get to Morris; he seems to be missing in his own biography. Brookhiser gave me no sense as to the kind of man Gouverneur Morris really was.  Very disappointing 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..  Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile.   However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version.. 
 Back in 1986 this probably passed for good entertainment.  We were nearing the end of a decade of glorious cheese TV (A-Team anyone?).  It was just different back then.  I remember seeing this for the first time in 1987 and actually being scared at some of the scenes, but now in 2007 I'm sitting here watching it and I'm extremely disappointed.  If you want to hear ACDC just buy the albums.  Skip this tripe 
 Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film 
 I have read every novel in the Sharon McCone series and have them all in my collection.  When I found this book at Barnes and Noble and read the description I was giddy with anticipation.  I wanted to read about the relationship between Sharon and Hy as man and wife.  I was very disappointed.  The plot line is basic and good.  A daughter wants to find her mother who disappeared over twenty years ago.  Closure is all she wants although her sister would just as soon let it be.  Thus begins the chase all around the northern California coast, ending in Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Whew!  So little time was spent in San Francisco that the office people who I have come to know and adore, were virtually non-existent.  Most of the conversation is stilted and the majority is done over the telephone.  The cell phone being turned off is a recurring distraction.  Is this supposed to have an allegorical meaning?  I don't know.  Sharon's adopted mother and biological mother rate a paragraph or two in the novel.  Hy appears once or twice and I highly doubt that a newly married man would allow his wife to be so distant from him.  Irregardless of their "evolved" relationship, I think it was cold on Sharon's part to proceed on her own when she has such available talent at the home office, just waiting for such an assignment.    My main complaint about this novel is there are two many one-dimensional characters.  I got so confused as to who was who and how they were relevant to the story.  I never got to "know" them and motivations were sometimes so closeted I was in the dark.  There was a very good potential plot in the Mark Aldin/Ricky relationship and yet it was briefly dealt with in sentences.  His death was related by phone call.  (again, the phone)    Hence the title of my review, the point vanished.  I was bored reading the book and just was not interested nor did I particularly care what happened to Laurel Greenwood.  I don't think she was intelligent enough to do what she did and I do not think she was an artist.  I will read the next book in the series and if it presents the same types of problems for me, I will probably give up reading them as I gave up on VI Warshawski years ago.  When you don't like the main character, no point in reading the novel 
 I really like everything I've read by Brust.  Up until now that is.  Where did the dark humor go?  Is the Gypsy supposed to be the hero or "Step" or ... doesn't matter, I found them all unimpressive characters.  I like to read authors I know and like, and when they go nuts writing something completely uncharacteristic it's like picking up a random book in hopes It'll amuse me when I wanted a sure thing.  I consider my time wasted in the reading of this novel 
 I'm using this book for an undergraduate thermo class.  It is one of the worst textbooks I have used.  It may be large and comprehensive, but the organization is horrible.  The book is extremely unclear, and when you start to do the problems at the end of the chapter, you really see how little got through to you.  The problems are often vague and hard to understand, which adds to the problem.  You can read it over and over and still get neither the math of thermodynamics, nor the physics behind it 
 Maps are good, that's all. After 1 year in south america with both Footprint SA and South america on a shoestring, I can say the first one in much better (exept the maps). Not updated, the informations are not really useful...If you want to travel and to be just with gringos, buy this guide. 
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 Are you KIDDING?   That was my thought after completing this novel. Horribly cliched with second-grader knowledge of horses, a plot too silly to comprehend, a child that simply gets dragged to one ranch after another and apparently (other than music and horses) receives no education, and a couple of horses who know how to get to (for the love of Pete!) an engine in the desert. Throw in sex, guns, an untouchable evil person and a woman who is the only person in the WORLD who can tame the wild Pair. I guess you call it a book. YIKES.  Masochistic streak. Yup, that's why I finished it 
 We just put the stupid thing together and put the batteries in and nothing worked.  The light would go on and off, but there were no sounds at all.  We made sure we had everything plugged in correctly, but it still wouldn't work.  After all the time of putting it together what a disappointment.  I will be calling Fisher Price tomorrow and seeing if they have any suggests and/or taking it back to Toyrus.  
 An interesting concept semi-doomed by a few built-in flaws and not a few glaring typos.  Yes, you can hardly write a book about disastrously expensive films without including movies like Cleopatra, whose financial follies have already been covered ad nauseum for decades. But where are the chapters on such spectacular misfires as Myra Breckinridge, Hello Dolly, The Little Prince, Jonathon Livingston Seagull, Howard the Duck, Heaven's Gate and Bonfires of the Vanities?   Case in point: As interesting as its offscreen travails may have been, The Wild Party (a scarely-remembered Raquel Welch "art" picture budgeted at under $1 million) was simply an unsuccessful film, not even in the same ballpark as the monumental bombs that are supposedly the book's focus. (And can this picture really have been shooting, as the author claims, from May 1974 to July 1975?)  Typos aside, this book's biggest problem is that most of the material is old news to readers most likely to want to read it.    
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 I can't believe I just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten (TEN!!) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit. By the third version, my brain turned to jelly. By the fifth, I needed a drink. By the final re-mixed version, my hangover already started to set in. This e.p. is for DJ's and masochists only. 			- Tom Rya 
 I decided to read a book on the five-hour flight from MCO to LAX, and then on the return flight of something less than five hours.  (Flying downwind eastbound, of course.)  I purchased "The Aquataine Progression" by Robert Ludlum, in paperback form.  (I must admit that I still can't get used to spending $7.95 for a paperback book!  But, the horrors of inflation obviously continue to haunt us into the 21st century, and beyond.  This promised to be worth the price inasmuch as it was touted as a "New York Times Bestseller.")  I got to Page 17 of the 658-page book before I gagged.  I managed to read only a few more pages before I set it aside disgustedly.  I quote from the book to explain why:  "Lieutenant Senior Grade Gordon Ramsey had been hit by a fluke rocket that had winged out of its trajectory over the coastline and in on Ramsey's fuselage; the explosion had filled the jet streams" - - (etc).  This almost stopped me in my tracks.  The reason for my hesitancy being the fact that there is no such grade or rank in the US Navy as "Lieutenant Senior Grade."  My inclination is to think that a noted author like Robert Ludlum (or the editor at Bantam Books) should know that while there is, indeed, a rank of "Lieutenant Junior Grade" in the US Navy, there (conversely) is NO such rank as, "Lieutenant Senior Grade."  (The ranks of "Ensign," "Lieutenant Junior Grade" and "Lieutenant" equate to "Second Lieutenant," "First Lieutenant" and "Captain" in all other branches of service except the US Coast Guard which echoes the rank structure of the Navy.  Most confusing, of course, is that the rank of "Captain" in the Navy is equivalent to "Colonel" in the other services. )  I swallowed my disapproval, and continued to read.  But then, the author goes on to tell us that the skipper of the aircraft carrier, a Captain, calls in our protagonist, a Lieutenant Junior Grade, to inform him that he is being promoted to squadron commander after "Lieutenant Senior Grade" Ramsey met his fate with the rocket as previously mentioned.  Here again, I blanched.  A skipper of an aircraft carrier would hardly deal directly with a Lieutenant "Jay Gee" (JG, for "Junior Grade") to inform him of such a thing.  There are, of course, officers of intervening rank and intervening commands and responsibilities below that of the skipper of the ship. You would have other Commanders, Lieutenant Commanders, and Lieutenants who would be in the chain of command between the skipper and the protagonist.  If there's one thing that's paramount in the military, its delegation of authority!  It would certainly be somebody else who would inform the JG of his "promotion."  So, I had to swallow hard, again, and go along with the absurd notion that a Lt. JG would report directly to a Captain, let alone the skipper of the boat.  Then, while these two are conferring, a four-star general shows up unannounced via a tender to chew-out the Navy Captain.  Aw, come on.  Between the four-star and the Captain are three-star generals, two-star generals and one-star generals.  The chain of command would insert these people into the mix well before a four-star would come and deal directly with a four-striper, let alone "chew him out."  After all, one is ARMY, and the other is NAVY.  The ticked-off general would vent his anger through not only his own chain of command, but decidedly through the chain of command of the US Navy.  I swallowed hard, again, but kept reading.  Now, what happens is that the general proceeds to chew-out the captain while the JG is still present in the quarters.  BIG SWALLOW this time.  NEVER in military protocol or in the constraints of military courtesy would a senior officer berate a junior officer in front of somebody who was junior to THAT officer!  It just does NOT happen - - except in B-grade movies that aren't worth the price of admission.  Not only that, but we are now supposed to believe that the JG interrupts the general, and tells him that he's off base for berating the captain.  I almost upchucked!  The captain dismisses the JG, but he refuses to leave (yeah, sure!) and continues to give the general a piece of his mind.  (Yeah sure, again.)  After all, he's a hot-rock fighter pilot, and he's not gonna let some four-star berate the skipper that just promoted him to squadron commander, right?  The general absorbs the static from the JG, but "orders" the Captain to launch a strike despite the unfavorable and deteriorating weather over the target.  He calls the captain "chicken" if he doesn't order the strike, and calls the JG "chicken" if he doesn't fly it.  So, the JG and everybody else fly the mission rather than being labeled as "chicken" despite the previous critical decision regarding unfavorable weather (which, of course, is a ridiculous contention) and the JG gets shot down.  Okay, this is a far as I got in the book.  It's just entirely too hollow and too outlandish in its premise to entice me to read any further.  This sophomoric rhetoric brings this book down to comic-book level.  I can't believe the blurb that says this bookspent time on the best seller list of the New York Times!  But then, I guess that inasmuch as so few of the American public will spend any time in military service these days, this kind of bull-loney can pass for "real world" scenarios and the author can weave such bull-loney into a "believable" plot.  It's a shame.  And, so is this book!  Carl B. Jordan   
 De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make "extralegal" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on.  It's a very important point but de Soto oversells, arguing with exaggerated (and oft-repeated) ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor.   He occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work. For example, he has helped businesses in Peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal, and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes: a useful bit of empirical information, but those gems appear all too occasionally.  Before reading this entire book, I recommend going to the website of de Soto's foundation (the Institute for Liberty and Democracy at www.ild.org.pe) and reading the main point there (in one tenth the words) 
 The Answers to the questions are wrong!!  For Examples - they state the largest lake in the WORLD is Lk. Superior.. Nope, Caspian Sea.  (Please look up the word lake!! 
 Used this Digital Compass for about 20 days and am returning it. It  does not seem to be capable of giving reliable directions. The same position - try the reading twice and the directions are off wildly. Tried in open fields, inside my home and the same. Tried calibrating a dozen times and setting the Declination correctly, but no change 
 I was VERY disapointed in this book. My 3 year old just started holding her poops in, and this was the only book I could find to try to help her. It covers things like trauma to the child, as where I just need to get the basics across to her. This is more for a 2nd grader, not a little one 
 Harry Connick, Jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie, but nonetheless, this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture. If you are purchasing this CD because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends, as I do, then I do not recommend this CD; instead I would buy the originals 
 I had to order this twice from Amazon because the first time I ordered it used and it did not come with the book included which I thought was a rip off because the seller said you did not need it.  I ordered it again new and really realized the used seller was wrong as the book with CD's is an absolute necessity.  I rated it one star as I am reviewing the 1st purchase.  I was not happy 
 I have lived in El Salvador now for over eight years.  To visit El Salvador for three days and continue to make a profit on those three days -past- seems completely immoral to me, especially since the book remains in print and continues to influence the world's opinion of El Salvador.  I find this completely unfair.  Would it be possible for Joan or Oliver or anyone else that enjoyed an income from the events of 20+ years ago to come back and revise their assesment?  It would probably cost them all of two or three thousand dollars for the trip, but of course, it would stop the thousand if not million dollars in sales of these recollections which were wish fullfilling fantasies to begin with.  All of El Salvador suffered during this time, why perpetuate the suffering?  And what about any three days in any given city in North America?  Could'nt the "glass is half empty" scenario be drawn to horrify any sensible person from every wanting to visit there, simply by selectively clipping the daily paper?  I think so. 
 Years ago, these really were ground steak burgers with a very special flavor.  The most recent shipment I had was tastless with an unusually chewy texture.  Not recommended 
 I was very excited to find this book, as I have read other works by Roger Abrahams and absolutely loved them. Unfortunately, however, upon reading an excerpt of the book I discovered that one of the stories contained a tale in which a man, in his attemps to assert his superiority over a woman, repeatedly beats her. While I am not sure of what age bracket this book is meant for, the fact that that story was included, regardless of it folkoric accuracy, is very shocking. I'm very dissapointed 
 you cannot indirectly blame other cultures for the evils of the world, ignorance is a far greater foe. I pity the Author for an otherwise well informed book, she has let herself down in her lack of education of other cultures and ignorance. when writing a book research is important, and so is education, that is the ability to understand what you have researched. In a world often rife in racism and persecution, another coal in the fire. Clearly the Author does not have sufficient knowledge of Wicca or eastern religions, which in 2007 is abismal. may your soul have peace Dion 
 Do NOT buy this book. I am sure the author understands a lot about statistics but he definitely does not know how to organize its ideas. The book makes the subject appear much more complex than it really is. If you need to learn statistics are not a Statistics PhD student then what I really recommend you to do is to get another book. For MBA students: This book is way more complex than you will need to know for your studies 
 While the 18 recipes in this cookbook (yes, you read correctly, 18) do represent traditional Greek cooking well, most of the recipes would be difficult for a young cook to make without adult supervision and assistance.  Traditional favorites such as baklava, spanikopita and stuffed grape leaves are included among the recipes.  The beginning of the book has cultural information about Greece and safe cooking tips.  This book would be helpful for a school project about Greece, but it is disappointingly short 
 I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was.  All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Busy with a project of my own I have finally found time to catch up on the WOT series. Unfortunately RJ has continued to add subplots with out closing out some of the existing ones. In short, WOT has become infested with too many major and minor characters running around doing their own thing.  One of the more aggrevating additions RJ has made is the insertion budding technology into WOT in the form of steam engines, gunpowder, etc. It basically detracts from the main storyline and everytime I run across it I skip ahead. Winter's Heart does not move the story ahead much. 
 Read Andrea Makris' law suit at www.thesmokinggun.com all the dirty details are there, and should be required reading for anyone who reads O'Reilly or takes him seriously. He SETTLED the case after smearing her and threatening her, he's a little wimp and a coward and a "loofa" loving creep. Keep him away from your children! I Know the guy. from Washington  Jeff Gannon 
 Very brief, short on content, and does not go beyond basic common workout and health knowledge. This book could only benefit those with no knowledge of PJ's and CCT's due to it's short overview of the programs which could be found by searching the Net anyhow. The workouts that are included are very basic and could be created by oneself with any knowledge at all of running and calisthenics. I am about to go into the PJ Indoc program, from my view the book would be a lot better if it went into the day-to-day lives of the PJ's and CCT's and offered more information and tips on prepping for the constant rigors they go through 
 These authors deserve far more than two stars, but the misleading title doesn't.  Buy this book only if you're looking for collections of great poetry/essays; you'll find very few novels/novel segments in here.  
 The show might be very entertaining but the CD is quite boring with only one song worth replaying 
 This book does not include plates of birds that are included in Peterson Field Guides from Western North America, Eastern North America or Texas. So, unless you have their guide books memorized for these locations, the Mexico guide book is basically useless. Alternatively, you could buy all four books  (Eastern NA, Western NA, Texas, and Mexico) and carry them all with you. Or you could just purchase a different, stand-alone guide book with plates of the most or all of the birds in the region. 
 This book "guarantees" that you will see changes in your body - and in as little as two weeks.  Well, it sounds too good to be true and it is.  I followed this plan for months and it did nothing.  So where do I get my money back?    There are some good tips for healthier eating in this book, so if you get most of your meals from a fast-food place this might help you out, but it definitely doesn't produce the results it promises 
 Please consider buying a used copy for half the price/ I wish I would have. Bought it based on the cover and the editorial review. Big Mistake! The cover was far cooler than the movie and the editorial was not exactly accurate and kinda misleading! It was indeed about a group of kids who have (you guessed it) car trouble! That is where the similarity ends. The bats were not awakened by the kids. They were there from the beginning scene and who knows how they got there. I sure don't. If you are looking for a good bat movie there are better ones out there for sure. I thought this one was lacking in substance. And no, i do not mean lots of blood and gore. I'll take that in a movie, sure, but I am not so shallow as to think that is all there is to a good scare. This movie just never gets off the ground and then it's over! No suspense or chills and thrills. Not much really going on with the BATS! And the freaky Egor narrator at the beginning of the movie? What is all that for anyway?  He interrupts the movie several times which is just down right distracting and aggravating. 
 could not wait to get my hands on this new mcallister book, the previous efforts being so entertaining & w/such superb character development. this one was all over the map as i guess even the best writers experience a "hiccup" now & again! certainly NOT worth the price of admission 
 As an economics student, this book makes NO sense whatsoever. His ideas are SO far fetched it almost looks as though it is a sci-fi book. Whoever gave it 5 stars must not know how capitalism really works, and how gov't works. It was so off base that I don't even know where to begin. As soon as you read the into and the first chapter you'll notice that the author's propositions are whimsical at best. One thing is caring about our environment (I do), but to create this NGO (Non-Gov't org) to collect environemntal taxation is one of the most nonsensical ideas I've ever heard! Just do yourself a favor and don't buy this book, that is, unless you really want to make the author rich and make yourself miserable 
 I found this at a used bookstore. Was happy not to have my money go to the author. His arguments, like all the conspiracy theorists, are based on innuendo or explainable "discrepancies" in the evidence, which is  presented in a very selective manner. HEL ignores the truly compelling  evidence that shows that three shots and three shots only were fired at  JFK's car. He counts up to 6 shots. Where are the bullets? The shells? The  shooters? Several witnesses saw a rifleman in the Book Depository window.  No one reported seeing any other shooters, even though potential witnesses  were everywhere. Plus - 88% of the 178 witnesses said they were certain  they heard three shots. HEL doesn't bother to mention thi 
 This book is geared towards people who are unaware that they came from disfunctional families (with emphasis on alcohol abuse).  If you have already come to the conclusion that your family was disfunctional and begun the healing process this book is remedial.  There is a large emphasis on alcohol dependancy and abuse which I could not relate to.  The book should be retitled "Healing The Child Within: Discovery and Recovery for Adult Children of Alcoholic and Dysfunctional Families"  I felt that the book "Getting The Love You Want" by Harville Hendrix was more interesting and provided additional opportunities for discovery and growth 
 I previously left a very positive review of the shampoo and conditioner, however, after using it for several days, my hair feels heavy, dirty and coated with something.  I know Jonathan loves his product "Dirt" but it does not belong in a volumizing product for women with fine, limp hair.  I don't need anything else to weight my hair down.  It does not feel clean after washing and drying it.  I am quite disappointed as I really loved the way both products smelled. I had to wash my hair a second time today because it would not do what I wanted it to do and it felt like the "second day" after washing it. I still recommend the volumizing foam.  That is a nice product.  Smells wonderful and does not weight your hair down or cause it to become full of static as products with a lot of alcohol do. 
 I acquired this book because of the title: "The Power of Grammar."  The list from which I was choosing left off the subtitle, "Unconventional Approaches to Conventions of Language."  That would have been a clue that basically the authors, who claim a love for grammar, actually see conventions of "received" or "standard" English as restrictive to voice.    Some conventions they decry are the standard "do nots" like do not begin a sentence with a conjunction, do not split an infinitive, and do not end a sentence with a preposition.  They model their contempt for such convention.  On two pages, four sentences and one paragraph began with conjunctions.  (As a side note, the same two pages saw a simple series punctuated inexplicably with semicolon and a faulty use of parallelism with compound sentence later. Also on the next page, an introductory adverbial clause was left unadorned by comma.)  Okay, I'm probably just being picky.  The book addresses fanatics such as myself and notes that we are "erroneous" in our views.  I find it interesting that the authors and myself have read the same texts on achievement gap but have come to radically different viewpoints.  I believe that we must maintain an achieveable standard of English grammar so that it might be mastered by all, and the ruling class cannot simply change the rules to maintain a barrier of social mobility.  The authors seem to understand that viewpoint as they give voice to the concept, but then they disregard those conventions in favor of individual voice, which is important I grant.  However, I'd have entitled the book to reflect that emphasis.  One of the examples the authors use in the book as an exceptional use of fragments in writing is this: "When Chris caught you in tackle tag, he lowered you to the ground gently, so that you lay in his arms for a minute, looking up at him through the tangle of yellow hair, the green lawn wet below you.  Sticks in your back.  Blue eyes laughing at you.  Wild knowledge in your heart."   I would argue that while it's very poetic, the structure requires the reader to re-read.  First, you're looking up at the tangle of yellow hair, then you're looking at the green lawn wet below you?    I don't understand why the same passage could not be just as poetic using conventional style. For example, "When Chris caught you in tackle tag, he lowered you to the ground gently, so that you lay in his arms for a minute, looking up at him through the tangle of yellow hair. The green lawn wet below you sticks in your back.  Blue eyes laugh at you.  Wild knowledge floods (or pick any more appropriate verb) your heart."  Just my opinion. 
 There is a coliseum video about the World Heavyweight title. The tape ends when hogan was champ on his first reign. That tape is great. Gorilla Moonsoon with the commentary. The JR commentary doesn't make this garbage any better. The matches are like De ja vu let me think yes I have seen these before. Because these matches are on each and every other dvd. The extras on the dvd show the split seconds each title change. I really mean each clip has to be about 5 or 6 seconds. I know these matches were supposedly decided by the fans. I know I voted. Were the votes counted in Florida ? There are a million other matches that could have been on this dvd.  I got the first disc from Netflix because I was not going to buy it. Some may say "He is crazy it was great". Maybe for you it is. I have seen all of that before. I wanted this dvd to learn something new about that history. There are no perspective segments or interviews. Just overrated JR running his yap over matches he never called. I want to hear the real commentary with Jesse not JR. But WWE screwed that up. There are a lot of things just wrong about wrestling now...oh I mean Entertainment. It's garbage now. WWE has put out some good dvds its just they did a crappy job on this one. Hitman, Jake Roberts, Road Warriors, Monday Night etc etc. The dvds about the old days are the only things I look forward to because their current product is garbage. So when the thing I look forward to is as luckluster as this dvd sorry if I get a little ticked off. Experienced wrestling fan get it on Netflix or borrow it and go and get the Coliseum Video if you can find it. Rookie fan it would be informative to you. 
 "Well-behaved women rarely make history," a quote by Laural Thatcher Ulrich, American Historian, are the first words of this book.  That may very well be, but I don't think we have to try so hard to show children just how shocking some of our famous women were!  Lives of Extraordinary Women is a compilation of twenty short biographies of important women in the world's history: such well-known names as Joan of Arc, Marie Antoinette, and Harriet Tubman, as well as lesser-known individuals such as Nzingha, Gertrude Bell, and Aung San Suu Kyi.  Although it looks like biographies, there is really little intellectual value to the book.  It is merely a hodgepodge of trivia and unrelated gossip.    The first chapter is called "Cleopatra: Life at the Library."  Now, you would think that this would explore her love of reading and dertmination to build a world-famous library in Alexandria.  Instead, it is all about her numerous love-affairs, particularly the one with herself, experimenting with hairstyles, make-up, and perfume.  The author tells us, "...she coped with the required marriage to her ten year-old brother.  He turned up drowned, and another one was poisoned."    There is a chapter on Nzingha - a West African queen.  Some important aspects of her life we just must know are: "Rumor had her also murdering her nephew - and eating his heart," and "...she kept fifty young men as bodyguards...she made her favorites wear women's clothes."    It gets even better!  We simply can't live without knowing that Catherine the Great's husband, Peter, "heaped abuse on her, tortured their dogs...and brought his toy soldiers to bed, forcing her to participate in mock military maneuvers."    If the purpose of this book is to sensationalize the names of women in history, then it has met it's mark.  I'm not against books that attempt to amuse kids with humorous or unbelievable-but-true anecdotes.  I think the problem with this, however, is that today's educators are grabbing quickly for resources about women.  After ceturies of learning about history through the eyes of men, society is realizing that a big piece has been missing.  As educators, we are making a conscious effort to locate and use resources about women in history.  Because of this book's striking cover, catchy title, boldly illustrated caricatures, and interesting table of contents, we might be fooled into thinking this is a good book for our classrooms.  A careful reading of the pages will tell you a different story.    In the introduction, the author says, "Here are twenty women who wielded significant political power.  Each of these extraordinary women triumphed over attitudes and conditions that couldn't have been more adverse."  These statements make us think that they are women to look up to.  And, although she also says, "Not all of these women are role models," in the next sentence she says, "Their stories are offered here to inspire awe at the power of women throughout history - and ever after."  If these behaviors are the best we have to inspire awe at the power of women, our role in history is doomed for another twenty centuries!  A fun book of trivia, perhaps.  A book to enlighten and impart knowledge, I guess not 
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 This could have been one of the most important books of the year. Scott Ritter provides important, but tangential, information related to Israel's influence over U.S. foreign policy, the history of the IAEA in Iran, and the theory of regime change as the real reason for U.S. "concern" over Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure.  Unfortunately, Mr. Ritter misses on two counts. First, he offers little direct insight into the Bush administration's policy-making process. And second, someone forgot to edit the book. We are talking about gross grammatical errors, periods in the middle of a sentence, and even a sentence that is punctuated with both a question mark and a period. It is painful to read some of the paragraphs because they are so poorly constructed (at first, I thought my eyes were tired).  At least this book attempts to offer something better than the pablum provided by major media and NPR. It does provide some real insights into the workings of the IAEA, Israeli intelligence and exiled leaders-in-waiting who often lead U.S. policy astray.  Mr. Ritter is at his best when he stays close to his area of expertise - weapons inspections. This topic requires far more than that 
 The high points: 1) A cute doe-eyed heroine 2) Semi-logical plot and love-story sub-plot 3) Stylish photography and sets in some scenes  Low points: 1)Uma with a few months practice looked a lot more convincing.  With 1.5billion Chinese and Japanese people they couldn't find someone that looked cute and know which end of the sword to hold? 2) She's gets pummeled by the #2 female villan in midpoint of movie and then kills #1 male at the end. Not likely. 3) Her main defense seems to be to try to run away from the bad guys.  What's with that?  In two (maybe 3) encounters with the bad guys she tries to outrun them and then collapses in exhaustion.  Then when they soon catch up she fights them and mostly gets HER butt kicked. Then by luck or stupidty on enemy part she ends up winning.  4) The director misses an obvious opportunity to backlight her naked body through a white see through dress.  Cmon already!! 5) The CGI is pretty lame and done on the cheap.  One obvious tracking shot was jumping all over the screen.  In the extras the director even mentioned how they mounted the camera to the top of a car.  What, they couldn't even afford to RENT a steadicam for a 1/2 day or some better software.  I wouldn't buy it again.  Good thing it only cost me a little used 
 The essays were moderately amusing, but not a good use of my time. If you want short amusing essays, go for something like Gig or I Thought My Father Was God instead.  The advice given is often too general or too pointless to be useful (e.g., To Keep Warm -- eat right, keep your body in shape, have the right equipment; To Conduct a Background Investigation -- hire a private detective).  Maybe two of the essays were valuable if you really don't know how to tie a Winsor knot or a bow tie, but this isn't really the best way to find out because you'll never remember that the information is here and that's what the internet is for anyway 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 I am completely disgusted that she has the nerve to even think that! Sharon Rocha is Laci's voice. This book is just another in the long line of books in the Peterson cash cow extravaganza. "For Laci" is a much better choice if you want to read about the Peterson case 
 I agree with the reviewer who said that this novel is lacking any form of life. It is boring and trite and I couldn't finish it either. I usually always finish a book even if I'm not particularly enjoying it but this was beyond endurance. This is the only one of Mailer's novels I have attempted to read. I had seen Mailer interviewed a few times and this book confirmed my suspicion that he is a bag of wind. Mailer is an overblown, immature, egotistical narcissist 
 I'm sorry to say that this book is typical of christian books on sex.  The authors have a pre-determined opinion on a sexual subject, look for passages in the bible to support their opinion, then say that this proves they were right.  They, like most christian authors, use the more common MISTRANSLATIONS of the bible (e.g. King James Version) and also ignore the passages in the bible that contradict their opinions.  They also ignore what are the common interpretations of passages by biblical SCHOLARS (people who know what the bible means by studying the bible and related texts for most of their lives, along with the history and languages of the biblical cultures) and instead choose to believe whatever is the common interpretation that people they know have chosen.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  If you truly want to learn about sex, you should do so from someone with at least a rudimentary education.  God gave us a capacity for learning.  I don't believe he wanted us to blindly follow people who have no good reason for what they believe other than that's just what everyone they know thinks.  Also, the reason why so many women give high praises to this book in their reviews is that the author, since she is giving only opinions, tells misconceptions about what the bible says about sex that are believed by other women, thus reinforcing these misconceptions as well as earning praise for saying things with which others already wanted to believe.  If you are in a marriage, think very carefully about what the effect will be if you do (or more likely do NOT do) the things this book says 
 Esposito sure has a nice way of glossing over the truth.  The heart of the matter is missed and the fundamental force behind the Islamic faith is left in the corner of the closet somewhere.  Since he shared his ideas, and we do have 1st Amendment rights, here are mine - the Islamic faith and the teachings of the Koran are to drive the believer of these misconceptions with a goal of world domination - religiously and if necessary, violently.  How blatant and how clear the Koran is.  How necessary for us to realize that to stop the core of this terrorism is to stop the spread of this "religious system", or dare I/we say - militant system?  It's also time to put an end to political correctness 
 i love listening to roy play. one of my favorite things is to hear and see him live. w. any musician, in any setting. but this release just sucks.   nothing novel here. lame lyrics.   yeah, first track is alright, but the whole thing pisses me off b/c he can, and does, put out such better quality music when he plays live. i expect so much more of roy.  
 Nietzsche, who started all this, may or may not have been the deepest thinker since Socrates, but he was a stylistic virtuoso. Deleuze and Guattari, on the other hand, were founder members of a postmodern cult whose watchword is: obscurity = profundity. But while some profound things may be ineluctably obscure, by no means all obscure things are profound.  This book, which runs to 250 pages scarcely burdened by a coherently expressed thought, is in line for the prestigious prize, the Golden Merde de Taureau. It contains, along with much else, the authors' mature lucubrations on the foundations of calculus, which have greatly impressed readers who flunked high-school math. Others maintain that these passages are not about mathematics at all, just as the passages about science are not about science, and they may be right. What, if anything, it is about is anyone's guess, and many have speculated, some to their own satisfaction. One thing we can be sure of, because the authors tell us: they are creating concepts. This important work should not be undertaken by those in whom unfortunate defects of education have left a residual respect for language and joined-up thought.  The book was a bestseller in France - possibly the most unread bestseller since a 'A Brief History of Time', but for different reasons 
 The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the "Just say no" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack 
 Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?  Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!  Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter.   The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.  Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not.  
 This volume is a book about something.  But its not about Robert Johnson, its not about escaping the Delta, and its hardly about the blues.  It is more a rambling chronology of popular music, and the ways in which Blues is nested into that overall context.  It is as much or more about musicians other than blues musicians.  And when it focuses on "blues musicians", it goes to great and repeated lengths to demonstrate they were not really "Blues" musicians at all.  We understand them to be such today, the author labors, because Blues sold.  In fact, the author repeats, the "Blues" musicians we have come to revere liked to play, and did play, other kinds of music as much or more than blues, including ragtime, tin pan alley, fife and drum and spirituals.  See?  They weren't really blues players at all.  They were versatile musicians forced into this genre by the music business, many of them preferring to play something other than blues.  Huh.  Further, the author posits that latter day (white?) blues musicians are not really playing the blues either.  They are acting "as if", affecting musical styles and inflections that are not their own.  Sort of make believe blues performing.  Imitating the blues musicians of yore, and not authentically expressing themselves in their own right.  Despite Fred McDowell's and John Lee Hooker's assertion that "the Blues is a feeling", the author would apparently have us believe that it was only THEIR feeling, not one available to others.  Suffice it to say, the author and I do not share a fundamental view of what the Blues is.  Would I buy, read, or reccommend this book.  No, no and no.  It isn't what it says it is.  And what it is is superficial in its depth of understanding of Blues expression, and how and where that happens 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 Halfway into the story, my kids asked if we could read something else. I suspect this may be a book that appeals more to adults than to children. The art work is beautiful and the plot worthwhile, but the narrative voice is so distant and emotionless--I expect that is probably what turned my kids off. The girl, the tribe, and the animals don't have names. The piece reads like a prologue rather than a story 
 No true Christian would ever buy this.  God is not saying any of this!  The author is projecting his own opinions as the voice of God. These books are false doctrine!  What is sad is that people truly searching for God's word may come upon this baloney and really believe these are God's words, especially young people.  These are not God's words!  And shame to Scholastic for carrying these books at their school book fairs!  I know there is freedom of speech, but if you are going quote God, you had better get it right.  You will have to face God on your judgement day 
 this is a great book...if you 15 and you've finaly run out of ravenwolf books to read ...otherwise...save your money.  While some of his visualization excersises are interesting, its pretty obvious, even before you read the rest of his books, that he's building up to admiting he's not a wiccan or even pagan, he's heading for satanist...or a drug treatment center, whichever comes first. And I have no problem with that, but lets call this what it is...pandering to disafected teenagers, angsty 20 somethings and bitter 30's. If you need something to put on your coffee table to annoy visiting Jehovah's witneses or to scare your parents...this is the author and these are the books, but if your looking for useful information.. its not in here 
 Pat Robertson is not a Christian.  A Christian is one who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ, who spoke of a loving, peaceful and forgiving God who loves everyone as his children. Robertson speaks of a God who destroys cities with hurricanes for the actions of a few immoral people, who will abandon an entire town to destruction because they didn't want ID crap in their schools, who almost kills world leaders for trying to make peace, who doesn't care if people contract a deadly virus if they had sex before marriage, and who will basically consign to enternal torture everyone not of Robertson's belifs. This particular book "exposes" the "attack" on Christianity in an 80% Christian country by the untold millions of radical left-wing atheist secularists. The problem with this theory is that the radical left-wing atheist secularists don't exist, except for about maybe three people. Atheists are generally tolerant of other's belifs, and though I'm a Christian I would sooner believe in no God than in Robertson's vengeful, destructive god. If Robertson--God forbid--ever becomes president, I will seriously consider leaving the country before it becomes a theocracy. Don't buy any of his books, or anything related to him, because you'll only make him more grossly rich than he already is. (Actually, I'd rather assume he's a greedy fake than what he appears to be and says he is, but still.) If Christ were on earth today, He would condemn Robertson as He did the Pharisees and hypocrites 
  I was not all that crazy about Alanis's Jagged Little Pill when it was all the rage.  Then came Sheryl Crow's whinning about how "Everyday Is A Winding Road" and how her man done bring her "Anything But Down".  And Alanis's JLP album was  rendered a better listen than Crow's cry-baby singing.   I enjoyed Crow's "All I Wanna Do" and she, again suprised me with her doing of "The First Cut Is The Deepest" and I wish she would stay within those boundries in her singing because she is enjoyable that way.  
 This book is *very* selective in the issues it takes on.  Now my review may well be seen as pointless whining, because it is quite common in the feminist movement for people to get irritated that their own causes are not well represented.  However, I so strongly believe this to be the case here that I'm going to complain anyway.  The feminist issues I care about most are rape and child sexual abuse (which often includes rape, but not always).  Guess what:  they are barely mentioned.  Rape is mentioned twice:  once in the context of abortion, and once in the context of violence against women.  It gets a cursory listing along with a bunch of other types of violence, such as domestic violence and hate crimes.  Both these exceedingly brief listings give a very false picture of what rape is.  It is not a situation that usually leads to abortion:  the majority of rape victims do not become pregnant.  Some do, but most do not.    Also, rape is not an issue of violence against women.  It is an issue of violence from the powerful directed at the powerless.  So women, children (of both sexes, girls more often, but boys as well) and powerless men, such as those in prison, are victims.  Rape victims (as reported by the Justice Department) tend to be quite young, with the vast majority under age 30, a large percentage under age 20, and an all-too-high number of children under age 12.  Viewing this as "violence against women" when so many of the victims are children or teenagers, obscures the issue.  But if this book is a guide, the feminist movement doesn't care at all about rape/child sexual abuse victims, and they are not discussed.  None of the excellent books out there are listed (and there are many far more recent than The Courage To Heal, which is 18 years old now).  The neglect of rape is so complete that the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) is not even listed in the resource guide.  Of course the majority of women are not raped, but some are, and there can be quite difficult psychological fallout from it, especially in cases of more than one perpetrator, which we seem to have particular difficulty facing in society.  African-American rape survivors as well as those from very conservative cultures report additional difficulties coping with the aftermath.  But forget a nuanced treatment of this topic:  the very topic itself is virtually unmentionable in this book, so any discussion of its complexity is of course nonexistent.  And by the way, talking about rape is not necessarily whining or "playing the victim card."  It is a way to try to remedy unjust situations and improve the quality of life for women, children, and some powerless men who have been victimized.  Stating the reality of abuse in one's life is *not* the same as saying one wants to be a perpetual victim - in fact, in my opinion, the reverse is true.  Perpetual victimhood is much more likely when the difficult post-assault issues are not discussed and the impact of the assault(s) is not faced.  That's when some people get stuck.  There is a balance between dwelling on things too much and not discussing them at all - this book won't help anyone with that.  Instead, we get the same old, same old.  Fight for abortion rights!  Vote!  Champion motherhood!  Etc. ad nauseum.  Feminists have been saying this stuff for so long, and no one is listening.  Maybe because they've been framing the same old issues in the same old way for so long, no one but the converted cares anymore, despite the real threats to rights.  I'm not saying these topics are unimportant.  They are very important, but yet more exhortations and calls to action are not likely to succeed - they haven't yet, anyway.  But a book that so completely leaves out a cause I am passionate about - forget my becoming involved in any kind of movement, based on these views.  I can only hope she is quite nonrepresentative.  Instead of my becoming involved with NARAL or NOW or Planned Parenthood, my charitable dollars are going to RAINN, which is where they have been going.  This book shows that feminists in the organized movement are as capable as any other human being of evading difficult issues.  When combined with the pep-talk, exhortation to 'join the movement' that this author engages in, the result leaves me feeling *exceptionally* irritated.    She does get one star though because her point that women need to be much more politically involved and vote regularly is well taken.  I'll probably donate this to the library, in hopes that someone else will get more benefit from it.  
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 Great book! I bought one for me and her. Tells you everything you could ever need to know or ask about starting and keeping a yonger man older woman relationship alive and well.  BUT: After many years with the love of my life aged 55 and I 22.  She had an affair on me and broke up with me two weeks ago!!  She had everything she could have ever needed in this world but she got gready and wanted more so she went for the money man.  Love ment nothing to her, I guess I was just her part time "Boy Toy" until she found better.  I am CRUSHED I loved that woman more then life itself.  Now she won't even talk to me.  She had a frind of her's tell me that it would have never worked out and that I should move on with my life find someone younger and have kids, even though I told her I didn't want kids.  So guys listen up before you end up just like me.  STAY AWAY because the pain will be worse then all the good you ever had 
 This is a great book but it is excessive. John Stossel has a proof that proves global warming is a myth and its really simple to remember.  We are better offf now then we where before. There is more pollution now then before. Therefore pollution is good and global warming is a myth.  Think about IRaq or North Korea, they dont have pollution and they are not as good as us. or even think about Alaska it doesnt have much pollution and no one wants to live there because it sucks. Thats why we need to start drillin up there and git some pollution going.  But what I really liked about this book is that the author isnt afraid of getting rid of professors tenure. I tried getting a job at the university in my state and guess what, they turned me down just cuz im not a communist atheist but ive been teaching science for 20 years and I know the Bible like the ack of my hand! i even told them that and they still wouldnt let me teach 
 I am rather disappointed after buying this book. It contains just a bunch of articles about different chess topics, illustrated (mainly) with the author games. The articles are rather interesting and well written, games well annotated but ...  it is hard to find the idea behind the book as a whole.  I would rate it higher if it had title like 'Alex Yermolinsky selected chess articles'. But this book does not offer any organized plan of work towards reader chess improvement (ohh, there is suggestion to study own games on the beginning). So I am just disappointed after buying it 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 This is not a good movie for children, though you won't know this until the end of the movie, when the otter is cruelly and senselessly killed.  My 11 year old son cried himself to sleep.  The scenary is beautiful and for the most part, so is the story.  It is too bad that the ending was not better considered, instead it comes out of nowhere. 
 The author is a biologist, but wasn't able to explain the science behind the story in a way that I could follow.  That's not usually fatal, since I'm used to being left behind when the hard scientists start talking, but it certainly doesn't help. And I remain puzzled by her creatures who have only two genders although their DNA is a triple helix.  She tried to explain the mating and reproduction, but it seemed forced and unneccessary.  Her prose, at best is servicable.  Again, it's not fatal (Asimov is no great sylist, either), but the combination of impenetrable science and clunky writing kept getting in the way of the story.  The worst flaw is that her characters do not develop at all.  Most of the time I found myself simply not caring what happened to them, particularly since they were pretty much either all good or all bad.  And there was never any doubt in my mind that the goodies would prevail.  The most interesting character--a six year old girl with a fantastic penchant for prime numbers--was introduced in the first sentence but soon was shuttled off to a mad scientist's lab and only appeared occasionally after that.  One of the reasons I managed to get all the way to the end was that I kept hoping she'd reappear and take center stage.  Not worth reading, IMHO 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 There are no instructions as mentioned before but my biggest complaint is that the card would not fit into the slot in the back of the computer.  The usb ports and firewire ports were made wider than any standard pci card should be.  In order to get it to work I had to squeeze the metal on the top and bottom of each port down until it would fit into the slot.  Very frustrating and just wrong, looking at the other reviews though, maybe I just got a fluke card.  The usb 2.0 ports work fine once installed and I haven't had a chance to try out the firewire ones 
 Don't but this little book! It has less information than most of the magizine articles that are the basis of the author's knowledge base.  It is unclear if the author has ever meet,interviewed or seen Mr. Waits preform.  Huge omissions and years of information are not present.  Some facts like the fact Tom had a relationship with Ricky Lee Jones or the first 3 albums for Island are a "Trilogy" are mentioned numerous times in a attempt to pad this books 150 double spaced pages.  It looks and reads like a bad high school term paper 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I gave this to my kid for christmas, and he never opened it until today. But the bad news it doesn't work on any of the players we have at home. It clearly says on the cover SACD surround sound "Plays only on". wow. I never heard of that. Any suggestions? It doesn't say that it requires a special player on the ad. Very disappointed 
 Utter nonsense. Don't waste your money or your eyesight 
 In an impulsive moment, I bought this book on the strength of its Amazon pairing with that other book about the pharmaceutical industry, and the five-star reviews. And only after reading it do I wonder how many of those reviewers might be associates of Dr. Kassirer himself. This is not a five-star book, folks; it is one long smear from beginning to end that seems to paint the entire medical profession with the same sticky, filthy brush. Yes, there is a fair amount of spice along the way--isn't that always true of "exposes"?--but the whole seems much less than the sum of its parts. For my money, there isn't NEARLY enough hard data here to support the sorts of dour conclusions the author would have us accept on his say-so. 
 I have this setup with my new laptop that runs Vista premium.  The device installs ok and it works with media center.    It's great for watching tv, but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in "standby" mode until it's time to record, you may be disappointed.  When coming out of standby, sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not. When it's not recognized, I have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized.  Because of this, I have missed several recordings.  I contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby.  
 I loved this when we first got it home. I'm handicapped and can't push a big vacuum. So, this was just right to pick up the "top & showing" dirt until the housekeeper could get here once a week.   But after two months the AC adapter cord just snapped in half. It was oddly brittle from the very beginning. I contacted Euro Pro who would not replace it under warranty. So, I ordered a new adapter from them (which came to approx. $15) with shipping.  Now six weeks later, they sent me a card saying "due to overwhelming demand....." the adapter is on back order. I wonder why they have such a large demand? Funnily enough, the cleaner has still been working for the whole six weeks on it's last charge. But, no more.  I think it's time to bury it and move onto an old fashioned (no power) push sweeper 
 This book gets two stars for being well-written, having cute pictures, and being fun to read.  However, I am concerned about the content.  If you want to bring up your children to resist peer pressure, then this might not be a good choice. I'm sure the author didn't intend anything bad, but when the hippo finally goes along with the crowd to have some fun, some alarms go off in my head.   Clearly the hippo's struggle was with shyness, and the other animals certainly weren't doing anything "bad," but when my daughter encounters situations where others are having fun but she's struggling with her moral compass, I want her to have the strength to leave that situation and find some different friends who have their heads on straight.  When my daughter's a little older I'll ask her to help me write an alternate ending for this book, in which the hippo will find some real friends who respect his values and like him because of who he is, not because of what he does 
 I just had a hard time reading/understanding/finishing this book. I did finally finish it because I wanted to know the mystery behind the author's father, but in the end the whole book was disappointing. I guess it's a matter of the book's structure. The author jumps from one time setting to another so often, it gets totally confusing! Also she intertwines different stories of different family members and other people in her life, that it's easy to confuse the characters. Some of the language sounds awkward, the curse words seem...forced. Also after a while, the author's unceasing bitterness towards life tended to grate on my nerves 
 This kit is horrible if you are not an experienced artist.  The 32 page book is poorly written.  The projects inside are well beyond the beginners level.    The "instruction" in this booklet is very vague.  It provides not direction on HOW to do what it ask.  The materials in this kit are horrible at best.  For just a bit more than what you pay for this kit you can buy a very professional sketching kit.    If you are a beginner (you wouldn't be looking at this product if you weren't, right?) avoid this product at all cost.  there is MUCh better instruction out there and you will quickly out grow the poor quality supplies that come in the kit 
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 I bought the book due to the reviews, even though I have seen this couple on tv and wondered about them. I found this book way too fantastical. Some of the stories were waaaay out there! I don't even think they investigated any of the cases. Not all of the stories dealt with ghost, some banshees,demons. Also very short book. I wondered if they just wrote down passed down stories 
 Barrett has no qualifications to judge alternative medicine. He is clearly a lobbyist for the status quo. If you are interested in alternatives, you will not get any useful information here 
 I had the tape in high school when it first came out and  I bought the CD very recently for two songs in particular. The first, the title track, is a classic. The last track "Jack U Off" is a weird and wonderful mix of electro keyboards, New Wave-ish rhythms,  a sing-song melody, and incredibly raunchy lyrics. The remainder of the album is for me, forgetable. 
 Both this book and the "Red" book mislead readers by listing "price values" that are blatently low,-on the very uncommon items listed, even though the pricing errors were brought to both author's attention years ago. Many revisions later, they remain for the most part unchanged. Shame on them 
 Amazon does not provide for additional responses to feedback responses so my only recourse to refuting this company's false claims is through product review. I wrote a negative feedback on January 25. I notice that this company responds very aggressively to ALL negative feedback. They said of my feedback that it was "blatantly untrue" because I said that they do not permit returns. Here is THEIR OWN PUBLISHED statement from Amazon's site regarding returns of certain products: * Pillows, orthopedic soft goods, supports, braces and other non-returnable health care items. To maintain our deeply discounted pricing and for your safety and protection, regional health laws and hygienic concerns render us unable to accept returns on all pillows, orthopedic soft goods, braces, supports, hot/cold therapy items, electrodes or any other item that comes in contact with the skin once it is evident it has been opened and removed from its original packing. We will accept returns on unopened products.   Now I ask:  how could one ever determine the usability of a product like this WITHOUT OPENING IT?!! Absurd. This company needs to seriously review its tone and attitude towards its customers. What I wrote is true and their own statement proves it. Furthermore, I left my feedback on January 25 and they said I "bought this almost two months ago" when IN FACT I ordered it on December 16 and received it after that. They are not truthful in public and posted in opposition to a FACTUAL feedback statement. Their rude, dishonest and aggressive response says all that needs to be said about their customer service! I did not like the product at all, but I REALLY dislike their customer service. 
 Don't get me wrong -- "On Growth and Form" is one of my absolute top favorite books of all time. Possibly my favorite book, in fact. This review is a warning to make sure you get the right imprint.   Unfortunately some publishers think that they know better than D'Arcy Thompson, and cut out more than half of the original material. After all, nobody these days actually looks at equations, right?  Well I do, and the pathetic edition by Canto (368 pages) weighs with less than 33% of the material in the modern unexpurgated reprint by Dover (1116 pages).   Amazingly enough, the redacted Canto version costs nearly the same as the Dover complete. If you care about this material, take care to get all of it 
 Unfortunately, "Speed and Politics" shares an identical ISBN with "Remarks on Marx" by Michel Foucault, from the same publisher. Hence, the confusion in the customer reviews 
 After watching the 1 Ultimate Avengers I was expecting a another action packed romp through the park, but I realized this was truly anti-climatic. The HULK make the 1st movie extremely appealing with his rip-roaring rampage while decimating everything. I expected to see even more of the HULK this time and pretty much got nothing. Yuk for the sidekicks (No offense all the other hero's are just sidekicks to the HULK) blah, blah. While the Black Panther was cooler than I thought he would be, This was boring. WHERE WAS THE HULK???? Marvel, can you please do an American Icon like the HULK some love and give him some air time? HULK MUST SMASH and I cheered when he did (finally) show up but sorry this movie was mostly lame. Well, I bought it and I am stuck with it. I am feinding for the HULK to take it somebody (Villan or Hero) and open up a can o whup- @zzz. Please Marvel enough with the Aliens, there are some really cook villians in the Marvel Universe (Really Cool) and I have been a fan of the Avengers for decades but as much as I like Indepence Day The Movie, this Avengers seemed more like a knock off. Do yourself a favor wait until it comes on Cartoon Network or something, this was truly mediocre. HULK SMASH!!!! 
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 Maybe that's because it was given to me for free while I was in the hospital... by someone who was happy to give it away.  For that matter, as soon as I got out of the hospital I passed it on to a friend who was in a car accident and can't walk.  There was no suspense of disbelieve.  I have more faith in the existence of santa claus than I do in the circumstances surrounding the pseudo-characters found in this novel 
 This book is pure heresy clothed in feel-good, new age sounding terminology. The author blatantly states that he doesn't believe in the basic dogmas of the Christian faith, such as the virgin birth, the physical resurrection, or what he calls the "traditional" redemption and atonement of Jesus Christ. He also does not take the bible at all literally. Granted, there is much spiritual depth to scripture; however, excessive spiritualizing of scripture can lead to this type of "enlightened" Christianity.  His concepts are not Christian, but emphasize the divine nature of mankind while downplaying the role and true divinity of Christ. This is all subtly concealed under the guise of a re-interpretation of the "true" gospel message.  Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of scripture can see the errors in the author's observations and conclusions.   The author has dabbled in mysticism - unfortunately not Christian mysticism as experienced by the myriad of saints of the Roman Catholic Church. This book should in no way serve as a reflection of catholicism for anyone seeking to discover the true Roman Catholic faith. 
 i had to rate this book one star because there was no "ZERO"!  This book is complete garbage and the worst investment you can make to start your investment career.  There are other books on investing in this series, which do an incredible job for beginners.  Even the resource centers at any decent online broker has better information for you than this book has and the links won't go bad 
 I really wasn't a big fan of the book.  It's kinda boring 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks  
 I am a Rita Mae Brown fan and have been from her early novels on.  I own and have read all of the "Mrs. Murphy" Mystery series.  This book is awful.  I can't believe she wrote it. I had to force myself to finish it.  Characters did things that didn't work.  The writing was just plain bad. Technical facts about wine and grapes and terrorism and you name it are thrown together and not wrapped in much story. Even the dialog is flat. I've enjoyed every topic Ms. Brown has tackled in the past because of her excellent writing so I concluded she is either ill, has writer's block, or had a crazy deadline that stopped the creative juices. Read any of the other books in the series, but don't bother with this one 
 This is one of the ONLY books by Nora Roberts I can actually say I didnt like. It was SO dissapointing I got mad everytime I looked at it. This books is about Oliva and Noah... THE END. That is practically what it is. It started off when they were both younger, them meeting when they were older and them meeting YET AGAIN WHEN THEY ARE MATURE. I guessed the story RIGHT from the beginning, and I hardly could ever do that before in any of Nora Robert's books. I hate to say it, but I DONT reccomend this book. It was really waste of time. What happened to the quality work of Ms. Roberts 
 Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots, and bulls though 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 This is one of those weird manufactured bands - y'know, the kind that never really toured or played much or released much - and then suddenly, mysteriously, they're signed to a major label and making more money than your parents.  First of all, these guys are upper-middle-class hipsters who pretend to be poor.  It's a schtick.  Having lived in Seattle, I've been privvy to these creeps up close.  Ben Clark is not struggling I assure you.  Their music is lightweight pop-fluff that tries to adopt the surface appeal of punk without being the slightest bit punk at all.  They have no identity of their own, and somehow it all feels way outdated.  It's those slimey major labels with their cynical idea of what makes money - they simply regurgitate what's already popular until the well runs dry.  They don't care about creativity.  They just want stupid disposable pop for stupid mall kids to spend their money on.  Some greasy white guy in a polo shirt thinks he knows what teenage girls like and so the rest of us are stuck with yet another boring disposable hunk of plastic junk.  All this while truly talented deserving bands go broke.  Go spend all your money on the Lashes 
 I found this book hard to follow.  The author put a lot of effort into trying to make this an easy book.  There are 79 hand pictures of the basic hand claps with the movements described in words, but I just can't get it.  Music notes are included for each rhyme.  I wish the author would have included rhythym as well.  I have yet to use it with my students 
 I had great expectations of this book but the more I read the worse it got. For a person who is supposed to be an 'Orientalist' he sure does hate his subject. Under cover of being a scholar Lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning. This ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the Middle East today. Powerful people listen to Lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the Muslim world.

 GREAT BOOK!  A great story with some mild, nose wrinkling, yucky stuff in all of the bugs the frog eats!  My 4,5 and 7 year old all enjoy this one.  I like asking the Kindergarteners if they are ready for lunch after I read it to them.  Great rhymes and fun pictures as well.  Another fabulous book with Karma Wilson's magic touch!  Great gift idea 
 Mathematicians would favor this book. The text is dense and dry. The material is presented in the most boring manner possible. Atkins prefers to explain himself with equations rather than words. The subject matter is not thoroughly explored. No concepts are placed into the "big picture." At best, this book could serve as a decent reference for a chemist or physicist already familiar with the topics and therefore only in need of review. Learning physical chemistry for the first time using this book is a serious chore. I honestly believe that physical chemistry can be a fun, exciting, and challenging subject that is worth learning. This book fails to deliver the material in a manner that does anything but annoy and frustrate. This problem is only compounded by the fact that there are numerous mathematical errors present both in the text and in the solutions of selected problems. If you are stuck using this book because it was required for a class, I suggest you find supplementary material that elaborates better on the many areas in which this book is lacking 
 This DVD really hurt my back.  I did the easier of the Yin workouts and my back hurt for two days.  I would highly recommend Baron Baptise, Kathy Smith and/or Bryan Kest if your looking for a good yoga workout that won't cause pain 
 This instant-expert in Hawaiiana is evidently one of those people who move to Hawaii and think "it's much too good for the Hawaiians so I'll sell as much of it as I can".  The photography is good but so many of the descriptions are soooooo wrong that I looked through it in slack-jawed amazement.  Don't fall for this phoney-baloney aloha - the real Hawaii is not for sale, no matter how many books you write badly about it

 I would just like to say right off that around 10 years ago I was a whole bean coffee addict and had to have it all the time, so I know what I speak of.   I bought and made my own high octane stuff at home and work, and have tried Starbucks when out with friends and family, many of whom are fans.     Get off it people, you will feel a million bucks better!   (Oh is that a Starbucks pun?)   Well not meaning to, but fits.     I know most of you will read this and go, just don't go then, it's your choice.   Ah, the real point.  My intentions are calling to the mat that things like this are overall harmful to people's health, so thus, everything that goes along with it, the high, the money making, is outweighed by the bad.    For I know many people that get seriously crabby without their fix, for I know many people that are to hyper and moody from to much coffee, for I know many people that have many other better places to spend money but are more and more in dept thanks to draining 100 bucks or more a month into JUST COFFEE!    Then there are the long term medical issues that no doubt come into play from long term caffeine use.   And it's going to be even way more so in the future from places that sell this "higher octane" junk.   For its even more addicting that ever now, thus more long term damage.   And no I am not perfect.   But I know how much better I fell since I got off this stuff and add to that I am older so I should be even more tired, as per aging?  Right?  Right.   I blow past everyone I know in the mornings that is on this stuff.     Have you ever noticed people around the office that don't drink coffee are spunky and chipper in the morning?  Less drag? Less Lag?  I Never used to notice, till I stopped.    Try it.   Not cold turkey, for it's like a drug.   And doesn't that say allot?  When you HAVE to have something in your body, other than food and water, doesn't that mean anything????????????      No, go ahead, mock me, so take a sip of your tweak, and hit the disagree button,   Think I don't have anything better to do, when I do only maybe some people will see the light when they read this and back off this junk.     But remember this, I am not the one that is going to have heath problems later from this stuff and my cash goes farther.    Drink up, Smile    Starbucks has many detractors -- people who object to its business model, the way it prepares its beans, or simply its ubiquity.  ( you mean prepares its speed )    It's important to understand that "The Starbucks Experience" is not, and is not meant to be, an "exposé" of Big Coffee. People seeking that should look elsewhere.   ( no its about how can I get my fix on legal speed, I call it these people, "get their  tweak on", and they think its funny in the morning when I say that to them, interestingly the same response my brother used to give me when I see him snort blow )   What "The Starbucks Experience" is, is a very interesting inside look at the approach to business that has made Starbucks not only a commercial, but also a cultural, phenomenon.     ( right, give people anywhere around the world a legal reason to get high, and they will, remember, real speed was legal till not to long ago, so now we have just invented a way to circumvent the laws, brilliant)       As William C. Taylor and Polly LaBarre explained in their recent and important book "Mavericks at Work," Starbucks is an exemplar of the values-driven business model that will set apart the next generation of business leaders.  ( selling speed is not "values driven" ) hilarious!       Joseph Michelli has taken us "deeper" inside that business model and pointed out some important ways that all of us, whatever our job or station in life, can adopt and adapt "the Starbucks experience" for our own uses.    (Yea, let's add to it all the fast food places poisoning everyone also, is that "deeper" enough for you?  )     I think the attentive reader will come away with many worthwhile ideas. We're not all in a position to shape corporate policy, but one of the powerful truths Starbucks teaches is that everyone can have a big -- even a defining -- impact on a customer's experience of your product or service. You don't have to be a Starbucks fan to get a mental caffeine-buzz off an idea like that.  Yea Starbucks is -defining--alright, lets all get high with a little help from my friends  Mm I get high with a little help from my friends Mm going to try with a little help from my friends   (Do you need tweak anybody?) I need some tweak to love (Could it be anybodies tweak?) No I want Starbucks tweak to love  Oh no, someone is going to say, oh look he is quoting rock and roll, isn't that from the devil? Isn't that bad? WORSE?  caught ya thinking haha  
 Maya Angelou is an expert at writing easily remembered catchphrases and proverbial tidbits that have all the taste of wisdom with half the calories.  She fills her fans with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, she inspires them, she makes them feel as if she speaks The Truth.  In other words, she's great at writing motivational proverbs.  She is not, however, a poet.  Not even close.  She displays virtually no poetic craft and shows no real skill at compression, imagery, figurative language, and metaphor, to name a few tools that make a piece of writing a poem.  At best, this collection would bore the pants off of any serious reader of poetry.  At worst, it will make them want to gouge their eyes out with a pair of #6 knitting needles.  If you think this is poetry, you haven't read any poetry yet 
 Hornsby's great, no doubt; but this shabby packaging of one of his PBS shows is irritating.  The only real work that has been done has the been the 5.1 audio mix--the rest is just lifted from the broadcast; with interviews conducted over the solos and instrumental sections to mask sloppy edits to fit more songs into the one hour program.  Undoubtedly, the unedited concert exists in one form or another.  I would have sacrificed the surround sound mix for an unedited 'Mandolin Rain', or hear the soprano sax solo unmarred in 'End of the Innocence'.  Almost a waste of time and money.  Almost 
 Don't buy this book, please! The man is a complete fake. He's degrees are totally worthless. He is making money off of people looking for help and tricked into believing his marketing hype. Just do some research on Google and you'll discover the truth about him 
 Just having read Julia Child's "My Life In France";Anthony Bourdain's "The Nasty Bits;, and, Bill Buford's "Heat" (all beautifully and wryly written); I found Ms. Greene's memoir sleazy and extremely self-absorbed.  Ms. Greene was living in a halcyon period of evolution in the history of cooking in America; but alas, she was more engaged in her own glorification.  Way too much self-promotion and not much real information on the wonderful awakening of Americal's taste buds and techniques in the kitchen 
 I estimate that I have read about 2000 books in my life, and I would rate this as the worst!  The basic principle is that to be at your best, you have to abandon the things that you need to do, like go to work and take care of your home so that you can "get into the zone."  This happens when you enter some sort of "energy spectrum" which aligns some sort of magnetic fields.  I bought this book because it's title seems to indicate a scientific element to self help.  I am a physicist and found that intriguing.  Don't be fooled like I was.  The author tries to use scientific words to substantiate spooky, ridiculous ideas.  WOW, this was bad! 
 THurow gives us scaring moments through all the book, to finish it with a ludicrous positive message of about just two paragraphs !  He did a good research about World Globalization, he blamed  old people all around the  world for the crisis in the Welfare State, he gave empty clues for solving  this problems. Anyway, its good to know the real face of Capitalism, as  Marx had predicted a long time ago, but that had been held at bay by the  Welfare State politics post World War II. But, like he says, theres no  other system available but Capitalism. In other words: if you are rich,  youll get richer; if youre poor, youre dead 
 Loved The Magus.  Kept waiting for this one to take off.  Save for the one chapter on his first love - about three-quarters of the way through - I found little worth hanging onto.  Great observations about L.A. and the  film biz.  Colorful  descriptions of English countryside and the Nile  Delta.  But, sorry, none of it worth the 600+ page plod 
 So many Evangelicals who have a foolish disdain for Pentecostals, because of an understandable distaste for "Charismania" (which has very little to do with Pentecostalism), know so little about Dr. John MacArthur, I'm compelled to write on the man. Here are the facts on "his doctrine" to ponder:  The April 1986 edition of Faith For The Family quotes Dr. MacArthur as saying in a 1976 article entitled, "Not His Bleeding But His Dying" "It was His death that was efficacious. . not His blood. . . Christ did not bleed to death. The shedding of blood had nothing to do with bleeding. . . it simply means death. . . Nothing in His human blood saves...It is not His blood that I love. . . it is Him. It is not His bleeding that saved me, but His dying." It is incredible to me, that a Christian minister would make such statements.  He Does Not Like Rev. 1:5 In The KJV  In "Not His Bleeding But His Dying," MacArthur had this to say: "I may add a note on Revelation 1:5, a passage which is confusing in the King James Version. The word 'washed' is not correct. The Greek work is 'delivered.' '' With that statement, I would like to take issue. "And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood'' (Rev. 1:5). What could possibly be confusing about that? He says that ''washed'' is incorrect and that it should be "delivered." Like most "great" scholars today, MacArthur suffers from the Westcott and Hort syndrome. "Washed" is in the Textus Receptus, and is so rendered by George Ricker Berry in his Interlinear Greek-English New Testament. In his invaluable footnotes, Berry reveals those responsible for trying to change the reading of this verse. The word was changed by Lachmann, 1842- 1850, Tischendorf, Eighth Edition, 1865- 1872, and Tregelles, 1857- 1872. These are three of the men that laid the groundwork for Westcott and Hort, so that they could make the alarming changes in their Revised Version. The American Standard Version, 1901, of course went along with the change, but they did put in a significant footnote. While rendering the word as "loosed," their footnote says, "Many authorities, some ancient, read washed."  I do not agree with the change as found in the ASV, when it reads "Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our sins by his blood." Nor do I agree with the NIV as it reads, "To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood." However, whether it is rendered "washed," "loosed," "freed," or "delivered," it is still "by" or "in" His blood that this is done. While the ASV, the NASV, and the NIV definitely weaken the verse, neither one of them will really let MacArthur off the hook. Whether washed from our sins, or delivered from our sins, it is still only by the blood.  MacArthur Sounds Like Bratcher On The Blood  In his commentary on Hebrews, pages 236 to 237, I find further alarming statements as he deals with Hebrews 9:16-22. While he does say some good things, he clearly is talking in circles. When he says that "blood is a symbol of death," he sounds very much like the apostate Dr. Robert G. Bratcher, who translated the "Good News For Modern Man." This is what Bratcher believed, so he felt free to change "blood" to "death" in Eph. 1:7, Heb. 10:19, and Rev. 1:5. He changed "blood" to "sacrifice" in I Pet. 1:19. He also managed to leave out blood, or substitute another word in Matt. 27:4,24,25; Acts 5:28; 17:26, 20:28; Rom. 3:25, 5:9 Col. 1:20; Eph. 2:13, and Rev. 5:9. Of course Bratcher's "Good News Bible" is one of the most corrupt translations of the 20th Century. It would appear that in regard to the blood at least, that MacArthur and Bratcher are on the same wave length.   Why Pit His Blood Against His Death?  MacArthur states that, "It was not Jesus' physical blood that saves us, but His dying on our behalf, which is symbolized by the shedding of His physical blood. If we could be saved by blood without death, the animals would have been bled, not killed, and it would have been the same with Jesus." I have never heard of anyone teaching that Jesus only needed to bleed a little to save us, and not to die. Numerous passages of Scripture tell us that Christ died for our sins. This is found in I Cor. 15:3, as well as many other places. If anyone denied this, I would object very strenuously to their denial, but my question is, why does it have to be His "death" or His ''blood"? It is both His "death" and His "blood" that are important according to the Bible.  How can MacArthur truthfully make the following statement? "Again, however, we need to keep in mind that the blood was a symbol. If Christ's own physical blood, in itself, does not cleanse from sin, how much less did the physical blood of animals. " (Emphasis ours.) Many passages of Scripture reveal that he is dead wrong in his approach.  What Does The Scriptures Say?  The elders were admonished "to feed the church of God, which he bath purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28). Redemption and remission of sins cannot be apart from "faith in his blood" (Rom. 3:24,25). We are "justified by his blood" (Rom. 5:9). "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins. . . " (Eph. 1:7). We "are made nigh by the blood of Christ" (Eph. 2:13). "We have redemption through his blood" (Col. 1: 14), and he "made peace through the blood of his cross" (Col. 1:20).  In Hebrews we are told that "by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us" (Heb. 9: 12). We are told, "without shedding of blood is no remission" (Heb. 9:22). We have "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus" (Heb. 10:19). Jesus suffered with out the camp, "that he might sanctify the people with his own blood" (Heb. 13:12).  John tells us clearly that ''the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin" (I John 1:7) ''Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood'' (Rev. 1:5). They will sing of Christ, ''thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood'' (Rev. 5:9).  Even though MacArthur believes that he has dispensed with Rev. 1:5, as we previously discussed, he still must face Rev. 7:14. I think he shall find little comfort there. "These are they which came out of great tribulation. and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Even the revised texts, and their new version offspring, such as NIV, and the ASV, give MacArthur not one whit of aid and comfort. If the blood itself has no significance, then why do we have all of these Scriptures?  What Christ Said About The Blood  MacArthur's belief cannot be reconciled with the words of my Saviour, when He said, "For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins" (Matt. 26:28). "This cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you" (Luke 22:20). These words were spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ as He instituted the Lord's Supper for His Church. In all honesty, it would seem to me, that MacArthur should eliminate the drink, "the fruit of the vine," from the Lord's Supper. He only needs the unleavened bread. Of course if he were to do so, he would be in direct disobedience to the Word of God.  The children of Israel were told to slay the Passover lamb. They were to take the blood of the lamb, and strike it upon the door posts of their houses. "And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you..." (Ex. 12: 13). God did not tell them to hang the body of the lamb on the door post.  MacArthur's doctrine is in conflict with Lev. 17:11, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul."  It is perfectly clear that MacArthur minimizes the blood of Christ. To me, this is a terrible thing for anyone to do. While he may not go as far as R. B. Thieme, Jr., he certainly is headed in the same direction. Bible believers need to mark such men, and avoid them, according to the Scriptures. The teaching of MacArthur, on this subject, is very dangerous, and he should be exposed.  The clear and direct statements of the above Scriptures prove that John MacArthur is wrong in his teaching about the blood of Christ. He has departed from the general Biblical teaching on this subject. No matter how popular he may be, we must believe the Bible and not MacArthur.  He Is In Conflict With Writers Of The Past  I have examined a number of the writings of other men on Heb. 9:22, and I find that they are not in agreement with John MacArthur. Of this verse, John Gill says, "And without shedding of blood is no remission; that is, of sin; there was no typical remission without it; and there can be no real remission but by the blood of Christ, no instance can be given of pardon without it; if it could be otherwise, the blood of Christ had not been shed..." (Gill's Commentary, Vol. 6, page 734, Baker Book House).  Matthew Poole says, " . . . without the death of some living creature as a sacrifice, and the blood of it not only shed, but sprinkled, there could be neither legal pardon of guilt, nor purging of ceremonial filth. By this God signified to Israel, that without the blood of Christ his Son, and the Testator of his testament, shed as a sacrifice, to purchase and procure both remission and the Spirit, there could be neither pardon of the guilt of sin, and removal of the punishment, nor purging the filth, or renewing the nature of the sinner, his blood being the inestimable price purchasing both for them." (A Commentary on the Holy Bible, by Matthew Poole, Vol. 3, page 851, MacDonald Publishing Company).  E. Schuyler English says of Heb. 9:22, "And now we come to a dogmatic and absolute statement: 'and without shedding of blood is not remission.' All men stand upon one level in respect to the sin question and as to the remission of sins. It cannot be apart from the blood that is shed. This is God's way. This is precious truth. Not one sin can ever be remitted apart from the blood. All generations must look to the blood-the blood of Christ." He further writes, "Sin is a serious matter. It's only antidote is the blood of Christ. . . No, dear friend, we ourselves have no merit, nothing in which we can boast, no hope in the world or in eternity, saving in the precious blood of Christ that was shed for us and pledges to bring us into an eternal inheritance that is incorruptible and cannot fade. 'Without shedding of blood is no remission.' " (Studies In The Epistle To The Hebrews, by E. Schuyler English, pages 270-271, 1955, Southern Bible Book House). While English may be placed in the new evangelical camp, his teaching on the above verse is Biblical.  What Spurgeon Said About The Blood  Charles H. Spurgeon preached a sermon entitled. "The Blood Shedding," February 22, 1857, from Hebrews 9:22. He describes the suffering and death of Christ, and says, "Mark his brow-they have put about it a crown of thorns, and the crimson drops of gore are rushing down his cheeks! . . . But turn aside that purple robe for a moment. His back is bleeding. ..They lift up the thongs, still dripping clots of gore; they scourge and tear his flesh, and make river of blood to run down his shoulders! This is the shedding of blood without which there is no remission...They fling him to the ground; they nail his hands and feet to the transverse wood, they hoist it in the air...Blood from his head, blood from his hands, blood from his feet. . They pierce his side, and forthwith runneth out blood and water. This is the shedding of blood, sinners and saints; this is the awful shedding of blood, the terrible pouring out of blood, without which for you, and for the whole human race, there is no remission...it is not a thing which you may doubt, or which you may believe; it must be believed and received, otherwise you have denied the Scriptures and turned aside from God." He further states, "It cuts off every other hope, bring your hopes here, and if they are not based in blood, and stamped with blood, they are as useless as castles in the air, and dreams of night. 'There is no remission,' says he text, in positive and plain cords. . . Except you put confidence n the shedding of our Saviour's blood, and in the blood shedding alone, for without it there is no remission." (The New Park Street Pulpit, Vol. 3, pages 90-92, Pilgrim Publications).  Spurgeon never changed in his preaching of the blood. On May 30, 1875, he preached again from the same text. In his sermon, he repeated over and over, "Without shedding of blood is no remission." Without resorting to lengthy quotations, we can honestly say that his doctrine never changed. He said, "It is not possible that any sin should ever be forgiven to any man without shedding of blood." (Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit, Vol. 51, page 426, Pilgrim Publications).  Of course nothing is true simply because Spurgeon, Gill, or someone else said it; but it so happens that what they said on the blood is biblical and sound, while what MacArthur has said is false. No one can deny that MacArthur is a gifted and talented speaker. He is the Senior Minister of Grace Cathedral, Panorama City, California, and the popular speaker on the widely distributed radio broadcast entitled, "Grace To You." He has built a tremendously large church, and he has a very large radio audience. This is all the more reason why someone should expose his false teaching on the blood. No doubt we shall lose some friends over this exposure of error, but we hold truth dearer than we do friends. The cause of truth must ever be first. -From Plains Baptist Challenger 8/86  JOHN MACARTHUR AND THE BLOOD OF CHRIST A few months ago a pastor friend and I visited a John MacArthur meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, and I purchased a copy of MacArthur's commentary on Hebrews with the desire to see exactly what he says about the Blood of Jesus Christ. This commentary was published in 1983 by Moody Press. Moody Bible Institute holds the copyright.  There can be no mistake about MacArthur's position that the Blood itself does not save us, that the Blood is SYMBOLIC of death. Words could not be plainer. In a mere three pages of this book MacArthur uses the term "symbolic" no less than thirteen times:  "Blood is a SYMBOL of death, and therefore follows closely the idea of a testator's having to die in order for a will to become effective. ...  "It is possible to become morbid about Christ's sacrificial death and preoccupied with His suffering and shedding of blood. It is especially possible to become unbiblically preoccupied with the physical aspects of His death. It was not Jesus' physical blood that saves us, but His dying on our behalf, which is SYMBOLIZED by the shedding of His physical blood. ...  "The purpose of the blood was to SYMBOLIZE sacrifice for sin, which brought cleansing from sin. Therefore, without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.  "Again, however, we need to keep in mind that the blood was a SYMBOL. If Christ's own physical blood, in itself, does not cleanse from sin, how much less did the physical blood of animals. It is not surprising, then, that the Old Covenant allowed a SYMBOL for a SYMBOL. ... This exception is clear proof that the old cleansing was SYMBOLIC. Just as the animal blood SYMBOLIZED Christ's true atoning blood, so the ephah of flour SYMBOLIZED and represented the animal blood. This non-blood offering for sin was acceptable because the old sacrifice was entirely SYMBOLIC anyway.  "Yet this was the only exception. And even the exception represented a blood sacrifice. The basic SYMBOL could not be changed because what it SYMBOLIZED could not be changed. ... Since the penalty for sin is death, nothing but death, SYMBOLIZED by shedding of blood, can atone for sin. ... the only way we can participate in the New Covenant, is through the atoning DEATH of Jesus Christ, made effective for us when we trust in Him as saving Lord" (John MacArthur, Hebrews, pp. 236- 238).  MacArthur's position on the Blood of Christ is a great heresy. It is precisely the same heresy promoted by the translator of the Today's English Version, who replaced the term "blood" with "death" in most key passages.  Edit 
 Heard a lot about the movie and was looking forward to seeing it. Then I got the dvd...could not play in my dvd player...Not sure why, so I watched it on my computer.  Only to find someone had taken out all the nasty or blurred it out.  I would of liked the movie much better if I could of seen it without the cuts and it would have been nice to see it on my tv.. 
 As the title says the book is rife with Catholic apologetics.  Catholicism is the touchstone used to compare pretty much every belief and "ism" to (i.e. protestantism, arianism, etc...) This review is not to make a case for or against Catholicism, but to demonstrate the ludicrous "scholarship" of this work, as opposed to what one would expect from any work claiming to be a "dictionary."  Instead of spending it's words on the historical aspects/development of a given belief, the entries are dominated by apologias for, or against, said belief from the Catholic point of view.  This behavior is exemplified in the treatment of the Trinity doctrine entry, and oddly, a venomous attack on Jehovah's Witnesses  (while giving fair accounts to pretty much every modern religious movement that Catholicism generally deems: "heretical.").  The Trinity:  More than half of the entry is dedicated to exegesis of New Testament passages according to modern Trinitarian thought following the claim that (pg. 1394): "Though the word 'Trinity'.. is not found in Scripture, the conception is there both implicitly and explicitly."  Also, the very first sentence of the entry calls the Trinity doctrine: "The central dogma of Christian theology", however, in providing an argument, instead of historical facts, the work relegates itself to the category of apologetics, not scholarship.  As an argument, it naturally downplays the significance of the opposing viewpoints, in this case: the "heresy" of Subordinationism (a topic that doesn't even receive it's own entry in this "dictionary"!), its proponents, Gnosticism, and the prevalent Arianism.  The author violates the context of the historical development of what it calls "the central dogma of Christian theology" by glossing over centuries of the doctrines' development;  even going so far as to label some of the defenders and propagators (pre-Nicea) of early Trinitarian thought: "unorthodox" (despite the fact that "orthodoxy" hadn't been established yet). (pg. 1394 - "Where the doctrine was elaborated, as e.g. in the writings of the Apologists, the language remained on the whole indefinite, and from a later standpoint, was even partly unorthodox.  Sometimes it was not free from a certain subordinationism..")    On Christian Science (pg. 279): "Its teaching on the unreality of matter, sin, and suffering conflicts with the Biblical doctrines of the Creation, Fall, and Redemption."  The author fails to note that this is opinion (regardless if accurate or not).  Jehovah's Witnesses (pg. 729): "This Adventist teaching was developed by his successor, J.F. Rutherford on lines professedly subversive of civil authority...  They can hardly be regarded as a religious society..", "Jehovah's Witnesses is an organization with printing establishments all over the world.  They carry on an effective propaganda among an uncritical public and attract esp. the dissatisfied elements of society by preaching hatred of all existing institutions."  Of the founder, Charles Taze Russel, the author again levels the charge of subversive teachings, and again makes the implication that Witnesses are civically disloyal anarchists (pg. 1210): "His teaching... lends itself to political propaganda of a subversive type...  His ideas were developed in a still more anarchist direction by J.F. Rutherford."    Again, regardless if you hold the assertions made to be true, or not, the conclusion is unequivocally clear.  I don't recommend spending more than 5$ on this book (including shipping).  I gave it 1 star (because I can't give it zero), despite it's thoroughly un-scholastic nature, it is a good resource to have handy if you want to quickly know the dates of certain events  (or if you need to prop up a table leg, or if you need a highly absorbent coaster).  DO NOT expect nuanced, objective, comprehensive entries on any subject in this work (i.e. a DICTIONARY!).  EXPECT argumentative, judgmental prose, and a total lack of objectivity. 
 I read someone's comments that "it's the world's worst phone" and I thought, "Nah, that can't be." Alas, it is. Where do I begin?   Let's start with the fact that there's no caller ID on the base - so when the kids have left the phone in another room, my wife or I cannot see who's calling... until we find the phone!  There's no blinking light to indicate that someone has left a message. If you step outside for a few minutes, you have to remember to pick up the phone when you get back inside, just to hear if someone called.   I was amused to see that when you silence the ringer - like when you're in the bedroom at night and your wife is sleeping - it cheerfully acknowledges your muting of it with a LOUD beep, thereby waking up your loved one. Who says phone design people have no sense of humor?  Most serious, though, is the once-a-week flaking out, where all the handsets suddenly display "Searching" (including the one that's sitting right in the base) and we cannot make calls. It took me awhile to figure out that we have to unplug the base from the A/C outlet for about 3 minutes. Then we can make calls again.  I notice that someone else mentioned the small size and that "it takes some getting used to". Well, we never did - not even my daughters. For them, trying to go over homework on the phone with a friend, they cannot hold the little handset with their shoulders and go "hands-free" (and I sure can't, either).  It's mind-boggling how the company tossed away so many good features of the previous line. That previous model is now discontinued, according to Motorola themsselves. In fact, they were the ones who talked me into "upgrading". (Never has a word been so misused). So, this was our second, and last, Motorola  - though they do make nice cell phones!  I now have the latest Uniden cordless on order (the Consumer magazines say it's quite good) and will let y'all know about that one. Fingers crossed.. 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 I mean this is like "Plan 9" stupid! I'm baffled to see so many people on here liked it. I thought it looked real good from the previews but luckily I didn't see it in the theater, I rented it. And seriously I almost turned it off a couple of times but then it got to point where I just had to see how stupid it could actually get and let me tell you; the acid trip scene in the desert with the vision of Tom Waits takes the cake! I would have laughed out loud if I wasn't so jaw droppingly stunned by it. Another "great" scene is when Domino gets a house full of Mexicans with drawn guns to undraw them by giving one of them a lap dance. Hillarious! Especially since they show a picture of the real Domino at the end of the movie. Keira Knightley she was not! I don't know what third world country this woman gave up a career in modeling to become a bounty hunter in but I can't imagine this woman was ever sexy. Even in her early twenties.  To me this movie is more of a joke than anything else. The acting is NOT good, the directing is NOT good, the cinamatography is NOT good, Knightley was horribly cast as Domino. The whole movie is laughable. Top 5 worst movies of all time.  
 After watching this extremely low-budget film of a tale based on the historical story of "Hamlet" it was easy to see where all the money went: to the cast members.  The cast is loaded with potential.  It includes Gabriel Byrne, Helen Mirren, Christian Bale, a youthful looking Kate Beckinsale (she has come a long, long way since this film), and a plethora of the kind of actors that make you ask, "What other movie did I see that actor in?"  But the rest of the film fails to live up to this monumental promise.  For much of the movie it looks and feels like a made-for-television romp through medieval times.  It has a small cast of haggard-looking extras in peasant clothing, royalty that, if not for the crowns they wore, would be indistinguishable from the common herd, and some very predictable and flawed direction. The followers of the king, peasantry included, number about thirty in total and they all live in this small wooden village.  The director makes the mistake of using a large amount of voice-over narration to propel the story, which by the end was whittled down to about 90 minutes of Masterpiece Theater shot in the countryside.  One scene has Hamlet dashing from a buring hall, sword in hand, but when he rounds the corner of a building his sword is missing; cut to the following scene of Hamlet confronting the new king, his murderous uncle, and the sword reappears in his hand.  That kind of blatantly poor film editing is unforgivable.  The acting ranges from good to passable, but no amount of thespian zeal could have or did save this project from gradual diminishing returns.  Except for the sighting of a schoolgirl version of Kate Beckinsale, prim and proper as all young lasses tend to be, this film is sadly a waste of time and money.    
 Ah, true Love.  Dinner by candlelight.  Holding hands in the moonlight.  Snapping a new clip on your Glock while your significant other sprays you with semi-automatic love missiles.  I appreciate a dark comedy as much as the next curmudgeon, yet MR. & MRS. SMITH annoys more than it entertains.  True, there is a predictable plot about a beautiful couple stuck in a rut--a couple who, unbeknownst to one another, are professional assassins (just try to stop that suspension of disbelief train).  Add to that the erotic chemistry between Brad and Angelina; my eyebrows are still singed after watching them.  But all the sexiness and over-the-top, lamebrained action fail to overcome the annoyance of Pitt's detached smirk and Jolie's constant flirtation with wackiness.  As the fighting (boy, is there fighting) escalates, I was suddenly asking myself, "Wouldn't it be great if they popped each other off?"  Maybe in the sequel.  While we're at it, would someone please feed Angelina a steak, mashed potatos. . .something?  Nothing wrong with being slim 'n trim, but come on, lose the East Africa look.  In the long run, MR. & MRS. SMITH's biggest problem was the fact Vince Vaughn didn't appear enough.  At least he gets paid to be annoying. --D. Mikel 
 I'll condense this entire book into one sentence for you: follow your dreams, do what you love in life, and don't let other people define your idea of happiness and success. Thanks. Nice message, but I could have gotten that advice from Brodow's "bubbe" over a nice bowl of chicken soup or from any cracker-barrel philosopher worth his salt. This was a useless book, with a limited message stretched over a grueling 259 pages, printed solely to cash in on the lucrative self-help market.   
 I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.  I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
 This product is worthless. Save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else.   I've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank. I'm really surprised that Amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in 
 Yes hated.  I'm at a disavantage having not read the book, but I have to say this movie was not what I expected at all.  I have never felt prompted to write a bad review EVER until now (sorry Sean Bean - whose work I usually love). I hate I bought the DVD instead of renting it first.   *The below review is my opinion and contains spoiler info*   I'm not the kind of movie watcher who has to have a happy ending because I understand it doesn't always happen in real life, so it doesn't have to happen for me in a movie. In addition to that, I also love a great character study even if some of the characters are of ill-repute. However, this movie was long, drawn out and ALL of the characters REALLY got on my nerves.  I found myself not caring for, wanting to understand or LIKING any of them early on.  I have no problem watching movies where in order for the story to unfold, the viewer must get a little dirty as he/she follows the characters.  I found the characters exhausting in just TRYING to find any reason to care what each one did or didn't do next.  The end result was disturbing in which you wanted to watch Brady Bunch afterwards just to get rid of the dark filthy oppressive feeling you had afterwards. Neither character was believable in their diligence to maintain or obtain what each lived for. Neither character was someone I could sympathize with (which is saying a lot since one of them was held down by a group while being raped! All for love?) I don't see how this movie can benefit anyone on any level.  Again, I can only write an opinion based on this movie version, as I have not read the book.  For all I know, the book may incite compassion and sympathy from it's reader towards one or all of the characters whether they are the victim or the victimizer. This movie does not. It makes you angry that you were ever introduced to either character, angry that it was ever put on film and angry that you wasted any of your time watching it. 
 This is one of those books that appeal to the pretentious.  The author is self-conscious and clever and has obviously written it with literary critics and English teachers and the sort of pseudo-intellectual that hangs out in New York cafes in mind.  The actual story was the last thing on his mind and it shows--the whole thing is a pastiche with what plot there is used to parade his annoying characters (Camus or Satre heroes in Victorian dress) and to make annoying observations (all the last word in philosophy circa 1960 but really dull in 2006).  Nothing could be more contrived than the alternate endings that one must pick from.  The reader does not want to pick an ending, to be truthful, because the author has not made the reader CARE.  I think I will continue reading actual Victorian novels, by the likes of Dickens, Trollope and Eliot rather than ever bothering to re-read this nonsense 
 My son, husband, and I really do not like this DVD because (unlike other Baby Einstein DVDs) this DVD is too focused on cheap looking computer animation. There are very few puppet scenes, and the ones they have are pretty quick and lack much depth. The music is pretty bad, too. I prefer the music of Baby Mozart or Baby Beethoven. This sounded synthetic and computer-generated, not "real." I found this DVD to be boring and couldn't keep my attention or that of my son. My son (15 months) can't watch this entire DVD. He gets very bored and sick of the monotonous sign language instructions  (which take up most of the DVD and are pretty fast in pace).  I was underwhelmed and wish I hadn't purchased this DVD. It is not like previous BE DVDs.  I suggest Baby McDonald, Baby Da Vinci, or Baby Mozart to those who wish to purchase a BE DVD.  
 This book was too predicatable, I could see the plot coming miles ahead. A big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops, and he doesn't even have a gun, all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain. You knew Goldie would turn out to be a hooker, and if that's a spoiler for you. You need to read more fiction and/or watch more sopa operas. The characters aren't that complex, rather two-dimensional and to make matters worse, Miller doesn't even give a twist in the plot. For the record, there have been a number of people who claim to work for God that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes. The Crusades for one. So, Miller you don't get any points from me on that one. Now for those of you that are saying. "Hey it's only a comic book, a big one but a comic nonetheless." I say, "That is BULLL!!" Read: watchmen, The Judas Contract, Future Imperfect, and The League part one and two. Oh and Elfquest and then tell me if a comic book can't be well, this no story piece of crap 
 [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/Genesis.asp] [www.answersingenesis.org] has numerous refutations of 'progressive creationism' and specifically of Ross' assertation of the meaning of the Hebrew word for day (yom). They clearly demonstrate the grammatical errors of his claim.  Also see the book "Refuting Compromise" by Jonathan Sarfati, Ph.D 
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 I used to like these guys, but the more songs I hear by Minor Threat and TSOL, the more I realize how the Offspring were just copycats.  What a discrace to punk.  I wish bands like the Offspring, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink 182, Simple Plan, and New F@g glory would just (...) off!  The only "American Idiots" are the ones that buy into this boy band poser punk.  "WE'RE JUST A MINOR THREAT! 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 The author had unlimited access but tells a very unbalanced story.  My main issue is (like Thucydides20) that the academics are totally ignored.  That is such a huge part of life at the Point, as various grads have told me.  Also, the regular Honor Code scandals is another point ignored in the book.  The book talks about the Honor Code with a "see no evil" mentality.  Yet every 10-15, regular as clockwork, there is a cheating scandal related to that code.  While we are at it, there is very little written about the teachers.  It is a shame Lipsky chose not to spend any time with them.  I also had major problems with the format of the book, it jumps around way too much.  Just when you are starting to get a feel for a cadet, you are jerked away from that person.  I have spent a lot of time at the Point and have great affection for the institution and its people.  It is a shame that given unlimited access, Lipsky did such a poor job 
 What does it mean when someone gets excessively-defensive? It doesn't express that they have peace or comfort with themselves.  Writing sludge like this just fuels the fire - that I suppose they are trying to put out. If .. there .. WAS .. ever .. a .. fire. 
 I had read a lot of John Irving when I was younger and was excited to read a new book of his. But this very long book is way below his usual standard. The characters are unlikable and not believable and it just goes on and on. If you want to read John Irving try his earlier work 
 I will start off by saying i am ashamed to live in a dorm room with someone who owns Vertical Limit. On that note I could go on and on using vulgarities to belittle the movie. Instead I will do my best to explain to you what it is like to view Vertical Limit. Simply put it is like having three masked men jump you in the street, put you in a burlap bag and beat you with an iron baseball bat, again and again. And again. This movie is a slap in the face to rock climbers everywhere 
 I wouldn't say this is cheap in price considering the quality. It should  have been $1.99. Severe ghosting on a Gateway VX1120 through a LinkSys  PS2KVM4 switch running two DELLS, and two GATEWAYS with two machines  running SUSE LINUX. Horrible reception for every single machine. What a  waste of money 
 Since the credits indicate the screenplay was written by Delpy and Hawke along with Linklater, maybe it's too much to expect that self-absorbed actors would be able to accurately write about real and interesting people. While Delpy's Celine does have a few sparks of genuine insight (e.g. learning who you really are when you're not distracted by TV, shopping, etc.), Hawke's Jesse relies too much on cliches (e.g. marriage because of pregnancy eventually becomes bad marriage with little/no sex, etc.).   Delpy at least appeared to try to play a flawed but genuine Celine whereas Hawke's Jesse was just too cool. He looked like he had ADHD and could barely wait for her to finish her lines, so he could throw out his single entendres. I agree with the other reviewer who thought the movie felt like a painfully long and awkward date.  What's so irritating about movies like this is how they try to make "real life" seem so meaningless while idealizing some unattainable fantasy--like somehow it's more romantic to experience a few hours of happiness with a complete stranger every 15-20 years while you marry and spend your life with someone you don't really love. UGGHHH!!!   If you want to watch a movie about dysfunctional people, then rent/buy Mike Nichol's "Closer" where flawed but interesting characters are portrayed with sometimes painful realism. Closer doesn't try to romanticize the "love of your life" but rather show that what people expect from love may differ. Maybe Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have never experienced real love, which is why they can't really write about it.  
 This could have been an excellent study into the characteristics of manhood set by culture, society, environment, and nature. Instead it is a terribly limited view of a handful of men in one country. Sadly, it is void of enthusiasm for its topic, boring as dirt, and less interesting than reading a phone book.The author seems more intent on proving he has read a great deal on the topic by endlessly paraphrasing the work of other studies (always giving due credit), but displays little skill in using his knowledge to make his viewpoints or research remotely appealing 
 The author has a decent touch with action sequences (few though they are in this book). And he seems to have a real affinity for martial arts which comes across in his writing and enriches his story. But he is very akward at moving the plot forward and constantly depends on groups of characters sitting around dicussion what happened. "Why did this clue appear earlier? What is the significance of this event? What trends should we see based on events so far." Very clumsy style which veers into Hardy Boys book territory. But when he finishes explaining everything that's happended so far he writes competently. If you got the book free and like the genre it's worth reading on a plane 
 Berkhof's Systmatic is of course a classic text that is a gem.  I had the old Banner Of Truth edition for years but like a dope sold it for pennies on the dollar.  This edition from Eerdmans is truly abominable.    Where do I start?  First off, the font size is terrible.  So if you are over 58 the eye strain is quite significant.  Then comes the print type.  It is almost as if someone churned out copies in his garage.  The printing is extremely bad.  Sentences contain words that after a letter or two turn light and then dark and in a few instances downright smudgy.  Was the typeset dirty?  Did you run out of ink?  True, this edition contains Berkhof's introductory section which is a bonus.  But what good is it if the production quality is abysmal?  How unfortunate that such a magnificient work is so insulted.   Mr. Publisher, check out Shedd's Dogmatic Theology by P and R Publishers.  That is how one presents a text of significance.    If you have the Banner Of Truth edition do not trade it in lest you rue the day.     
 The concept of this book intrigued me: analysis of the first really postmodern president America had, a man who was known for scanning the polls before he had an opinion on any issue, and a candidate whose success was made possible by computer analysis of voter opinion. However, the work itself is quite tedious. There is not enough analysis of characters, and too many scenes explaining the political process. There is too much emphasis on the development of a plot that's tangential to the study of tehse characters, and there is not enough room given to them so that, in breathing, they might exhale what we can then diagnose. I didn't understand why so much emphasis was placed on the narrator, either, since his role was not central. While I read this book without political bias, I was not blown away by its quality as a read or a political novel, but the insight into a certain president's character, and how that made him a success, was intriguing. Not sure if I'd recommend it to anyone except historians at this point 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 I requested this cart for my 2 yr. old last Christmas - it's cute and "goes with" her dolly, but I really wish I'd asked for a more sturdy cart. She likes that the basket separates, but the handle is so flush with the basket, she can only put smaller things in it. I thought it'd be fun that the basket and seat detach, but they are difficult for a child to put back on and she has to ask me to do it. Plus, both of her dollies' legs get caught in the seat so she can't get them out either. Most of the food things are cardboard, which I yes, laminated with packaging tape, and they still did not hold up. The banana, milk and dish are cute, but I don't think they warrent choosing this cart 
 Like much of the rest of the Power Japanese series, this book does a good job of introducing vocabulary that you may not find in other sources. However the vocabulary is so high level that beginning and intermediate learners will have a hard time memorizing it and using it in conversations. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the book covers such a wide variety of specialized fields that the terms may be inadequate for an advanced learner. Advanced learners may be better served by reading books written for Japanese people about a particular subject. If you find books written for adults too difficult, books written for children and teens may be helpful. Beginning and intermediate learners might impress some people by reading sentences out of this book, but you'll probably never use a lot of this vocabulary, and hence will probably forget it. There are better books to spend your money on 
 What they said was that Katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme.  I saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst performer of the night.  The first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say.  Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was "Snowflake."  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.  Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for her to put on record 
 I was so excited when I bought this book.  Dispair set in once I disovered the focus was on stay at home moms of very young children.  I couldn't get past all of the examples of the trails and tribulatiions of "new moms" to focus on the 24/7 balancing act of working moms 
 after just 7 months. So be aware that you might buy into some hassle by exchanging the knifes with Henckels. I am very dissappointed and will not spend that much money ($80) on knifes ever again, at least not on Henckels. My K-mart knifes hold up better 
 Senator Obama'a latest screed is a book about politics, common gound and reclaiming the American Dream. People looking for some deep thought that transcends our political, social, and foriegn policy issues are bound to be disapointed, especially if you are a progressive who swooned over his Speech at the Democratic Convention 2 years ago. The book breaks down into his childhood in Hawaii youthful indiscertions (a little coke, herb etc..) and the transition into the man he is today. Obama's centrism is really oft- putting to someone like me who feels that partisonship is a good idea (At least your enemies know where you stand)he would rather work the middle ground and find soloutions to our problems that are at it's heart does not lend itself to a 'gray area'.   The chapter I found on race is  typical Clinton doublespeak, As an Afro- American His appeal to 'universality' is trite at best because in one minute he knows he does not live an "authentic" cultural black expericence  Obama who is mixed is doing what Shelby Steele calls  " racial negotitating " making whites feel comfortable around someone like Obama who trusts that white america will do the right thing and he believes in the moral goodness of the majority white population and this country's ethos thereby he is liked for not challenging their morality. Obama tries to have it both ways empathizing with  the Afro- American and Hispanic  struggle (the vote he really needs to win election if he chooses to run for the Presidency)and he unlike many black intellectuals knows that the conservative movement used the symbols of the great society progress to butress their arguments in a "racial cold war". Obama fails when he lectures Latinos on Immirgration and by trying to find common ground he ends up alienating those who challenge this society's attitude about both blacks and Latinos.I think he is naive about race in this country, I for one do not trust the majority society to treat us with brotherhood and charity (after 389 years Afro- Americans ought to know better)I look at people as Enemies or Allies and white conservatives are the enemy of Afro- Americans or do we have to go to New Orleans for the Genocide (I see dead black people floating) they attempted last year.If Obama wants to negoitate with conservatives and find common ground that's his right, I would rather have power because it is the only thing White conservatives (and their minority allies) understand.  The last chapter he talks of his wife and her family that is the most touching thing in the whole book, his love for her seems genuine and you can tell he has empathy and concern for her and children in general. I feel that his book is just  and average at best. Maybe he might be President but he will not be the 'first black president'. But if you are a believer in Obama's charisma and think he can rise above petty politics and bring people of different races into a common American ideal then this book is for you, But if you do not like " Colorblind Centrists" like Obama and Harold Ford think they are weak 'Uncle Toms" then this book will to you be just average 
 I found this book to be too much of a "cookbook". Information is good, but not enough at all. The section about the divisionals is bad..why tell you how to construct a navamsa or hora chart if she doesn't tell you  how to use it during interpretation? It's an okay introductory text..but I  strictly mean "just okay". Light on Life by Hart DeFouw is *MUCH*  better, although you must be more of an intellectual to grasp the  information. Dreyers book was written for attention spanned challenged  Americans, I think. It was one of the first jyotish books I bought, but I  don't refer back to it when I have a question. I couldn't recommend this  book 
 I liked Terry McMillan's "The Interruption of Everything", so I was really looking forward to reading this book- but it was one of the worst, most frustrating books I've ever read. First of all, the writing is on about a sixth-grade level. Example: "...Charles asked me if I wanted to dance. I said yes. So we danced. He danced like a man who was sure of himself. He watched me. I watched him. He smiled at me. I smiled at him." That's when I rolled my eyes and gave up. Unfortunately it was on page 365!! From then on I scanned the rest of the pages, just to satisfy my curiosity about what would happen to the rest of these characters. Secondly, most of the characters are complete morons, except for Gloria, who seemed real to me. (Working mom, single, trying to do the best for her son...) The other three jump into bed with EVERY man they meet, usually within the first three hours of meeting him. Then they whine and moan about how there are no good men out there. Well, DUH!!! Perhaps this is the point of the book, self-fufilling prophecy. I do like the title. It describes that feeling of waiting while what you want (husband, job, baby, etc.) hasn't happened yet. But this book was a disappointing waste of time. 
 As Abraham Rabinovich, author of The Yom Kippur War: The Epic Encounter That Transformed the Middle East, said: It is easy to be annoyed at this flawed attempt at a comprehensive account of the Six-Day war. But the book does carry the reader along and can serve as an introduction for those unfamiliar with that landmark event and, also, as a reminder for those who have forgotten.  The absence of a preface in which Bowen, a BBC journalist, should have spelled out what he was attempting to achieve and how he intended to go about it is an immediate warning of a lack of weightiness. Another sign is the absence of maps, except for two unhelpful regional maps.  To his credit, Bowen appears to have read dozens of the books written on the war, including the most recent, as well as relevant government archives, particularly of the United States and United Kingdom. He has also interviewed military and civilian personnel on both sides although he does not indicate how many. But his account remains that of a journalist making notes from the sidelines, not of a researcher who has immersed himself in the heart of the matter, who can make informed assessments, and has original insights to offer. He misses central elements in the story, such as the fascinating objections in the Israeli cabinet to the capture of Jerusalem's Old City-and the Western Wall-by ministers from the National Religious Party, who maintained that it was too politically and ideologically hot to handle; this from a party that would soon after spearhead Israeli settlement efforts.  The battle descriptions are incomprehensible, and Bowen, in searching for the illuminating detail or pregnant quote, more often ends up with banality and schmaltz. Nevertheless, there are interesting glimpses of the players, particularly in the Egyptian camp. Bowen's description of how Egypt and the Arab world worked their way up with ever expanding rhetoric into war fever despite their near-total lack of preparation remains, even four decades later, an astonishment.  Abraham Rabinovich author of The Yom Kippur War:  The Epic Encounter That Transformed the Middle East 
 This is a horrible movie with no redeeming value. I realize that such a knock will actually drive people to purchase this. Let me bring something to you attention.  This is a slasher movie with effective gore. In fact, for the time, the gore was more sick that similar movies. However, there are no scares, no suspense, no clever script, no story and it has a stupic ending. I know, that applies to most gore movies!  The problem with this movie is that it is overly mean spirited towards women (I am a man, a 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy that also raises a family).  The story, which has a guy killing women b/c of mistreatment from his mother, seems like it was written and directed by a person that shares the same demons as the killer of the film.    The murders in this movie are so mean-spirited (yet with no cinematic value) that a normal movie goer would have to be offended. This movie is not sick in a "good" movie way but rather sick in an ashamed manner.   This is a woman-bashing movie that should make any viewer feel guilty that they are patronizing this garbage. A movie should have an entertainment value. There is no cinematic, artistic touch on this film.  This is simply a mean, mean movie!    
 Rand is ever the hyper-rationalist, believing that all problems can be solved by using humankind's unique endowment of "reason." After all, didn't Boethius claim mankind is the superior species, because "man is a rational animal?" Rand certainly agrees with Boethius' apotheosis of reason.  But, what KIND of reason? There are at least TWO types of reason: (1) hyper-reason based on a priori, deductive, syllogistic logic, and (2) ordinary reason, based on a posteriori, experiential, inferential logic. (There is a third kind of reason, called mathematical propositional calculus, that is a blend of the two, while heavily favoring the latter.)   Rand is certainly in the first camp, and that's her problem. Almost anything can be deduced syllogistically as Aristotle and Aquinas amply demonstrate. Pick up either author's tomes on how the world "is," and you'll quickly find out they were consistently wrong. They both started from one or more false premises, that lead to false conclusions. More importantly, people, no matter how "rational" they may appear, do not used deductive, a priori logic as consistently as Rand would suggest, much less like. It's not in our nature. The very few that do are "hyper-rationalists," and they are more annoying than satisfying.  Most people, if they use logic at all, use the SECOND kind, and this is the kind that is based on experience, on inferences drawn from direct experience with the senses. It is the development of this kind of reason that has led to the most ambitious outcomes in the history of mankind. But this reason admits up front that nothing is certain, all knowledge and morals are contingent, and that there are no eternal truths. This is the logic Rand deplores. Not because it isn't the most appropriate, but because everything is contingent -- there are no "objective" or "absolute" conclusions. Rand cannot assert her dogmas under this kind of logic. Only "hyper-rationality" of the FIRST kind will allow her to do that!  Most philosophers and scientists have minimized or abandoned the first kind of logic for all the myths, false dogmas, and irrational conclusions that ensue from it. Read Aristotle or Aquinas to see just how wrong they are on practically everything, yet these are the two best paradigms of the first kind of reason. Rand is one of the last holdouts for this kind of irrational logic. That is why the "objectivist" project is doomed from the start; it merely changes the "old" dogmas for "new" ones, "old" myths for "new" ones. That is why here project is doomed from the start, and why reading her "new" claptrap is no better than reading the "old" ones. No serious student of philosophy or science uses "her" kind of logic anymore, and nor should we 
 It's beyond my comprehension how this book made #2 on the NYT list of the best novels of the last 25 years.  While it's well-written (in a structural, grammatical sense), it's devoid of any semblance of a plot or story line.  There were so many extraneous, disconnected sections that it made me wonder whether Mr. Delillo was somehow able to publish this book without the scrutiny of an editor.  My only satisfaction was in persevering to the end of this ponderous tome 
 I liked the second more but the first one sets up the background for the battle between good and evil.  The battle is in each of us as well as us against them.  I like the concept alot 
 In a visual perspective, it's provocative, shocking, and highly disturbing to the point of it being too overwhelming for words...but overall, the movie creeped me out 
 To celebrate the anniversary of our company, we thought we'd give all employees a gift.  Our Apple phobic IT guys nixed the Ipod as a choice, despite the CEO and CTO both owning and recommending them, so we went with the Zune.  Of the 50 we bought, 16 had to be exchanged for quality issues.  We've had issues with the drivers on the Vista enabled computers and spotty syncing with the XP machines.  Several of the units have had poor performing batteries and several also had a buzz in the headphones. We can't use them as data drives so they're not as useful as we'd like.  Finally, store interoperability is zero and we cannot understand why DRM is applied to files if you share them.  Which reminds me, the wireless is half baked; too slow and we've had plenty of hang ups while trying to share. The end of the story is that the CEO is both pissed and embarrassed as to the gift debacle.  He has already said in no uncertain terms that when Apple ships a video ipod, the company will give those to make up for the Zune experience 
 It is amazing that Armenians can rewrite history based on forged documents and lies. Armenians were some of the richest Ottoman citizens that held high positions in the government. They believed the lies of colonial European powers, such as Russia, Britain, France, with the promise of an independent state, and attacked the Ottoman Army from the rear. Armed with the weapons given to them by the Allies, they massacered hundreds of thousands of unarmed innocent Turkish civilians. While the Turkish men were at war fighting at many theathers of war, the Armenian men stayed home, because they were exempt from military service. "They raped any Turkish women they found. They extracted the babies from expecting Turkish mothers with their bayonets. They stuffed the innocent Turkish elderly men, women, and children,into their mosques and burnt them alive. Even Russian generals at the scene, who witnessed these heinous acts, called them the most barbarous race they had ever seen". The Ottoman government re-located them out of the war zone, in self defence. Any other country would have punished them much more severely for these treasonous and barberous acts. Calling this relocation a genocide is disingenous, at the very least. The rewiver is saddened by loss of life suffered by the Armenians during the re-location process. Most of the deaths were caused by attacking Kurdish and Circussian bandits for revenge and booty. The number of Armenian deaths have been greatly exaggerated. The Ottoman Government was unable to protect them any better, because the country was in turmoil, at the time, due to the great war 
 Reading about de Bono's Six Thinking Hats was a difficult way to learn the material.  There are lots of examples but taking a class on the subject is the way to get a real idea of how to use this process.  
       This encyclopedia is for true believers in the Post Keynesian tradition of Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle and Paul Davidson.Unfortunately, this approach to economics can't operationalize any of the analytic tools and concepts Keynes developed in  the A Treatise on Probability in 1921(TP)or in the General Theory in 1936(GT).An obvious place to start is the failure of Post Keynesians to operationalize Keynes's concepts of the weight of the evidence in the TP,uncertainty in the GT and probability in both the TP and GT.Keynesian probability is fundamentally of an interval nature.It is quantitative and at the same time noncomparative,nonrankable,and incommensurable if any of the interval estimates overlap.The source of this analysis is chapters 15,17,20,and 22 of the TP.Weight of the evidence,w,is an index that measures the completeness of the relevant,potential,available evidence upon which probability estimates will be based.Keynes defined it as 0<=w<=1.If w=0,then you are dealing with what Keynes called ignorance in the TP.A w=0 would also hold in the 1937 Quarterly Journal of Economics article if"We simply do not know!"Other names would be complete or total uncertainty or the fundamental uncertainty of the Shackles and the Davidsons.w's between 0 and 1 represent cases of partial knowledge and partial ignorance.Here a set of different probability distributions or a set of intervals would have to be constructed.A w=1 allows a decision maker to specify a single unique probability distribution or interval.Given a strict application of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers,suppose that the data passed the Lexis Q-test for stability.Keynes would then agree that one could apply a normal probability distribution since an analysis of the data would support such a conclusion as long as the data was homogeneous in its composition throughout the series or sequence.Now let us turn to the GT.Keynes was quite clear that uncertainty is a function of the weight of the evidence.As the weight of the evidence increases,uncertainty decreases.As the weight of the evidence decreases,uncertainty increases.u=f(w).If w=0,then uncertainty is total and no estimates of probability are possible.In this case,the decision maker would exhibit a very high liquidity preference and tend to rely on heuristics,rules of thumb,habits,memory,conventions or a follow the crowd approach 
 This was and is a great,great, movie the way it was "originally" conceived! Then, DVDs came along with better visuals and the "required 5.1 soundtrack." Because of it's popularity, Lucas had to "improve" the already wonderful soundtrack inorder to "repackage" his wonderful creation. Well, you guessed it, he, or his audio engineers, ruined the sound by "updating" it. Yes, the visuals are improved but the "new and improved audio track" is barely acceptable which is a shame as there is so much wonderful music in this film. ("He must have changed the editing monitor speakers he used originally to a "better and improved version." The "new" sound track is simply too "accurate" and "uninvolving" on a modern sound system and does not capture the emotions of the original event as well as what you can hear on the "old" VHS and LaserDisc versions. Sad, as the "new" soundtrack, while sounding ok , can distract on a quality home audio/video system these days. Stay with the VHS or LaserDisc versions if your lucky enough to have them. 
 This movie added a world war, changed the continent the story took place on, and then brought the dead back to life. To me, once the essential elements of the author's story are that fundamentally altered, it's not fair to use the title anymore. I realize a number of the changes are a 'tribute' to the Shirley Temple version, but I'd hoped that since the new version wasn't a star vehicle they might have returned to more of the original storyline, but no. At least the first movie was on the correct continent! I like the movie, believe it or not, but it's not the story I read until the first book fell apart, and the changes to the story I listed weren't necessary, and it may have been nice to see that things can work out even when a parent stays dead 
 If you're expecting the same power and intensity of "Scooby Doo On Zombie Island" or "Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost," then you are setting yourself up for a disappointment. It is possible that certain powers felt that the first 2 Scooby movies were too much for children, but with this 3rd movie come a loss of impact, suspense, character development, and even mystery. It may be true that even a medocre Scooby movie is better than no Scooby movie at all, but this movie is almost boring after "Zombie Island" or "Witch's Ghost." Well, Scooby and the gang have car trouble in a desert. Fred, Daphne, and Velmah go on foot for help while Scooby and Shaggy spot what may be an alien invasion. With their famous and hilarious cowardly ways, they run and eventually meet the rest of the gang at a restaurant. At the restaurant, the gang is surprised that the other patrons don't seem so surprised about the presence of aliens. We also meet Lester who appears eccentric but still aware of what has been going on in the area. Lester lets the gang stay the night, and Scooby and Shaggy have their first encounter with the possible 'aliens.' Moving on, Scooby and Shaggy meet Amber and Crystal, and are attracted to them. They later meet the mechanic Buck as well as a team of scientists (that we already have met). Unlike "Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost," the misleads are not really well drawn. Also, rather than being surprised by the discovery of the villains, we are likely to be somewhat disappointed that it was so obvious. Even when we are presented with the most unusual character in this story (in this case it seems pointless to try to hide anything) it's nothing most people couldn't have figured out. I won't deny that there are some good moments in this movie. (For undoubtedly the first time, Scooby and Shaggy go to a restaurant and want nothing!)  But even the old episodes were usually better than this movie. Parents may not have to screen this movie, but it is  likely that even children will fall asleep during this one. Thank goodness for the eventual "Legend of the Vampire" and "Aloha Scooby Doo." 
 This movie did not have much of a plot.  I know it was made to be a musical, but most musicals have more of a plot than this one.  I enjoyed watching Walter Brennan and Buddy Ebsen, two classic actors 
 The special effects are quite good. The plot, pacing, acting, internal consistency, and internal logic, much less so.  Even fantasy must have some internal logic to maintain willing suspension of disbelief. It needs some tension, some drama, and some surprises. Dinotopia lacks much of this.  Most of the plot twists are foreshadowed well in advance. The major suprises mostly come from hopelessly illogical acts by the major characters. (An example, someone tries to kill a character, in Waterfall City. The victim survives and is rescued. Not only does it never seem that any charges are brought against the villain, he reappears later and is accepted warrily by our heros.) The plotting is obvious, when it is hoplessly muddled. There is foreshadowing about a major secret of the dinosaurs, a missing commandment on the obilisk of "rules". When revealed the secret is an anti-climax. The motives of the carivore villains are unexplored -- are they as intelligent as the herbavores? Why are they guarding the entrances to the underground ruins -- tradition? Even the "suprise" appearance of one character is too well foreshadowed to be a surprise. More of a "huh", thought so.  No explanation is given for the one bit of driving tension, why the mysterious sunstones are wearing out, and why anyone would expect those underground not to be failing at the same rate.  No explanation is even remotely tendered for how a 200 mile wide island of such diverse terrain could possibly be hidden in the Atlantic. (Given the wreckage and the islanders' knowledge of a war with Germany, the Atlantic makes more sense than the Pacific.) Even a nod towards time travel, dimentional portals, etc. would have been handy.  All in all -- the pretty pictures aren't worth 4 hours of your time 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 I really didn't like this book to say the least.  I didn't like the way it was written.  I didn't like the story line at all.  None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines.  I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1.  I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.  Just bad.  It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one 
 I was very, very disappointed when the version I received did not have the entire Jon Bon Jovi sound track. That's what I wanted the DVD for as I already have 2 VHS tapes without it. Can someone tell me where I can get the Young Guns II theatrical version that has the entire Bon Jovi soundtrack 
 out of all the dowels 2-3 were of shorter length. This made entire cloth dryer unstable & useless.. I thought they would first check the product (assemble once) and send it.. dont think they did 
 This is not one of my favorites. It was a ok read with not alot of action and the ending I wish could have had a little more excitment.The interaction between Jack and Daisy seemed alittle forced with her telling him he's not her type and there was no chemistry between them, something was missing there for me. The way Howard described Jack - graying hair, thick neck, body builder, is that supposed to be attractive? I felt Howard wrote more about the puppys antics than she cared to write about the romance or action. The book was worth reading if you have nothing else to read or important to do. It just could have been so much better. Not up to Howards usual books 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 I'll preface this by saying I'm a cryer.  I cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining.  I cried all the way through Superman Returns.  I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle.  In English class, I always learned to "show, not tell" when writing.  When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful.  Sparks is the master of telling without showing.  I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets.  The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff.  But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), "He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer.  After opening it, he sat down on the back deck."  Or, "Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table."  "She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt."  Have you read enough yet?  I'm new to the romance genre.  My mother-in-law recommended Sparks because -- I think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic.  They were to me, but then, I'm new to romance, and spoiled by the masterful, unequaled storytelling skill of Stephen King.  Please hold your New York Times bestsellers to a higher standard.  Let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music, movies, and literature 
 This book's premise is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75 pages.  We meet the two main characters and learn interesting things about their lives.  Arlette is the 'book doctor,' and the query letters that are interspersed with the action are very entertaining.  I loved reading about this side of publishing...  Then I hit the wall.  Too much discussion in the text about feelings, nothing more than feelings...I started skimming.  The dialogue started disappearing.  The query letters sent to Arlette all started sounding the same, as though the author had lost her ability to change voice.  I gave up at page 130, regretfully.  I stopped caring about the characters, but I wanted to like the book more and couldn't 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 This book provides a cursory treatment of a deep subject.  At barely 250 pages of main body text--and they are small pages at that, set in a generous type--there is no room to go into detail on much of anything.  You will learn, perhaps, what a dataflow diagram or an IDEF0 frame is, but you will certainly not learn how to create or manipulate them, or much about how to use them, or their relative strengths and weaknesses, beyond the casual sentence or two about any given model in this book.  And, look, I love diagrams, but it seems like every third illustration is this book is a reprint or an absolutely trivial variation on the author's "EA Cube" overview diagram.  You can see it on the front cover--it's not exactly as complicated as the human nervous system.  Once or twice would have done it for me.  Shallow?  I slosh through deeper puddles on a rainy day.    But the shining feature of this book is the "case study" of a company adopting the particular flavor of Enterprise Architecture that Scott Bernard is trying to sell, something called EA3.  He follows this ficticious company through the entire course of the book, costing a substantial fraction of the already meager pagecount.  What would you expect such a case study to entail, dear reader?  Maybe some process diagrams, data entity schemas, architecture documents...you know, an ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE for the example company?  Sadly, the joke is on us.  None of this is forthcoming.  The "case study" consists almost entirely of descriptions of meetings where everybody talks about the wonderful things they're going to do with this new enterprise architecture, followed by more meetings where everybody congatulates each other on the wonderful things they've just done thanks to enterprise architecture.  Like the rest of the book, there is just no "there" there.  Actual models?  No room!  Sample documents?  No time!  Any business school or MIS student who tried to hand in this pollyanna sales pitch as a "case study" would only get an F because the grade scale doesn't go to "G."  Perhaps the only value in this book is that, if read critically, it will teach you a great deal about why "Enterprise Architecture" has such a poor reputation in certain sectors of industry today.  I really think that a lot of EA is about self-aggrandizement on the part of IT professionals, who think the entire business should revolve around their pretty diagrams and three-ring binders.  We in the IT community need to get our minds right: we are here to support and enable the business, not impede it or, worse, subordinate it to its tools.  If something like Enterprise Architecture is good for business, then we need to find ways to do it that don't involve saying to the people we are supposed to be helping: "Wait!  Stop what you're doing and redefine everything you do according to MY methodology!"  Read the first five pages of the "case study" in this book to see the new CIO do EXACTLY THAT.  He should have been laughed out of the boardroom.    
 Agree with the other reviewer...this is simply the Premiere 6 Adobe user's manual with the bible cover. The only real diference is that they use more pictures (screenshots) to illustrate. I read the Adobe manual, and it was fairly useless. I looked at this book for about 30 minutes at the university bookstore and it literally followed the same sequence as the manual. Clearly, not worth $40+ as there are better books available 
 As a Japanese Horror film enthusiast, I was very disappointed. I feel it is a blatant rip-off of The Grudge/ Ju On. Parts of it are very scary, but it really made no sense. I'm glad I didn't pay money for this DVD and watched it on On Demand Cable, instead. Blah... 
 "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" is a history of that villain we all love to hate from the L. Frank Baum children's classic, The Wizard of Oz. I hate to write a completely negative review, so I'll start with something good. I finished it. Even that is not saying so much, since I rarely abandon a book in mid-read.  My most lasting impression of Wicked is that it just doesn't fit with the characters as I know them. In this book the Wizard is a corrupt tyrant; the Wicked Witch of the East is an (admittedly disliked) political leader and religious influence in Munchkinland; Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, cares more about fashion and society than true good works; and the central character, the Wicked Witch of the West, is not really wicked, nor is she technically even a witch, though she is still decidedly green. The lengthy philosophical discussions of politics, religion, animal rights, the nature of evil, and the presence or absence of souls felt empty and out of place with the colorful and imaginative Oz I love. Here, Oz seems dreary and unrecognizable. I don't dislike philosophy, but I missed the fantasy. In author Gregory Maguire's telling, life in Oz is bleak.  I had hoped this book would give me a new appreciation for why the witch (named Elphaba--a take on L. Frank Baum's initials) is the way she is. What I got instead was a mostly uninteresting character whose story went nowhere. I admire the attempt to humanize a villainess, but presenting her as a (somewhat) complex and (somewhat) sympathetic character makes her actions against Dorothy, not all of which are documented here, so much the less believable. Sometimes the villain just needs to be a villain! Confusingly, Maguire has taken too many liberties with the original The Wizard of Oz, ignoring some key scenes and reinventing others to suit his purposes.  It's nearly impossible to separate this book from its roots in the work upon which it purports to be based, but even as a stand-alone novel, it fails. Maguire hints at ideas and plot points that either never come together or are completely abandoned. The bottom line is that I love books I can't put down. This one put me to sleep. Literally. I finished it, but only because I really wanted to like it and hoped for some redeeming conclusion. It simply did not live up to the potential of its intriguing premise 
 Having worked on Wall Street for 25 years, by and from experience I can assert that ANY economic behavior by any human does entail a marginal error toward/from the misinterpreted phrase "zero sum game.Simply research historic Federal Reserve monetary policy to understand this, let alone structured finance! Prof. Thurow's point is that the US political economy, its citizens, and those "elites" who make its policy are asymetrically informed. Sooner or later, the US has to restructure its misapplication of redistributing wealth; hence the shock of the 70's, the long-term mess Regan has left; the stock bubble of the mid-90's; the current housing bubble.  Another shock a la 1973 and 1978 might redirect this country's "elites'" thinking towards more long-term pragmatic lines 
 honestly, i tried to find something good to say about this vacumn cleaner. alas, i could not find a big enough positive that would offset all the negatives.the predominant minus is the heat factor, this unit gets way too hot! as with any size motor, overheating will drastically reduce the motor life. the hepa filter may be a good thing, but the constant cleaning of it is time consuming and messy.it is cheaply made, definitely not built to last very long. i could say more,but i believe the overheating aspect should convince most folks not to waste their time or money on this unit 
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading all Ms. Blackstock's other books, but this series, Second Chances, has left me disappointed.  The character development is slow and shallow.  It's actually difficult to like the woman  who cares more for herself than her child.  Wes comes across as wimpy.   There is no suspense or action in this book that makes her other novels  more enjoyable.  I would much rather recomment her Newpoint 911 and Sun  Coast Chronicles series 
 I'm going to go against the grain and say this disc is better suited for a hi-rez on-hold playlist for a bank.  I am not a huge smooth jazz fan, but after reading the reviews about this DVD-A disc I figured I'd give it a shot.  Yes, from a fidelity standpoint this is top notch.  But I couldn't get past a minute of any of the songs.  Long story short, there are tons of great DVD-A and SACD discs out there.  If ultra-smooth jazz is not your thing, don't bother with this one 
 I recently purchased - and returned - a Bowflex Ultimate 2 and I wanted to convey just how disappointed I was with the whole experience.    My equipment arrived on January 10th.  As I opened the boxes, I realized that not only were there no assembly instructions, there weren't any user instructions on how to modify the machine to do the different exercises.  I contacted Bowflex immediately and was told that a mistake had been made, but that I could download the assembly instructions from the website.  I was also told that a user manual would be sent to me.    One week later on January 17th, I contacted Bowflex because I had not yet received the user guide and because during the assembly of the Ultimate 2, I noticed that one of the plastic balls that prevents the cables from coming off the cables was broken.  The representative I spoke to again pledged to send me a user manual and a replacement ball so that I could use the machine.  I asked if they could be overnighted because the machine was unusable to me with the broken ball (which allowed the cable to pull through) and without a users guide.  The representative said she would expedite the order but that she could not overnight it.  She told me she  could not tell me for certain when it would arrive.     By the end of day, Friday, January 19th, it was apparent to me that the items would not be arriving before the weekend and that it would be more than three weeks from the day I ordered the machine before I would be able to use it.  It was very frustrating to me that Bowflex would not overnight these items so I could fix and use the machine as soon as possible.  These items did not arrive until 7 days later, making it a full month from the date of my order before the equipment would have been functional.    For these reasons, I elected to return the equipment to Bowflex.  I was expecting far better customer service for something that cost over $2,000.  Making matters far worse was the cost for me to return the items to Bowflex.  Using UPS as Bowflex recommended and knowing that the cost for Bowflex to ship the items to me was about $200, I expected it to cost about $200 to ship the items back to Washington.  However, because all returns must go to Virginia, the cost to ship the items via UPS Ground in the original boxes to Virginia was $489 - more than double the original amount.  I'm assuming that two reasons explain the cost difference 1) Bowflex must get some sort of discount from UPS for all of its shipping traffic 2) naturally, it is more expensive to ship from California to Virginia than it is to ship to Washington.  Regardless of the reason, my Bowflex ownership experience was only made worse by the fact that I had to spend 25% of the original purchase price to ship the item back.    This whole experience has made it very difficult for me to ever have anything good to say to anyone about my experience owning Nautilus equipment.  
 As much as I tried to get into the book, I felt like there was too much effort to talk about a whole lot of things in a short time. There were so many events that took place, and not enough time spent to explain clearly the situation, or give a better history to the dynamics of what was happening...  I also felt that the translation could have taken a lot of what the real intent was. I was not able to live the story, and get involved to what was taking place...    
 Question the analytical ability of an author who, in recommending the Sills recording of "Julius Caesar,"  thinks that the Italian text is sung in English.  More to the point, ignore a critic who clearly doesn't listen to the recordings he evaluates 
 WHY DID SHE FEEL THE NEED TO KNOCK REPUBLICANS AT EVERY TURN?  A REAL SIGN OF LOW INTELLIGENCE.  SPOILED BOOK COMPLETELY.  SHE IS VERY OPINIONATED IN ALL HER THOUGHTS AND FILTHY TALK TO BOOT...THINKS SHE IS SOPHISTICATED...BAH.  BAD BOOK 
 3 cups? I don't know where this teeny thing would equal that- not even 3 demitasse/espresso cups.  Amazon really should make the 'See larger image' say 'See life size' (try it)... or better yet show something for scale- like 10 coffee beans- the amount it holds.  So, I'm already kinda down on this Liliputian trinket and I check instructions to see if I can heat the water in the microwave- like I do with my other 'real size' French press (without the top).  No, nothing saying that should be a problem...  2 minutes later the rubber bottom mat is burning furiously in my microwave !  I'd hope Hugo had a 'BonJour' because I certainly didn't.. 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 HERE IS SOME USEFULL INFO I FOUND first D-Link makes some great stuff but the D-Link DGS-2208  is not one of them    first tech support is useless they know nothing untill you get a 4-5 level of support (45 min.) the way to get info out of them is to call the (LOCAL) sales desk punch in the keys for presales question   and from that sales desk call "IT WILL NOT WORK WELL IN MIXED MODES"  from this info i sent mine back to for a full refund  here are 2 reviews i found   Pros: Fanless. Seems sturdy enough.  Cons: Won't work well for a mixed network.  I bought this swtich hoping to use it with my gigabit connected computers along with my 100mbit connected computers. I checked ahead of time, making sure the description for the product said it could work in a mixed speed network. What they didnt mention, is that if used in a mixed speed network (100mbit and 1000mbit connections to it at the same time) it will run at the slowest connected speed. I found out by noticing it wasnt any faster than my previous 100mbit network. I emailed their tech support asking and they respondeded with  It will run at the slowest speed connected   So this means that if your router, computer, AP, or ANY ethernet device that runs at 100mbit is attached to it, it will make all 8 of its ports run at 100mbit, regarldess if all the other ports have 1000mbit connected devices.   here is another bad one i found  Pros: Jumbo frames, cheap Cons: Doesnt work worth beans in a mixed speed environment. If you have 2 computers with 100mbit adapters and 2 with 1000mbit adapters, the switch will run ALL ports at 100mbit, effectively making the gigab... More » it adapters run at 100mbit. Have a 10/100 router or 100mbit adapter in ANY of the computers thats going to be connected to this switch and your wasting your time if you think you can hookup your gigabit adapters and expect gigabit speeds.  Other Thoughts: I wish someone else had mentioned its problem in a review before I bought it. I had checked their product sheet and read through reviews about this switch with no mention that it shunts all ports to the slowest connected speed. There isnt any support on Dlinks website for this product nor knowledgebase. I found out that it shunts the ports to the slowest speed by emailing them and getting a single line response of "It is limited to the slowest connection." with a "internet email confidentiality statement" indicating that the information in the email is intended only for my personal use and is private/confidential. Brilliant   
 I did not receive this item until now, august 7. Why? Best regards,  Flavio Joze 
 First of all, let me this out of the way: There was nothing wrong with the way these DVD were covering the season from 2003 back. Nothing wrong with looking at the season of racing as a season and not a showcase for chase drivers. Please go back to it.  Based on that, folks can take my review with a grain of salt or not.  My second problem is that there is double introduction, the second of which is painfully long and cliché ridden. So much so I had to turn off the TV twice. Seriously, whoever wrote that narrative needs to graduate High School first. It was horribly over-the-top melodramatic and just non-stop cliches. The intros are for people who are completely unfamiliar with the sport, which market wise, I sort of get. But the fact is newbies aren't buying these DVD's. Fans are, you don't need to explain and sell the sport to us again.  The approach of looking at the various racing teams was a nice way to come at covering how the year went for the "big names", but that left out a lot of other drivers. There are 43 cars in the field each week and this DVD covers, maybe, 15 of them? It also failed to point out how the single and double car teams struggled. The coverage often did not specify in what races/tracks events/incidents happened, so that if this DVD is for newbies (as suggested by the double intro), it would be extremely confusing.  It also left out the swirling rumor of mill of one of the silliest "Silly Seasons" NASCAR has ever seen with all the speculation and seat changing that happened between 2005-2006. Thought it was funny that they pointed out Ricky Rudd's remarkable career, then forgot to mention he lost his ride. Sterling too. They also didn't mention someone's shocks at Dover or other incidents that had the fanbase talking for weeks.  The extras were..o.k.. Tell us something we don't know that we might be interested in, that what DVD extras are for! I did like the meeting at Roush where we got to see Jack Roush reaction to the initial "shot across the bow" when France suggesting limiting the number of cars an organization can field. But that was pretty much it. It actually would have nice to expand on that for a mini-documentary to get reactions of owners, CC and drivers across the board. Sort of like the "What makes a good crew chief?" from last year's DVD.  The good things? They had a lot of great radio chatter. Thumbs up on that. Often when fans are watching a race we don't get the hear the funny stuff on TV, or if we are at the race we only hear our driver. It's nice to hear drivers cracking jokes, makes the entire experience more human. We got to see some angle of incidents that we didn't get to in regular coverage too.   I really, really wish these guys would get their act together on these things. I don't collect much NASCAR stuff, but I look forward to getting these at the end of the year: A nice scrapbook of the season. The last two years it's been pretty lame.  
 I was very displeased when I received the Feuilles de Brick. I had to cater for an important client. All the ingredients ready to be  assembled in the Feuilles and due to their dryness (the Feuilles de Brick) I could not bake my desserts 
 I don't remember seeing Isild Le Besco in any other films, but she does look a bit familiar.  If I have seen her elsewhere, it must have been in a role that she performed with much greater insight and finesse than Gwen from 'Girl's Can't Swim', or I definitely would remember.  I'm still not sure what the title actually means... something about young women struggling to find their way... blah blah blah... but, it actually wasn't a terrible film.  Nevertheless, Le Besco's performance is one of the most irritating I've seen in years.  I was reminded of Dorothy Parker's cutting remark when critiquing a Katherine Hepburn film: 'She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.'   Le Besco was either shown with an extremely obnoxous smile plastered on her face, or she was smacking her friends or family in a 'hissy fit of rage'.  These tantrums always ended with Gwen running off to the sea with all the grace of a three-legged moose.  What made LeBesco's performance stand out even more was the fact that everyone else's performances were nearly flawless. This film was recommended to me after purchasing 'L'Effrontee', a truly marvelous picture.  While watching the first 30 minutes of 'Girl's Can't Swim' I could see that I was not the only person who admired 'L'Effontee's' subtle brilliance.  Obviously the director and/or screenwriter of 'Girl's Cant' Swim' intended on building upon the other film's message, but as a lark, they subtracted all of its poignance and sensitivity. I give the film 2 out of 5 because, despite its flaws, it is still superior to the vast majority of 'toejam' that hollywood produces each year 
 While the story was very entertaining and the high expected quality from Gemmell it was quite disappointing because of the references to Troy with Trojan and Mycenean heroes.   Gemmell has obviously done his research of the Trojan war because even minor heroes such as Glaucus, Ajax and Anchises are mentioned. However, almost none of the characters are who they are in the Trojan Saga and is very disappointing to see how Gemmell disgraces characters in the book when they were heroes in the Trojan war (ie. Glaucus became very close with Diomedes and both lived to adulthood & became heroes. Glaucus also traded his bronze armor for Diomedes' gold armor during the war, which has not yet occurred).  Also major characters like Agamemnon & Anchises are killed at the wrong time and by the wrong people, much like Glaucus and Diomedes who are already dead but should have lived to the Trojan war. The personalities and actions developed by the characters also do not match their true character in the Iliad. I dont understand why he cannot just use different names if he wants the story to take place in the same era instead of using hero names, changing their entire lives and contradicting the Iliad. 
 This book is apparently not well researched and has at least three errors so far and I am not a fifth finished with it.  For one on page 71: "After signing the treaty, (The Treaty of Alliance between the United States and France) Franklin, Deane, and Adams were officially presented to the king..."  Unger means Arthur Lee, not Adams.  The treaty was signed on February 6, 1778, the presentation ceremony was March 22.  John Adams didn't arrive in Paris until April 8.  This is pitiful and I could list the other errors and I certainly will if it is requested.  But I resent the time involved to do it, they are not my errors!  Why the Library Journal claims this is a "well-researched" biography one can only speculate.  The (few?) errors make the whole suspect.  A sad event for publishing.  Perhaps we should wait another 20 years for an accurate book 
 This is the worst book I've read on critical thinking and logic. The examples the author uses are terrible....quite dull 
 This book is NOT good. Period. It does no justice whatsoever to the title that it bears. I feel so cheated that I bought this book and the price is even more outrageous ($148).For instance,nothing,and I mean nothing, is at all compelling, maybe I should say, interesting about its treatment of Simulation (among other topics)in Chapter 10. It is absolutely appalling. Why even mention Lagrange Interpolation,etc when you are not ready to divulge more information, even as it pertains to the design of Thermal Sytems?.I don't think that practicing engineers (according to the editorial review) will be interested in this sort of treatment of thermal systems. In the event that you are interested in the overall picture of thermal systems, I suggest that you take a look at the excellent exposition by W.F. Stocker in "Design of Thermal Systems". This one is targeted at the "higher" audience but is well worth the efforts spent in following it up.  I should ideally give this book a single star but for the rather excellent compendium of engineering ethics in Chapter 3 
 This book does have lots of good information, but the author could have at least used spellcheck.  There are spelling errors on almost every page, as well as a few missing words spread around the book.  There are even a few places that the author copy and pasted an entire paragraph.  All of this left me thinking of this book as being cheap and I had to question the validity of the information if the author doesn't even bother to check for errors in his own book 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 I love the Firebird imprint and was excited to read this book and "Ecstasia", its predecessor.  Ugh.  I barely made it through this quadmire of perverse sex and terrible poetry.  I find it completely inappropriate for a teen novel (yes, I know, teens have sex) to be so overtly sexual.  Every page, every paragraph practically was full of plain ol' sex, bestiality, masturbation, homosexual and bisexuality.  Sure, it was couched in flowery prose and open-ended verse, but it still boils down to pornography when you take away the fluff.  And, while Primavera's childish songs were marginally better than the ones in "Ecstasia", I'm still hard-pressed to imagine how anyone could sing meterless, beat-less, pointless verse like that.  Never mind that it didn't rhyme, I'd like to see the tune that could follow any one of those arbitrary lines!  Bleah 
  I haven't purchased the book yet, though I think I will.  I truly beleive that whatever child you get is a blessing from God and only He will decide the sex. However, I also believe in doing whatever you can, on your own  to tip the scale and then leave it to Him.  My husband and I have a beautiful, smart, funny, blind little boy.  His blindness comes froma genetic disease that is 99% more likely to coour in males, so we would like to have a girl next.  We checked into gender selection thorugh spinning and they only give an 85% chance as well.  IVF is not an option due to finances. If we try and the gender selection works, we will add some stars on the review. However, our son is the light of our lives and we re incredibly blessed to have him despite and because of his blindness.  We will remember and hope you will too, that any child..boy, girl perfect or with special needs is a blessing and we will love him or her no matter what.  
 My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years. Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent. Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless. Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper. If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere 
 I was excited to read the book because it talked about even how unattractive or intelligent women can be seductresses.  However, all the author talked about was how the various artists, intellectuals, and adventurers used sex to get what they wanted from men.  Basically, the author reduces women to physical beings and tries to justify this treatment by comparing the women in her book to the Sumerian goddess, Inanna.  There was no everlasting love for these women, a myth if there ever was one.  And then Prioleau claims that if women reclaim their sexual selves, they will gain the everlasting love that has been eluding them.  Essentially, the book is BS and I wouldn't give this book to anyone.  I would actually advise friends and family members to avoid it at all costs.  It just perpetuates the image of women as sexual creatures to be used by men in exchange for power, money, fame, and security.  
 Harder to get into than I first thought.  The kids are anxious to get to "work" and fidget getting into this, the arms are a bit too tight.  It seems bulky as well.  Better off going old school - daddy's old shirt on backwards 
 A good book to leave lying around in dentist's waiting rooms, but if you actually want to concentrate on reading about Shakespeare you'll need something much more grown-up. Anyone with such a short attention-span as this book imagines its readers to suffer from would have trouble getting to the end of a Shakespeare sonnet, never mind a whole play. This book is all bright pictures and sound-bites -- it's completely facile, a series of short-cuts to the aspects of Shakespeare which for some reason people think high school students need. They probably aren't the ones you want anyway. 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 What can you say about "Dead & Breakfast"?  I picked this up at the store not knowing much about it other than it had a cute title, clever holographic packaging, a few decent reviews and a young, appealing cast.  I can say that the charms, unfortunately, of the actual film are relatively limited.  Pretty standard fare, really--I didn't necessarily dislike it--I just felt that it was so obvious in its intention.  This film wants to be cool.  It was designed to (hopefully) be a cult classic.  It wants you to revel in its self-aware kookiness.  But that's just the problem.  Taking its cues from so many better movies, this is a self-indulgent and unoriginal mess.  The cast and filmmakers seem to be having a good time--you know this was a party set.  It seems as if they feel that they are doing us a great service by letting us in on the joke.  Well, I've heard the joke--so don't do me any favors.  I'm not saying that there aren't some amusing moments--how can you fail with redneck zombies?  And musical numbers are always fun.  And the TV-ready cast will be familiar to many, even if you can't always place from where.  The movie imagines that it's "Evil Dead 2," but it lacks real cleverness.  It works slightly better as a comedy than anything else, but it's hard for me to imagine anyone being captivated by this 
 I thought this book was good but then all her others were too. I guess when you are a popular author the fear of failure may be so strong that you will stick to what works and what sells - the same alpha male and sassy female. Usually, I have no problems with this because given the same type of people in different situations and surroundings, they may develop differently or respond differently, but unfortunately, the surroundings are just masked differently but are actually the same. Now that is where the problem lies - its the same book with a different jacket and not the same characters within different situations (which I would be ok with). I think Laurens has become commercialized - too commercialized. When you grab a book and it feels like going to the supermarket and grabbing a brand of cereal - you know you are in trouble. Try Teresa Medeiros (love this woman), Elizabeth Thornton, Laura Lee Ghurke, Barbara Dan (newcomer) - you won't be disappointed. For some reason, Christina Dodd, Nora Roberts, Jennifer Blake, Virgina Henley, Stephanie Laurens, Lisa Kleypas, Cathy Maxwell, Connie Mason, Jo Beverly, Connie Brockway, and a few more I cannot remember seems to be very popular but for me, so hard to like any of their books. Does anyone else out there feel the same way 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 I was tempted to be stupid and buy an updated version of one of his books. The older bigger one I had ordered from a Home Shopping network about 6years ago. From the reviews I see it's the same story. The phone numbers are out of service or have new people answering them for different places. You know you always want to believe help is possible. Unfortunately it isn't though from him as he's only helping himself to your money 
 The book is ok.  There are certainly good points.  The characters are extremely underdeveloped, however, and seem to be mere characatures. They could have been a lot better.  The book would definitely be better off as a film.    Fitzhugh also has some serious issues with New York City.  Unless there was a joke I missed, he must HATE it.  He spends 15-20% of the book describing how awful, dirty, and crime-filled it is.  All landlords are scummy, all the subway riders are crazy, or dirty, or "suits."  Cabbies carry guns and will use them, and so does everyone one else.  Even if this were still true, it detracts from the book 
 Doesn't work on coarse hairs.  Doesn't remove, only trims.  Okay for fine light hair--of course, if you have fine, light hair, you don't need to try to remove 
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 I almost put the book down after a 100 pages as I couldn't figure out what it was about or where it was going. The ending was equally bad, the book just goes no where besides talking about anti establishment type themes. Horrible. 
 not my favorite of their products. The rasins are Hard and sometimes Burnt, it takes to long to soften. 
 As some of the previous authors have already noted, this book is cleary marked for the conspiracy minded, and those who hate the Japanese monarchy.  It is revisionist history at its extreme.  Also it takes a lot of swipes at the Republican Party, even though it is a book about the Japanese monarchy.  It is dedicated to Diane Fienstein, the liberal Democratic Senator from California.  Where to begin? Up to Chapter 9, this was a very believable book.  It discussed the Meiji and Tashio Emperors and the first stages of Hirohito's rule.  Then it became unbelievable.  First it talked about how Roosevelt let Pearl Harbor happen.  There have been many books about this but suffice to say, this is VERY REVISIONIST, and probably not true.  Then it questions the courage of MacArthur.  Most historians don't debate his courage, but the Seagraves thought they could throw it in there.  It also suggested MacArthur was interested in the 1940 Republican nomination, when this is clearly not true.  Then it talks about the 1936 coup attempt in Tokyo as being very liberal, when in fact they were very militeristic and anti democractic.  This book takes swipes at Hoover as encouraging the corruption of the post war Japanese government and suggested he took a bribe of several million dollars.  Hoover devoted most of his life to public service and charities, so it is hard to believe the Seagrave's nonsense.  Then there were all the stories of the billions of dollars of gold and gems looted from the conquered Asian countries.  There were so many billions tossed around as sure facts, that I lost track if there was that much gold in the world. The Seagraves then detail all the corruption of post war Japan and blame it on Americans, the monarchy, and the rich strata of Japan.  It was hard to read this stuff when the documentation is just not there.   This is a hard book to swallow.  Part of this book is history, and the last 100 pages is pure fiction.  When an author puts one controversial subject in a book, it is open to discussion.  These authors threw in literally a hundred controversial subjects (loot, gold, blame for Pearl Harbor, corruption,) and ask the reader to believe them.  Please!!!!  Stick to the facts Seagraves, and no more treasure stories.  One gets sick of so much fantasy in a history book.   
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 If you are thinking about buying this CD, I'm betting it is because you heard "100 years" on the radio and you thought it was such a great song, you wanted to check out what else John Ondrasik or Five For Fighting was capable of. Let me save you the trouble, the answer is not much. This CD is unbelievably dull, surprisingly vulgar at times given the theme and context of the hit single, and really just poorly constructed. Just because you enjoyed "100 Years" or even "Superman" which are both very good songs, don't be fooled into thinking you might like the rest of the albums. There is a reason that you only hear one hit single from each of FFF's albums, the other songs just aren't worth the listen. Really, very dissapointing 
 This book DOES provide enough information to build pro loudspeakers.  There is good coverage of pro loudspeaker construction, so if you want to know how to build a box, this is the book for you.  When it comes to design, this book is very lacking.  There is a fair section on cross over design (1st & 2nd order only).  But when it comes to enclosure design, the author suggests the reader use speaker design software (not provided) with no guidance on what these programs do.  Nice!  The book does a great job of emphasizing frequency response and efficiency matching, but some of the design examples are are a little unorthodox.  Specifically, there is a 12" PA speaker design where the author recommends a 6dB cross over point of 4kHz.  This may protect the horn, but sacrifices off axis frequency response.  Most commercial 12" PA speakers will use a lower cross over point ~ 2kHz and use a 2nd or 3rd order cross over.  Bottom line, if you want to know how to build boxes, this is a good book.  If you want to know how to design enclosures, you will need another book or software.  I rated this book low because the title "Design and Build . . ." suggested to me that there would be better design guidelines.  So while I rated this book one star, other readers may find this a useful reference for pro speaker construction. 
 It's not surprising that Brad Gooch, a professional homosexual, writes a book that makes Frank O'Hara appear to be nothing more than another professional homosexual. Actually, Gooch may be right. O'Hara is an incredibly minor figure in American poetry, and this books devotes too much print to a third-rate writer who would probably best be forgotten 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 i would strongly advise not to purchase this with the percussion as it gets in the way of the cadence.  personally the drum/tap to keep pace on the cd seems primary to the cadence which it is not.  and if you can't keep pace with the d.i. yelling left right left, you've got other problems.. 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!! It doesn't fix anything at all. I followed the directions exactly. Did nothin what so ever to fix the scratches. The only thing that one might be able to use is the blue stuff in the 2 bottle. That can be used to wipe smudges off of cds. Besides that, AVOID AT ALL COSTS! 
 I would not be surprised if suddenly I discovered that all the 5 stars reviews are product of Jeffrey Gitomer's connections, friends, fans or family. When I read that if you want to meet a CEO, don't use the telephone and give him a "cold-call", you better send him a daily fax for 5 consecutive days with a lead or contact of a customer interested in his company (?!), and THEN call him and tell him you are the guy who sent him these great referrals! Wow, I just wonder if the sales team of this CEO did take Jeffreys sales seminars and got nothing while you, a simple mortal, got 5 great customers in one week for them! It has more like this, like "call all the people you know and ask them: What can I do for you today?", etc. On the other hand, it opens your eyes to really think seriously about your connections, but I suppose you already do, otherwise you wouldn't be reading these reviews and looking for a book like this. Keep looking and if you find nothing, then think about buying this one, it is not that expensive 
 I was enthusiastic about this book when I first scanned it at the bookstore.  Later, after trying a few recipes and spending more time with it, I found it to be mediocre.  
 I'm pretty new in the trading world also but I have to go with the crowd and say that this was the absolute worst book ever on day trading. Whatever you do, don't buy this one! Get a toni turner book or something, but NOT this one. Alot has changed since 1999 so it's understood how some techniques can't be used anymore, but this was garbage even back then.   He repeats everything hundreds of times throughout the book, "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread"  "you are the middleman" "you are the middleman"  In a bookstore read the first page of the foreword, it says that he was signed the book deal(1st one) even before he wrote it as a 23 year old. Proof enough that it's hot garbage 
 The book presents translation theory and information on the history of translation.  It lists proverbs with their translations as well as cognates and false cognates.  There's humorous examples of bad translations.  Therefore, after reading it, you will know how to evaluate the quality of a translation without having been given much practice in translating.  If you're looking for a book on translation theory, this will be a fine introduction.  It isn't as good if you need to learn to translate 
 Ms. Mayes puts her nose in the air about tourists - and what does she think she is except a tourist with a little more time for her travels than most of the rest of us?  Got news for you, Ms. Mayes - just because you can spend a month in a country when most of the rest of us have a week or 10 days doesn't make you any less a tourist.  And your sneers at your fellow/sister Americans aren't going to win you any more readers in the long run.  On second thought, this level of snotty self-satisfaction and loathing for America and Americans is what I guess I expect from academics these days. 
 Don't bother.  Just don't bother.  It's sad to see 
 I wanted to like this book: but often asking writers such questions brings on words that are not spontaneous and that though they may be competent in intellectualism, they are impoverished in beauty and in gutsiness, which is the kind of writing that truly sings. Since time to read is limited for most persons, it might be good to read the original materials and forget about the rehashed commentary. I would far rather see a diamond than read about one 
 99 mins of suck..good thing i don't have a life..some nudity (eva mendes' fun bags?) definitely would have raised this movie another star..couldn't wait to look at the talent files(he he)  after the movie was over..can't wait for the next one 
 I read through this book and got amazed how the Indiana University even considered attaching its name to it. Because this is total falsification of the Georgian history and straightforwardly an INSULT to any person who has ever had any positive emotions towards Georgia. Don't waste your time, this book will mislead you 
 I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted.  
 I'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not Cussler's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his?  Way too many characters - I'm no dummy, but I have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the "cast of characters" he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters.  The story isn't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are, there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it.  I hope it gets better as it goes along, but I doubt it 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 Very poor choice for a cover photo. Jason should have been a man and took off his mask. This is really a book for diehard redsox fans only. The avrage baseball fan will choke on it. Stephen king should stick to what he does best,, Horror. Maybe he should write about this Redsox season 
 The author spends the entire book describing his highly romanticized time travelling with three "gypsies" he picks up in order to follow "the paths" of their ancestors.  Highly speculative, his theories are so fanciful (think "Foucault's Pendulum" style associations) and without corroboration that, while they may be fascinating and interesting 'what-ifs' for people versed in Rromani studies, I am afraid this book will only spread more misconceptions, spawn unrigorous standards in research undertakings and give an even worse name to 'gadje' ethnographers than they already have made for themselves.  He stereotypes various clans and nations to make them fit into his limited perspective of them (i.e. he wants there to be a natisye of "entertainers," another of "tinkers" etc) so as to concoct a hypothetical story of diaspora.  Unless you've read EVERY other book out there on the subject, skip this one.  If you're looking for a good primer, especially as a 'gadjo', go with Ian Hancock's book "We Are the Romani People."  Sadly, Moreau's journey was much more fun for him to live than it is for us to read 
 I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said "So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it." I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it! Divorce is against God's law, and I feel extremely strong about this. I cannot believe the message Ann M. Martin is sending to readers!  
 Yann Tiersen produces some truely amazing music.  Get Good Bye Lenin, and also check out Amelie and Rue De Cascades.  But, as stated by another reviewer, be aware that this disc will not work in many CD players, and especially computer CD rom drives.  Apparently this is because the 'copy protection' on the disc breaks the CD standard.  I would suggest buying the music on-line 
 well, i thought that the book was coming. when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder.  they did let me get a refund which was nice.  i would use them again for that reason alone.  
 Bought this toaster less than two months ago and it's already broken. The control buttons (one of the reasons why we bought it) are not functioning, neither is the darkness control knob. Once it's put into the toast position, it does not shut off, you have to push up the lever manually. My son put in some Toaster Swirls only to set off the smoke alarm. This is the second time a product (a rice cooker)from this brand has broken within months of purchase. I'm just going to avoid Oster at all costs in the future 
 You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the "Frog King" which is unreadable.  Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper.  This does not do justice to the tales 
 I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book.  Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal.  If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters.  My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret.  Your husband will get a lot more out of it!! 
 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 I've been confused by Michael Medved's position on film ever sinse he posed a question in the wall Street Journal asking "What happened to the missing moviegoers?".  He was speaking about the end of the Production Code (censorship) in Hollywood, and how that coincided with a drop off in movie attendance.    Yes--movies seriously changed in the late 60s, as filmmakers were allowed to depict subject matter previously forbidden.  I'm not sure what he is trying to prove here.  Everyone stopped going to the movies because of this?  So, it had nothing to do with attendance dropping since the mid-50s, with Vietnam, with the death of urban movie palaces and the total change of the movie going experience, the public's boredom with overblown "roadshow attractions" , with television?    No, actually, because in Mr. Medved's world you can trace anything and everything to a lack of morals.  He points out that the "Sound of Music" won best Picture in 1965, and then "Midnight Cowboy" (about a male hustler) won Best picture in 1969, thereby proving the decline and fall of western civilization.    So, I guess nevermind how many "family" movies of this time period ("Hello Dolly," "Doctor Dolittle", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang," "Greatest Story Ever Told") were total and complete bombs at the box office.    He states that removal of the production code (remember, the decline and fall of western civilization) "hurt the bottom line." And apparently movies have just been utter "filth" ever since?  So, Christians would be hypocritical to own DVDs of the films that came out just after the removal of the Code, that could not have been made before it: "The Wild Bunch," "The Grauduate," "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," "The Producers," "Rosemary's Baby," "Midnight Cowboy," "Bonnie and Clyde."    All of those movies did great at the box office, by the way.  So I'm lost as to how the removal of the Production Code wrecked "the bottom line" in Hollywood.   Oh yes, one other thing:  Michael Medved did the glowing introduction to DeMille's "The Ten Commandments" at the Conservative Film Festival (or whatever its called) in 2004.    DeMille's 1932 film "The Sign of The Cross," jam-packed with violence, sexual perversion, [...]), helped contribute to the Catholic revolt against films, and the enforcement of the Code itself.  Some "scholar" you guys got here.  
 If you like beautifully shot, well acted films with plot lines and twists that have more holes that one of those huge wheels of swiss cheese you find at the cheese maker, this film is for you.  The most impressive slight of hand here is that viewers thought this was a great story.  I don't get it.  The story fails so miserably I can't understand how this "thing" got made.  Speaking of cheese, watch closely (as the opening narrative instructs us).  Indeed.  This film does not stand up to even the lightest level of scrutiny.  I can't tell you why without spoiling the film but here goes, you've been warned.  The entire premise of the "scientific" trick (or Tesla's REAL magic trick) at the end of the movie makes absolutely no sense at all if you are the guy doing the trick you are going to die.  If you think about all those hats out in the woods and the cat, then who ever uses the device replicates himself (the person standing inside the device) and shows up in another place not to far from the device.  If you are standing in the device you are going to die as soon as that trap door opens.  Watch it and think about it for a few minutes.  It does not make any sense without killing the original magician.    Also, there are far too many contrived scenes where the magicians are sabotaging one another after being picked to assist in a trick from among the crowd.  One will put on a disguise, go to the other's show, get picked to assist and then sabotage the trick.  How could they keep picking each other, even with the disguise, out of a crowd of volunteers in the audience?  Ridiculous.    And that brings us to the identical twin that made the original transported man trick possible...  Are we to believe that the wife and the daughter could not tell these two apart?  Have you ever dated an identical twin?  I have and I could quickly tell one from one another.  So that aspect of the story is completely dumb.  Also, are you telling me that the guy's wife would not even know he had an identical twin?  Did a high schooler write this story?  If the plot and twists are hard to follow (as one reviewer writes) it's because they don't make a darn bit of sense if you take a moment to consider what you've just seen.    Again, well acted, beautiful imagery and costumes, it's well directed, and the story COULD have been good except the screen play writers didn't really think through the scenarios.   This is a great movie picture wise, set-wise, and acting, IF you don't want to spend any time thinking about it 
 After playing Doom 3 (the PC video game), I had high hopes for this movie. Oh well. The movie was disappointing. Were their monsters? Yup. Blood and guts? Yup. Swearing? Yup. Guns and special effects? Yup. But after playing the PC video game, the movie lacked a lot on storyline. And it didn't make me jump as much as the game. The movie is dark, but that's okay, since it was patterned after the video game, which is also dark (although the game was much more "playable"...with darkness...than the movie was "watchable"). The game was scarier too. This says a lot about the game creators (very well done), and the movie directors (poor effort). I'm not sure why Hollywood couldn't hack it. It might be okay as a rental (especially if you haven't played the game), but don't buy it. Honestly, the movie turned-out to be just another alien movie.  However, the game tells a very different story.. 
 I brought this for my niece.She loves dogs so I thought she would like taking care of this virtual doggie.While it's easy to feed and brush the dog.You have to press the charms into the side slots hard.Plus if you lose the charms you can no longer do these actions.As for the games to play.You need to go to a website to find out about them and what they are.If you don't have a computer your out of luck.The graphics are small and fuzzy.I would not recommend this toy 
 I admit that I am not qualified to "judge" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO "stupid." I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.  This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has "got it" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.   FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.  Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.  If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.   I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 After reading Under the Boardwalk I ordered this book and was very excited to read it. However, this book disappointed greatly. There was no character development, especially in the relationship between Zoe and Ryan. Phillips stated exactly what the character's emotions and feelings were, leaving no room for your own insight and feel for the characters. As an avid chick-lit reader, this was one of the worst books I have read in a long time. 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 I purchased this book for instruction on new pond construction.  The text was somewhat informative, but the pictures were a joke. They show pond construction using steam shovels!  I sent my copy back 
 I had my unit for 1 month before experiencing the "F61" many people have seen. I calling their repair shop back and forth during a period of 4 months and it seems that none of the parts that Panasonic sent them could fix the unit.  To this date, I still can't get Panasonic to send me a refurbished unit.  On top of that, I had to drive the unit 97 miles to the nearest repair shop.  I would not recommend this product due to the terrible customer service when it comes to servicing the warranty 
 This is the story of Sheriff Bell, an insufferable dullard who won't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil (as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up?).   He's also a world-class boaster, never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife Loretta is. The same Loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals -- which tells me all I need to know about that marriage.  The yakkity-yakking doesn't stop there. An even bigger gas-bag is Chigurh, the motor-mouthed murderer. In fact, he kills people twice. Before he shoots 'em, he bores 'em to death. His weapon of choice: Lectures about coins. (His final kill took so long, I had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage.)  On the technical front, McCarthy does not structure the drama in the Classical way. He chose the Boring way. The majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character (Moss) has a believable goal. McCarthy also omits the obligatory final scene, between Chigurh and his prey Moss, which was the only reason I kept reading the book. No doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader. Expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story, in my case.   What's more, Sheriff Bell has no scenes with either Chigurh or Moss, making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action. Because McCarthy writes good, visual dialogue, he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story. But when the man on the run (Moss) exits the story, there is no other character to invest in, so the plot grinds to a halt. McCarthy cannot resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players.  So, does McCarthy put us out of our misery? No. Sheriff Bell waffles on for pages and pages about Vietnam, not unlike John Goodman's character Walter in the Big Lebowski. And that's it.  My verdict: I hope Loretta runs away with a criminal. Preferably one of them new evil ones 
 Although I believe this book helps enlighten one to the reality that our soul and deepest longings as women are interconnected with the Creator and His passionate love for us...MUCH of it's "theology" is flawed.  I felt an appeal to self exaltation and a humanizing of God that is clearly anti-biblical.  I would guide any of my fellow Christian readers to remember that all false doctrine is effective because it is dressed up in truth....but it's heart message is false and usually self exhorting.  
 Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?   
 I bought this book to accompany me on a long trip, and wished I hadn't. The stories are very similar to each other, with platitudes of the 'my eyes met with the old woman in the rice paddy, and something wordless was exchanged' variety. I know there are better examples out there: why couldn't the editor find them 
 I installed this machine on a home office network via Ethernet.  The install took awhile, and changed registry settings without asking.  Uninstall did NOT restore the system to it's original state; only hours of manual resetting did that.  How many users can restore the registry?  Further, the software/drivers do not like the printer turned off or missing.  If you install this on a road laptop, you can expect a program, HPZinw12.exe, to search for the missing printer every 100 seconds or so using all available CPU time.  If you are unlucky enough to be in the middle of a client presentation, the chances are good that you have just lost the job.  If you turn off the printer in the office, your office systems will also search for the printer and display an unclosable dialog asking you to switch to an unknown program while using most of their available CPU time. (Please note that 6 hidden dlls are also running at all times.)  This software is totally equivalent to a virus except for duplication.  I returned this system and will never buy another HP product 
 This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim's parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book.  The "mystery" though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn't have murdered him on the spot.  And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim's true nature.  There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward.  Exasperating and annoying. 
 To be short and to the point... the title basically covers the primary issue I had with the book... I felt most of the book could be summed up in about 20 pages but yet it was still a full book of how to go get a free piece of software, connect a GPS, and chart where you were going...  Note: I was most likely disappointed because I was truly looking for a much more technical discussion on how GPS databases work and how to decode GIS information.  In the past when I have prucased books form the publisher they were much more in depth on technical aspects of the systems, data, and so forth.  In this case it was a discussion of how to sue free software and a GPS... no truly what I had in mind.  Oh, well... other I'm sure will enjoy it... just didn't fill the bill for me...  
 I don't like to brag, but I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good judge of movies and whether they're good or not.  I wasn't expecting a blockbuster of a movie, or anything, but MY GOODNESS, this movie was awful!  One could ask themselves, "What's wrong with this movie?" But the answer itself is the very broad question, "What isn't?" Ashley Judd plays strong, sexy women very well, but she does NOT convince me when she plays a character whom is heart-broken and borderline desperate. Not only is Judd's character not believable, the actual plot pertaining to men behaving like cows who need many "places" to plant their seeds is just stupid. There are about a million and a half romantic comedies that are better than this, and I recommend all of them wholeheartedly over this joke of a film. Watch A Walk to Remember instead. Although not the best movie ever, it's a heck of alot better than this drivel 
 This novel reads more like an outline with big holes in both the character development and the plot.  Unlike the professional reviews, I didn't mind the excerpts that were the foundation of the historical quest - what bothered me were the characters themselves.  I found their behavior to be at times bizarre and had a hard time liking any of them.  The situations and the characters' reactions were far-fetched with no surrounding build-up of detail to back up the plot.  I give this 2 stars for originality and 0 stars for detail and character development 
 I received my sunglasses last week, they are increibles but they arrived in deficient conditions. they have three lines on them, and simply I feel that I lost my money.  I think that you should pay attention to the way eyeglasses are packed for transportatio 
 Too complicated to understand. Poor layout of the book. The way information is presented needs to improve a lot 
 In this book, Robert Kaplan makes a case for a revival of Fascism. As in the 1930s, the world is to turn its back on normal morality in favor of the ends justify any means and to adopt National Darwinism. The book idolizes the strongman leader and the arbitrary use of military force unconstrained by a civil society.  He laughs at Jewish and Christian concepts of morality. They are for fools and children. The ethos he reaches for calling it "Pagan" is in truth not that at all. Rather than presenting anything about leadership, he presents domination. Morality is for idiots and all true leaders are supposed to recognize that life (and government) is nothing more than a struggle between men for greatness and survival. To be moral is to be a fool that will be crushed by the real leaders of the world.  Kaplan would have been right at home in Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy or up on the platform with Franco. The book isn't worth reading and I would not recommend it to anyone 
 Why would people spend their lives obsessing over issues for which there is no objective evidence?  A cursory review of the literature about the mind will reveal that dreams are random and without predictive or any other kind of meaning.  Certainly dreams can be about stressful situations in one's life, but they will be mixed with all sorts of extraneous things, people and events that have no significance...viewed properly, they can provide good light entertainment.    Simply put, during consciousness the mind has an inhibition system that is activated so that cognition can proceed in an orderly fashion.  During sleep this system is shut off and all bets are off.  That's all there is to it!  I am tempted to give this book a 1, but will give it a 2 because I don't think she's trying to be deceitful.  For current info, see July '05 issue of the mag, "Scientific American Mind. 
 Another money making scheme dreamed up by the marketing department.  This is not how D&D is supposed to be played 
 Im not from USA. My brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working!! It has serious conection problems in the body that I cant fix in my country. I lost 1000 US 
 While this book is very well written & has a plot that holds together well, I was very disappointed in its content as contrasted with what I anticipated based upon the jacket description. While I know you cannot judge a book by its cover, I was surprised to find this book was a tragedy of monumental proportions. As a sensitive person, it left me depressed in the extreme. In the end, the heroine is left with nothing and no one (except a maid), but her revelation about God's "love" ("his/her" love??? - how can that be when there is so much hopelessness & suffering!) is supposed to be enough to sustain her through the rest of her old age & life. The poor illuminator Finn gets a granddaughter, but he is such a broken man at the end that I didn't believe he would be around to raise her for very long. And Kathryn finding comfort in God after all the horrors of medieval society just seems repulsive to me. I believe jacket descriptions are getting way out of line lately, as this book was nothing more than a RELIGIOUS (RAH! RAH!)tome, cloaked in a medieval setting w/ romantic cover art. You better like religion & the teachings of God if you are thinking about reading this book. I didn't enjoy it, as there was nothing much to enjoy except the writing, since the plot was nothing short of a confirmation of the hopelessness & joylessness of much of human existence. (Thought the way the characters spoke seemed way too modern, inconsisent, & somewhat cheesy for my tastes too!). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they were searching for God's love & were already true believers in the wonderousness of religion 
 This photo is very misleading.  The table legs are gold with stripes of black and what is described as slate top is black tile.  The photo showes the tables very light with a light slate but that is not the case with the product we received.  
 This is o.k. if you're using it as a restraint only.  If you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart, forget it.  I thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars, wrong.  It hardly covers anything.  I went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything, I wish I would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat 
 Don't buy it ! No rhythm, no swing, mumbled , hard to follow lyrics. A major disappointment 
 Fortunately I only paid a few pound for this book at a book fair. I have been successfully day trading for over 5 years, have read in excess of 60 books. This is the worst I have seen. Oliver Velez should be taking out the backyard and horse whipped 
 This book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are. For one, I don't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water, which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists. The author also doesn't mention the importance of live rock. In fact, he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks! Sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Also, I don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. One more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep! If you have enough movement of water at the surface, you should get sufficient gas exchange. There is, however, one thing the book does get right: its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer.  This book is easy to understand, but you won't be getting the best information 
 "The Future of War" predicts US dominance of warfare throughout the 21st Century, as a result of US advanced technology in general and precision weaponry in particular. Their train of thought has considerable merit, and deserves reading and thoughtful attention. However, the book suffers from the same two major flaws as most books by visionaries without enough practical experience: misunderstanding of specific happenings in the past, and unlikely projections into the far future. Having been involved with US defense for 50 years, as a member of the military, as a designer and developer and advisor on US weaponry, and as an advisor on strategic, operational and tactical issues, I read this book with considerable amusement, although I do take seriously much of what it says. I shall give specifics on two failures to understand the details of the past, and then offer criticism of two of the book's projections, as examples.  Past episode #1: The 1991 precision strikes against Iraq. There is no doubt that our air strikes and land attacks in the 1991 campaign to liberate Kuwait were exceedingly effective, and there is no doubt that this effectiveness was largely due to our precision weaponry. However, to do precision strikes, whether with airborne munitions or ground forces, it's necessary to know what targets to attack, where they are, and what weapons are likely to be effective against a particular target. In the 1991 campaign, this effort was undertaken by the "Jeddi Knights", largely under the guidance of Col. John Warden. The key role of the "Jeddi Knights" was to establish priorities and mission profiles for which targets to strike when with what munitions, and they did this extraordinarily well. What the Friedmans obviously don't know is the amount of detailed information that was available to the "Jeddi Knights", carefully acquired over the 70 years preceding the campaign, first by the British until about 1950, and thereafter by the US military. The armed forces of major powers assume they may have to fight wars on short notice aganst opponents who have been designated shortly before by national authorities, so they invest a great deal in gathering information pertinent to how various campaigns might be conducted. In the case of Iraq, the British did very careful mapping from 1920 until about 1950, producing "ordnance" maps of higher detail and accuracy than exist even for some parts of the United States, and these were invaluable to planners. Then, starting in about 1950, when it began to seem possible that the US might someday have to fight somewhere in the Middle East, the US military carefully gathered information relevant to how a campaign might be fought, and which potential enemy targets should be candidates for destruction. These studies resided in US intelligence and military archives until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and were then used as the basis for planning the campaign.  Two examples of this. First, the destruction of certain bridges was given high priority not to impede vehicular movement, but to sever the communications cables running under the bridges; our planners knew which cables important to Iraqi Command and Control were buried too deeply to destroy easily except where they were routed under bridges, and therefore which bridges to take out to disrupt Iraqi military communications. Second, the swing by US, British and French forces far to the West, the "Hail Mary" gambit, would not have been possible in that harsh terrain unless viable routes for armor and supply vehicles were known, and the Iraqi Army either didn't know of such routes or didn't believe we could know of them. There are exactly two feasible routes, and both were used; they can both be determined in complete detail from careful study of the British Ordnance maps prepared in the 1930s, and (although I wasn't involved in the campaign planning) I had no difficulty in finding and plotting the only two feasible routes before the ground campaign began, from the good maps in my possession. I also understand why it was necessary to bring the two prototype JSTARS systems to the theatre, to detect and allow blocking of any Iraqi strike intended to sever the Tapline Road; this was also evident from the maps.  By contrast, we had no success at all in locating and destroying mobile Scud missile launchers, because they moved around with great frequency. If you don't know where something is, no precision of your weaponry, and no amount of technical sophistication or military skill, will allow you to destroy it.  Past example #2: The SAFEGUARD BMD system. The Friedmans say, on the basis of assertions by people who may or may not be experts, that SAFEGUARD was deactivated because it wouldn't work. In fact the situation was exactly the reverse, but one must know the purpose of SAFEGUARD and its mode of operation to understand what actually happened. The mission of SAFEGUARD was to prevent complete success of a Soviet counterforce first strike against our Minuteman ICBM fields, by opening a "launch window" for a retaliatory strike by the Minuteman missiles in the face of a full-scale Soviet strike. I helped to plan and design that system, and it would have done what it was intended to, although at a horrible increased toll of death and destruction, which I dreaded, but could see no alternative to in the face of rapidly increasing Soviet capability. Far more important than the fact that we knew SAFEGUARD would work was the fact that the Soviets concluded it would work; that realization brought them back to the bargainng table at the Helsinki talks, and led to the SALT I treaty, which I rejoiced about. Provisions of that treaty made SAFEGUARD unnecessary, and that's why the one completed SAFEGUARD site was deactivated and construction on the other sites was stopped.  Also on the subject of balistic missile defense, the Friedmans assert that midcourse discrimination and destruction of incoming warheads is infeasible. This is simply not true, although there is an exceedingly serious problem associated with doing it. I know three quite different ways of doing midcourse discrimintion and destruction of enemy incoming warheads, and, given that I've been out of that business for more than 10 years, I expect that other ways are known by now. The problem is that, at least for the three ways I know, one is politically unacceptable to the US Congress and the US public, one is so expensive that it's unlikely Congress would ever fund it, and the third, if fully developed, would be usable for certain other military purposes that would probably lead to a renewed arms race as our potential major opponents sought to counter it. (I was one of a small group of scientists who successfully recommended to Congress that development of that third approach be stopped, to avoid the resulting foreseeable escalation; scientists and military professionals, despite various comments in the Friedmans' book, work closely together over years and decades, and come to have considerable knowledge of each other's fields.) Whether at some future time it may become desirable to develop and deploy a BMD system that does midcourse discrimination and destruction of warheads is a political and diplomatic question to be decided by the public and its elected leaders, on which I have no insight, but it is technically feasible.  Now, turning to the future, what the Friedmans fail to understand in their glowing vision of US technology dominating future warfare, is that for every technical advance, opponents can devise at least partial countermeasures, and that therefore no amount of technology as such can determine the outcome of a campaign. The Coalition conquest of Iraq in 2003 provides an excellent example. Although large parts of the Iraqi army, and all of its top leadership, was utterly incompetent, other large parts of the Iraqi army were composed of thoroughly trained officers and enlisted men, who fully understood that if they confronted US forces nose to nose, they would be destroyed. Understanding this, very many of the best Iraqi units simply demobilized themsleves and disappeared into the civilian population as Coalition forces approached, in many cases taking their weaponry with them. One entire Iraqi division near the border with Iran totally vanished before we got to its bases; everyone from the division commander to the most junior private. Professional soldiers, even if motivated to fight, have no more desire than anyone else to be killed pointlessly in a situation where they are unable to resist effectively.  A substantial fraction of these well-trained, motivated Iraqi forces subsequently emerged as part of the resistance movement that continues in Iraq. How many of the resistance fighters come from that crowd is obviously impossible to know for sure, but my personal estimate is that about 30,000 of Saddam Hussein's best and most loyal troops and officers became part of the resistance movement. And our overwhelming superiority in all aspects of conventional warfare have been far less effective against current Iraqi resistance methods; the resistance movement seems to be gradually weakening and fragmenting, but it's a long slow process, in which our precision weapons and our advanced communications and intelligence give us far less of an advantage than they do in conventional warfare.  There are various other gaps in the Friedmans' assessment of the future. I'll mention only two of many. First, vircators, often touted as the most effective weapon of the 21st Century, have had only relatively diappointing results so far. Why? Partly because technical improvements to vircators are needed; those will surely come along in due course. Much more serious is the fact that battle damage asssessment after a vircator strike is at present almost impossible to do with any degree of accuracy, so after a target has been attacked with one or more vircators, there is no practical way to know whether the strike was successful or not. Presumably some day we will overcome this particular problem, but it illustrates that new and potentially formidable technology may find relatively little application because of purely tactical and operational problems that arise in using it.  As my second example, I'll remark on the Friedmans' vision of US infantrymen as being in effect "cocooned" in future to protect them from the enemy's weapons. This vision ignores two serious problems. First, no "cocoon" imaginable can protect an infantryman against certain weapons such as a fuel-air bomb if the enemy knows approximately where the infantryman is. Second, and closely related, anyone with substantial experience in concealing himself in a hostile environment, including me, knows all too well that the more accoutrements one has, the harder it is to hide and not be observed. In light clothing and carrying only light personal weapons, I can disappear into the landscape almost anywhere, and move around unnoticed; burdened with excess equipment and elaborate protective clothing, only certain carefully selected spots can offer concealment. Everyone with experience in this matter knows as much as I do on this subject, so infantrymen whose lives depend on not being observed will move far more cautiously when heavily burdened than when lightly armed and lightly protected. That doesn't mean infantry should be sent into combat inadequately equipped, but it does mean that the increased effectiveness of some given number of trained infantry when provided with extra combat capability and protective equipment is far less than one might otherwise suppose.  I could cite dozens of other matters, past and projected, which the Friedmans book misunderstands or overlook, but this is enough. I'll just say that the book is an excellent source of ideas, but should be viewed with practiced skepticism 
 I purchased this watch as a birthday present for my husband.  When he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both Spanish and English, and there doesn't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other, since there were limited instructions with the watch.  By the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund. Not happ 
 Camera is easy to set up.  Video is of acceptable quality, but  Sound quality is good.  However, I cannot utilize the microphone and sound monitoring feature from my office because my employer only allows http to get through the network.  I'd highly recommend this camera.  However, it just stopped panning after about 13 months of very light use.  That is, tilting up/down is still working but panning left/right does not.  Support is terrible because I could hardly understand the English spoken by tech support.  Further, tech support couldn't help figure out what is wrong.  It seems that it will have to be sent in for repair and it will cost pretty pennies. 
 Beautifully illustrated book and perfect for dumbing down your child. Imagine silly Elmo, role model, talking about bedtime. Elmo has little to offer in this book. My daughter isn't allowed to and doesn't come up with 100 things she must do before going to bed. Why let Elmo teach her to stall or manipulate? If I read this book to her, she may need to check under the bed, water the plants, open the window and look outside, feed the fish, run out of the room to check to see if the water was left running, check to make sure the cap is on the toothpaste, close the window, et cetera before going to bed.  I have a collection of now over 300 children's books and this one just doesn't offer much. There are so many better books out there--many classics which are engaging and silly, but ALSO teach kids lessons on HOW TO LIVE AND ACT.  Often both parents are working these days and there is less time that they are around to teach their children about morality and how to live. Why waste time with this book? Even that purple dinosaur has more to offer 
 This movie had a lot of potential.  I did not even mind the changes in the movie from the stage production.  BUT, any one with any singing experience knows that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sings these songs without opening your mouth!  The leads are all running around singing intense songs with their mouths open a crack.  I could not enjoy this movie at all because I knew they were lip syncing.  If something like this bothers you, I would avoid this movie.  The acting definitely falls flat. 
 All these reviews are right on the MONEY!! IT GETS TOOOO HOT!! I bought this crock-pot to replace my old Rival crock-pot that is the same size because I liked the idea of the timer and keep-warm setting. I have used it 3 times and it has over cooked all three meals! I put a beef stew in it today on LOW at 9:00AM and by noon the potatoes were mushy and falling apart and it was BOILING, I hate to think what it would have been like if I let it cook for the recommended 8 - 10 hours! GOOD THING I WAS HOME TODAY! I had also bought my daughter one for Christmas, because of her busy schedule sometimes she does not get home in time to turn her crock-pot off and thought the KEEP WARM setting would be GREAT for her. But I just called her and she told me she tried cooking a roast in it this week and it come out burnt and she only cooked it on LOW for six hours!! I rated this one star because the website would not let me rate it ZERO 
 I am disappointed with this cookbook. I was looking for a basic cookbook to explain times and techniques to cook standard items in a Toaster Oven. What I call the "Nitty Gritty" of using a Toaster Oven. Obviously I am wrong, the book contains nothing basic, standard or instructional about using a toaster oven 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 I often read reviews of books that I am considering for purchase.  I read "A Brother's Journey" and found it to be a better read, that kept my interest and that had some good writing.  With this book, "A Teenager's Journey" I was somewhat disappointed.  Since I depend so often on others reviews of books, I am beginning to think that I need to take the time to review what I have purchased.  Again, I sympathize with both Richard and David, but this book did not make me feel strong emotions that made me want to turn page after page to see what would happen next 
 Table came with chipped wood on one leg. When put together, the chip got even worse. The table is horribly unsteady. Would not recommend to anyone. 
 This film is a bunch of disjointed skits. Thy try too hard to be campy; however with not enough lead and no finish each disjointed sketch just leaves you wanting. There are a few made-up ersatz songs and Jayne Mansfield's accoutrements; aside from those everything else is flat.  There are a few personalities but they never shine: Phyllis Diller (fully clothed) Brian Donlevy (storms the beach) Jayne Mansfield (always points north) The Wild Ones (People Sure Act Strange)  The introductory song was the best part of the film.   A final thought "Love is a rose, but you better not pick it" 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 Compared to the DVD Movie, this cd is a complete misrepesentation of the Movie, the sound tracks were not in the movie.  On a scale of 1 to 5 stars I give it a minus 2 
 This device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity.  One must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal.  Nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse, as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding.  At best, this device MIGHT manage to acurately read a pulse AFTER a strenuous activity is concluded 
 Albert Hourani's A History of the Arab Peoples is a widely regarded general history of the Arab world. This is too bad, since as history the book is of low quality, with significant problems of organization and, where relevant to Hourani's apparent biases, factual accuracy. It does have its redeeming elements, but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the Arab world, especially for the beginner.  Being the author of a general history of the Arab world myself, before I explain why I evaluate the book negatively I would like to suggest some alternatives, lest I be accused of attacking a rival publication out of self-interest. Philip K. Hitti's The History of the Arabs is a very detailed history which runs from pre-Islamic times to the 19th century. Arthur Goldschmidt's Concise History of the Middle East covers Turkey, Iran and Israel as well as the Arab world and is well-organized for beginners. It was the first general history of the Middle East I read as an undergraduate. Bernard Lewis' The Middle East focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region.  This book was first published in 1991. This review is based on the 1992 paperback version by Warner Books.  The initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter; although containing 458 pages of main text, Hourani's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-Islamic period. This is pretty amazing, for anyone familiar with that period, since Arab history prior to Islam is roughly as long as Arab history after it. Exactly how far back Arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute, but certainly there were people one could call "Arabians" as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium BC, or 1,600 years prior to Muhammad. The evidence is sporadic for sure, and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times, but seven pages is pretty paltry.  One might suspect an Islamic bias here, but the problem continues in the key early periods of Islam. The life of Muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the Muslim world, spanning about a half century from Muhammad's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor Ali, get only 11 pages. The first Arab empire, the Umayyads (661-950), gets seven pages, and the Abbasid Empire (750-circa. 945), which is usually thought of as the "Golden Age of Islam," gets only six. This means 37 pages for the first 2,000 years of Arab history, including its framing epoch, and over 400 pages for the next 1,000. This would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion.  What makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization. The middle time period between the collapse of Abbasid authority - roughly AD 950 - and the ascendance of the Ottoman Empire over the Arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history. This is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states, there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of Sunni and Shia, Arab, Persian and Turkic ruling groups, not to mention the Latin states. Hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one. There are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods (the Umayyads and the Abbasids). There is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time. If you want to understand the relative historical roles of the Buyids, the Fatimids, the Zengids, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks and their contemporaries, read something else.  It is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its "social history," or its description of the development of the Arab world. In fact I cited Hourani on the social history sections of my own book. In this regard, Hourani really is better than the alternatives. Over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the Arab world came to be prior to the Ottomans. So for those who have already read a general history of the Middle East or the Arab world and want a more specialized knowledge, these chapters are quite useful.  I have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest. This book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of Arabs and Muslims, to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the Arab world which might be interpreted negatively. The word "jihad" doesn't even have an entry in the index, although it is used, or perhaps, misused. On page 247, Hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation "to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom's defense..." This gives a misimpression, because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of Muslim lands and the Muslim community's collective obligation to spread Islam through conquest. Although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application, its use is overwhelmingly in the military context, and while Muhammad's battles probably could be described as defensive, the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations (the Christian counter-offensives known as the Crusades being a major exception).  More broadly, the single most influential Islamist movement of the modern age, the Wahhabis, get only a few scattered mentions, and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time. The primary non-Islamist ideological influence, Marxism, is discussed of course, but the influence of Nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out. Nazi Germany is mentioned once in passing, and in the same paragraph on page 331 Palestinian leader Amin Husseini is mentioned, but it isn't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of Nazis, that he moved to Germany during the Second World War and played an active role in the Holocaust, or that despite this he was made leader of the Palestinian cause by the nascent Arab League after the war.  Hourani's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate, giving the impression that Egypt engaged in some bluster and then Israel started the war. He mentions Nasser's demand that the UN clear out of the Suez Canal zone, and includes the defense pact with Jordan, but omits a key fact - the mobilization of Egyptian forces in the Sinai. Once Egypt did this, Israel had no choice but to attack, because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization, while Egypt could. Hourani also doesn't mention the statements by Arab leaders to the effect that all Jews would be wiped out in the coming war.  On the whole, this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of Arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern. Otherwise, I do not recommend buying it 
 Good actors pick up their paychecks in a weakly scripted cop show. Plot elements are familiar to anyone who owns a TV. No suspense, zero surprises. Most viewers will find that they are better detectives than the characters on screen. 
 I have not finished this book yet but so far I think this woman is a nut. Referring to grocery store shelves as morgues for "dead" food. That's just stupid and weird. No cooked food? None? Forget it, lady. She has some good ideas but they are taken to the extreme 
 The monitor works really well. The functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking.   If you are looking for a good basic monitor, this is a great unit. 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 Beyond Duality was a very disappointing book for me, primarily because to me it seemed that the title itself was very misleading.  I should have looked more closely at the cover photo, which expressed the actual content  of the book far more eloquently, more closely.  It depicts a fairly  disenchanted looking woman and man on the cover, each eyeing the other with  apparent non-comphrehension. Which is exactly what this book is about -  rather than going *beyond* duality,it seems to embrace it.  It is my  understanding that to truly evolve we need to confront and transcend  concepts as male, female, top, bottom, and instead realize that there are  simply people with different traits, needs, and personalities.  This book  is too quick to fall back into excuses and cliches that sound more like  metaphysical rhetoric for "it's a _______thing." The other  exercises fall more into a just too obvious kind of catagory.  Of course  stairways go both up and down, and neither is better than the other (an  actual example from the book.) I didn't find this insightful or useful. I  suppose my disappointment in Beyond Duality stems from the fact that I  expected transcendent, groundbreaking metaphysical ideas, and I got pop  psychology of the "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"  variety, and that was just the kind of outdated thinking I was trying to  avoid.  I prefer not  to give negative reviews, but I also believe that  people should have the opportunity to go into a book with a better  knowledge of what they're getting.  I hope this helps someone 
 This was bought for my daughter and the quality is absolutely horrible.  Talk about lowering your product standards to hit a price level.  The images on the box of the lit up crayons, dry erase markers, and the tracing piece are computer generated images.  If they showed true images, nobody would buy this.  
 I have a few concerns with the words Willie Jolley writes and speaks.  Never quote the bible then talk about going out and doing all you can to make more money. Do you really believe Jesus condones the desire to gain "worldly" things Willie? You talked the entire time about your riches and have the nerve to quote proverbs...   I have a little tip for you Willie, when you write or speak, don't use Microsoft  / Bill Gates as examples of success. You do know that they were found guilty in a court of law numerous times of illegal practices to get where they are right? They lie, steal, and cheat to get ahead.  Will you be endorsing Martha Stewart and Enron next? Maybe use Tyco or Halliburton as an example of how to succeed and make loads of money.  I have a little tip for you too Willie, maybe a little something you can throw in your speeches or possibly your next book: Tell the people you talk to, that no matter how much money they get, that in life, happiness is what really counts. Just, do something everyday that makes you smile. You don't have to brainwash yourself by repeating affirmations of "I am happy" 800 times a day. You don't have to force yourself to be a type-a personality. You don't have to climb the corporate ladder of achievement to have a wonderful fulfilling life. No Willie, all you need is to accept you for who you are, and strive to be happy. I smile everyday. I don't have to brainwash myself to get there.  You're either the bee or the windshield? Too bad life isn't so black and white as to only be reduced to such.  I say, seek out the fields of flowers and avoid the highway altogether.  
 This book is for the beginner and offers no information that cannot be found (for free) on other internet sites. It appears as if the author has written this book to make his methodology clearer to himself and in the process decided to sell it as a book. No earth shattering revelations to be found and definately not enough good quality examples.   A bit disappointed in the content but this book will be a good read for an absolute newbie in the field.  
 I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't.  The setting and the culture is very exotic but the story itself is very weak and uninteresting.  The characters are all one-dimensional and their motivations are not explored; it is hard to care about them or to feel that you are really a part of their world.  The plot moves very, very slowly and it is easy to get bogged down and bored in the endless narration.  The Arabic names are pretty but are hard to keep straight, especially when very few characters have any defining attributes that will help a reader remember them.  I can't recommend it 
  Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years.   I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: "North & South", "Pride & Prejudice"-1940, & 1996 & 2006, "Wives and Daughters", and "A Walk to Remember". Adventure with romance: "The Scarlet Pimpernel". 
 Perhaps English majors will enjoy this book, but I didn't. The author constantly draws parallels between encryption and totally unrelated literature. Treating foreign languages or the Bible as a type of  cryptography is going too far. If you're a Poe fan, this book is for you,  but if you'd rather learn something about cryptography, find another book 
 The book is an easy read but the connnections that the author makes are very tennuous.  He talks about coincidences in life but the stories he writes about are vague and far-fetched.  The style of writing is not all that creative so the book does not offer very much 
 I was very excited to start feeding my son solids.  I bought this book and Super Baby Food.  This book is NO comparison to the Super Baby Food book.  This book would be a great 3rd or 4th addition to your baby food cookbooks but not a very good starter book.  It doesn't explain anything in detail.  Compared to the Super Baby Food Book this book is awful.  If you want detail and direction for feeding your baby, this is not the book to buy 
 The Motely Fool has never shied away from congratulating itself, in an entertaining sort of way.  The trouble comes in when the reality fails to live up to the authors' claims.  Their style of rah-rah anyone-can-make-a-million investing appeals to some novice investors for obvious reasons.  But as Malkiel points out in the classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street, there will always be a few people who have a fortunate run for a few years.  Today, sadly, after the crash of 2000, the Gardners' conclusions in Rule Breakers Rule Makers seem to be more misleading than helpful, especially for someone just starting out.  If investing were only as easy as the Gardners make out then their own "Rule Breaking" portfolio might have continued to work.  They have tried to selectively cite certain of their more recent portfolios to make it appear that they're continuing to "beat the market like a drum", while sweeping under the rug their losing portfolios.  But as the reality of their results stands, they ought to be ashamed of themselves for hyping up stocks and making themselves sound like the next Warren Buffett.    There will always be people on Wall Street like the Gardners, inflating expectations and temporarily taking in some newcomers.  In contrast, real investors like Buffett and Graham are modest about their results.  They stick to a realistic expectation of returns, and realize that today's hot stock is often tomorrow's set of crashed dreams.  A beginning investor would be much better served reading Graham's The Intelligent Investor, or another classic of the Street, rather than being drawn into a charming but unrealistic look at the high hopes of what are ultimately mere self-promoters 
 I'm a language teacher and I have a number of DVDs that I use at school as language tools.  DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English.  Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD.  I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  I suppose it's my fault for assuming, but I feel ripped off just the same 
 I haven't read the book but I am about to buy it so this isn't a review it's just a comment on the other reviews.  I don't know exactly how the writing linked Taoism and Ninjutsu as I haven't read the book. I just wanted to say this isn't the first time I have heard of this.   It was in one of either of these two books I can't remember which (I would bet on the first):  Mind Manipulation The Ninja - Steven Hayes  They discuss the development of alot of the psychoogical aspects from the Taoist 5 elements and there was a reference to some "5 element ninjas." There was even a Japanese word for them.  I remember this clearly coz at the time I was doing XIng Yi Luihe a Taoist art with the 5 elements at its heart. Also the 5 element ninja idea sounded cool.  I am not concluding anything...just offering a bit of info in passing.  PS. My rating was just to try and not mess up the rating by others. 
 Not up to Adair's usual standard. I don't mind if a book in this genre has an unlikely plot, but it annoys me when it is full of holes. The heroine is pathetic and not very smart. The writing is not witty or suspenseful and I ended up flipping through the pages 
 Leaving aside the problems many have cited with historical accuracy, Robin Maxwell's writing itself is cloying, mannered, and embarrassing.  Were Elizabeth I and Anne Boleyn merely characters, the story would still be weak, thanks to its delivery via throbbingly purple prose.  Maxwell is not confident with the language she's chosen to use.  It manages to be uncomfortably antique-sounding to untrained modern ears, yet it is anachronistic to the period it is supposed to reflect.  It satisfies neither as a modern retelling, nor as period-faithful.  Ms. Maxwell seems to be aware of this - and the result is that she does not have the confidence to pull off her idiom confidently.  As to historical accuracy:  for those who care enough to know better than books like this are able to portray, no setting-straight of the record is necessary.  For those who don't, it would be beside the point.  Stay away from this author only because her writing is weak; not because her research methods are inferior to your historical knowledge 
 What a lousy battery.Used it on my clock and it leaked.I would never use it again. .. 
 Well, my gosh, what a waste of time, U2 really should give it up and just go away and stop plagaraising everything with their marketing money making schemes (u2.com members, ticket prices.)  I won't go on and on about U2 being sold out, where it all went wrong, all I know is that U2 are getting by and panicked when Popmart was'nt well recieved, mainly because they were silly enough not to finish the record and get a tour booked ahead of it.  So the DVD... boring whats wrong with it  1. Crap editing, as others have mentioned 2. The band look bored 3. Bono looks like fat Elvis 4. Bono can't sing anymore 5. Was it really neccesary to have a camera in Bonos sunglasses? 6. Extras??? Two thirty second clips of Zoo TV and Popmart both of which they have'nt released on DVD and both of which are impossible to buy as VHS is extinct now. (Despite being their best live shows supporting two of their greatest albums.) 7. The credits are listed as a extra feature. 8. Plagued by material from the overated overhyped and boring album "All that you can't leave behind".   ....has its moments, but at the end of the day its the performance that counts, not the lighting effects and the fancy but pointless and annoying unwatchable!! camera editing.  If you want to have a collection of U2 live before they turned crap and commercialised add "Rattle and Hum" "Actung Baby" "Zoo TV live from Sydney" and "Popmart" VHS's to your collection, thats if you can dig them up from anywhere.  U2 have yet to release a decent DVD, dissapoiting for the biggest band on earth 
 I have bought and returned 1/2 and 1 acre Stinger bug zappers from Costco 4 times now in the past 3 years. Thank God I was buying from Costco as Stinger products are worthless. Light attracts them but zappers don't work. Some worked for a week and others didn't zap at all. I don't know why Costco carries such a terrible product. I kept thinking, maybe these were a bad batch and I will finally get a good product. Not so, do not buy these products 
 The Mysteries of Udolpho is beautifully written.  Ann Radcliffe writes page after page, after page...of picturesque descriptions of Italy and France's countryside.   That being said, I found The Mysteries of Udolpho to be long winded and drawn out.  The first two volumes are rather mind-numbing and I skimmed over much of it.  I never felt a connection towards Emily and felt rather indifferent towards her well being.  I found her to be rather insipid and became tired of her constant fits of weeping and fainting.  Her servant, Annette, was more intriguing than Emily and her pathetic weakness. I would personally recommend skipping The Mysteries of Udolpho to read Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Uncle Silas.  Young Maud finds herself in similiar circumstances but approaches them with not only grace and sweetnss but a strength that she "finds from a place unknown" to herself.  You will cheer for Maud in a way that seems impossible to do for Emily 
 I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that. 
 Very few helpful suggestions in this book. The authors are Pharmacists. They list side effects of herbs that would happen to maybe 1 in a billion people. They state that dandelion can cause, "Skin irritation... blockage of the digestive  or biliary tract, gallbladder inflammation, gallstones" but on the SAME page say that it is used for "digestive complaints, gallbladder problems, to stimulate bile production". Now, why would you use a plant that helps with gallbladder problems if it causes them?? (by the way, it does not, I have much experience with this plant and have never had any side effects, nor has anyone I have spoke with). This book will do nothing but make you paranoid of about using herbs. If you want a good book, get "The New Age Herbalist" or anything by Rosemary Gladstar, Dr. James A. Duke or James Green. Peterson Field guides are also quite good 
 I AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE MY ITEM.  SO I COULDN'T POSSIBLY RATE SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE. EXCEPT TO SAY THAT ITS TAKEN WAY TOO LONG TO RECEIVE 
 Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole "We're married and my husband's a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?  What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.  Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?  Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don't do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!  It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap 
 Saucepan made in Indonesia was extremely lightweight and pan was distorted so that the lid did not fit securely.  There was no way to realign the pan so the lid would fit.  It was in the construction of the pan.  As a long time user of Revere Ware, we were very disappointed in this product sent to us.  We will never purchase another Revere Ware product.  Once burned we will not go back to a second treatment 
 Shaonnon Drake is the nom de plume of Heather Graham.  Both are basically in the "bodice ripper" genre I guess. (Graham is the name for hardcovers and Drake for the paperbacks, it would appear).    This book was so bad I almost stopped at the "Prologe" in which the errors were almost laughable.  The author's vision of WW-II combat seems to have come from watching the final battle in the movie Zulu one too many times.  From there I was able to wade as far a a slice of Chapter 2 where a combination of boredom and lack of interest in the plot overwhelmed me.  I'm glad I just checked this out from the library, because I hate to think I would have spent money for it 
 Richard Bach is the most inspiring writer alive. Or he just was the most inspiring one? The alternative explanation to much of the disappointment that seems to be common to Bach fans after reading his latest book, is a very humane one - not eveything that one does could be a master-piece. If this was his first book, I would say he was a promising author. But after books and books of wonder-ideas, this can at best invoke sympathy for the Richard struggling to reestablish the lost connection with Tink.  At its beginnig, Out of my MInd suggests that the story will elaborate on the factory of ideas story from One (my personal favorite; both the book and this particular episode). However, it appeared that Bach was not able to elaborate on this or any ohter idea.  I am still hopeful the real Richard Bach will be back. However, reading Out of my Mind, the thought of Leslie kept coming back. Bach had an almost spiritual connection to his fans. We believed him, as you believe a teacher and a leader. I still believe in parallel present times, but do not have the courage to reread The Bridge Across Forever. Out of my Mind did not convince me that Bach himself believes in his ideas any more. Leslie is not just just a divorce case... Two stars just because everyone has the right for error 
 I'll begin by saying that I definitely do not recommend this hub. After about 2 months it completely malfunctioned. My pc no longer recognized devices that were connected via the hub. The indicators also stopped illuminating. I replaced it promptly with a D-Link DUB-H7 and have not had any problems. The D-Link has been in service for about 7 months.  I'll end by saying that I definitely do not recommend this hub!!!!  Good luck with your search.. 
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 This is by far one of the worst cds I have ever heard. This singer is terrible and should be shot with a very heavy animal tranquilizer. I never was a big fan of grindcore or hardcore so I guess this isn't my cup of tea at all. The drummer is damn good though. He should start another band and leave these guys to play a half empty venue the rest of their lives with the likes of Blood Has Been Shed, Hatebreed, Bleeding through.Don't buy it because it sucks 
 I'm sorry to say but I just couldn't get through this book. Read about half of it, but I'm not into long meandering descriptions. If you want a plot that will carry you along, this is not the book 
 The author and publisher of this travesty need to spend a little more time in the real world, perhaps in the helping professions and less time in literati land where obviously they thought this tripe was a good idea.  To those who believe this is an accurate commentary on American society, I say to look a little more closely; altruism abounds in our society, it just isn't as sexy or glamorous as the narcissism and the greed and so isn't as easly seen.    Further a comment on the audio version of this book: the reader needs to stop trying to imitate regional accents.  Speaking as someone who actually lives in Maine, very few of us actually talk with an accent and to hear it imitated (badly) in media is insulting 
 This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read 
 I was deeply disappointed in this book.  As a young(ish) woman on a career track who is anticipating also being a mom in the next 2-5 years, I have thought a great deal about what parenthood will mean for my career as well as how my career will impact my child/children.  I heard about this book on MoveOn.org's website.  Since I feel fairly well informed about what America's moms don't have and what they want (from independent sources and friends), I was anticipating more emphasis on the "what to do about it" part.  The book had numerous case studies to pull at the heart strings paired with middling to flimsy statistical data (with several dubiously supported claims repeated multiple times throughout the book).  There was a lot of "what we want" with only a few concrete idea on HOW to implement these things other than the usual extreme liberal bread and circuses approach.  Even the good ideas in the book (e.g., focus on how your employer will benefit from family friendly policies, not on how it will benefit you as the employee) are undermined by the statistical "evidence" that had hole big enough to drive a train through.  I actually feel less confident in building an articulate argument in support of better policies than before I read the book.  I knew before I read the book that there are significant problems with the current American workplace system (both for mothers and beyond).  So I was truly disappointed that so many pages in this short book were dedicated to long winded and often repetitive descriptions of the state of the world.  I want a better world for myself and my family and was hoping for constructive advice for making my world a better place.  This book didn't have it 
 If you're looking for writing that is as clever or as witty as Dean Koontz's, take one pace back away from this book. If you're expecting storyytelling on par with John Grisham, take another step back. If you're hoping for a story loaded with interesting tidbits and facts on par with Dan Brown, take another step back.   This book was unoriginal, boring, predictable, and very cliche. Don't waste your time or your money like I did. 
 What a complete pain! ..... We now use Macs. However, I decided to take the California bar examination July 2006. The California bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by Examsoft. Presently, the software will only work on Windows XP. Moreover, the California bar examiners will not allow any Macs, even the newer Macs with the Intel processors which require complete re-booting into Windows.  As a result, I was forced to upgrade my Gateway laptop, a fine laptop as far as PCs are concerned, in order to sit for this bar examination. (That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.) THANK GOD FOR GATEWAY COMPUTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS THE MICROSOFT FOLKS ARE CLUELESS:  Even though the warranty on my Gateway laptop expired some time ago, Gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than I can possibly discuss here. Conversely, Microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected. .....  I suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software (any new software) will only work with the newer versions of Windows XP or Vista, and since Vista will be such a memory hog, consumers eventually will be forced to dump their PCs which cannot be upgraded, for new PCs.  As for how the operating system actually works: a grade of Fair. YESTERDAY, THE MICROSOFT UPDATE WEBSITE WAS DOWN WHICH, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT'S DISCUSSION WEBSITE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER WINDOW USERS AS WELL. Typical 
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 I agree with the reviewer who felt that Ms. Shires's textual analysis didn't flow well.  I found the majority of this book to be rather dull, tedious, slow-going, and uninvolving.  It was an original idea to tell the story of her conversion by relating issues she had difficulty with or areas she found inspiration in to certain passages of Torah and the similar writings of others, but it just didn't seem executed well.  If this is supposed to be a conversion memoir, why does so little of the book actually concern her conversion or even her herself?  The sections when Ms. Shires is writing about herself, such as in the beginning section, the ending chapter about her visit to her husband's native Germany, and the middle chapter about the mikvah, are quite good and interesting, because they're actually related to her life and to her conversion and not just tediously rambling on about certain Torah passages.  From reading this, it seems as though she were the classic child who does not know enough to ask.  She says she did a lot of reading prior to her conversion because she really wanted to know the religion and to approach it from a variety of disciplines, but in many sections she admits that she didn't know about some pretty important things or issues till after she converted.  For example, she says that she hadn't had a lot of education about the mikveh and had been too embarrassed to ask her converting rabbi, and therefore went into her conversion day feeling she had to immerse herself because she was thought to be "contaminated" and "dirty" as a non-Jew and had to cleanse herself before being admitted to the tribe.  How could anyone in any denomination, particularly if she's had such a long process of education and learning as Ms. Shires evidentally had, reach conversion day thinking such a thing and not having learnt more about the custom of mikveh?  (I was also annoyed that her chapter on the mikveh used the dated and inaccurate translations "contaminated" and "unclean" for the Hebrew words "tumah" and "tamei."  That continues to give the completely false impression that menstruating women are thought to be dirty and unclean, when in actual fact the words surrounding this state of being are translated more like "ritually impure," and the impurity refers to a spiritual, not a physical, state of being.)    I was also left wondering why she converted under the auspices of the Conservative Movement when she so clearly feels ill at ease with many of their official positions, or at least the positions her own community seems to take.  She really seems like she'd feel more at home in a Reform, Reconstructionist, or Renewal community.  I'm also baffled as to why she frequently says that the Conservative Movement hasn't done enough for the inclusion of gays and women, unless her community isn't as liberal as many other Conservative communities are.  Or are the changes of the past few decades not radical and sweeping enough for her?  I also share her belief that women, gays, the disabled, and other groups that traditionally haven't always been included fully in Jewish life need to be completely integrated and granted full equality and participation in the community, but at times her call for this reads more like a political polemic and speaking from personal experience as opposed to really representing the great strides the Conservative Movement has made in these areas in the past few decades.  I'm not doubting her personal experiences with people she's known and what she's dealt with in her own community, but it just seems baffling if she's trying to say the entire Conservative Movement takes those positions as well.  A couple of interesting chapters do not a very recommendable book make.  Most of this was just very slow going for me, and the divrei Torah weren't that novel or insightful either.  I've heard most of these interpretations and analyses before, only not in such dull language.  I'm actually disappointed I bought this book, though at least I got a cheap used copy.  I'd looked forward to reading a conversion memoir, but instead got a tedious exercise in boredom that had almost nothing to do with the author's life, either before, during, or after her conversion 
 While the writing was acceptable, I felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced.  The differnce between the classes is too obvious.  The contrast between the rich world (the students in the Wilcox school and the Cornhills) and the streets of London (and Isa's forced marriage to the grocer, and Mrs. Cornhill's predictable and obvious snobbery) was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice.  I was left cold by the overall plot.  One thing that truly bothered me was the fate of Mr. Cornhill and Isa.  I felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired, and was not in true Bronte style.  The characters and their development also left something to be desired.  They were too predictable at times, and Mr. Ellin was just annoying.  There were few occasions when I sympathized with any character, other than Isa (and only at certain points in the plot). There was nothing spectacular about this novel, though I won't discourage anyone from reading it.  It was fast paced and it did hold my interest.  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Its a good book to draw examples of idustries in different stages of technology evolution. However it is lacking in theoretical content, 
 Damn Yankees was a supergroup containing Ted Nugent,Tommy Shaw(STYX),Jack Blades(Nightranger)and someother guy. All talented musicians, who are best heard in their prespective groups. Damn Yankees just doesn't rock,like it should. I've given it a chance and just can't get into it. A lot of talent involved, just doesn't do anything for me 
 I just don't have much to say about this one.  I have so enjoyed the previous books in this series, but was quite disappointed with this one.  Everything from the story line to the writing style was terrible.  I wanted to read about the ladies that I have grown to love, but this story was about the other residents of Covington with hardly a word about Grace, Hannah and Amelia. The only reason I finished it was because I actually spent money to purchase the book instead of checking it out at the library.  Otherwise, I would have put it down and never picked it up again.  I hope the next book lives up to the quality of the others before this one 
 I was very disappointed in this book. Mostly the mother-daughter team, who own a costume jewelry shop, tells you to buy expensive French brands you already knew about. The book is about half photographs of them wearing classic clothes that don't look particularly French---cream, khaki, navy and other neutrals. Very tasteful, and stylish in a quiet way, but nothing specifically French. Maybe that's the point. Entre Nous by Debra Ollivier was vastly more useful in understanding what makes french woemn seem more stylish. She is an American who lived in Paris for a decade married to a Frenchman 
 Anybody buying this book to learn some BW will be very much disappointed. Like the way the book is organised but older stuff. I can't beleive the greedy publiser is still selling this book. Not only they should stop selling, also should recall the book 
 yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro.  her husband monsoro is not getting any, how would you feel. this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson, don't buy books you don't know, cause they [are bad 
 This book stinks, the plot is trivial, the characters suck, and the chapters go on and on and on and on and on about nothing, nothing at all.   Here is my favorite passage from the book "There was nothing for him to do but roll over and try to sleep.  Somewhere, sometime, he had even forgotten how to cry."  Yeah the entire book is like that.   
 Ice Cycles is a lumbering behemoth rarely breaking stride, slogging it's way without direction.  Platypus is best when they forego the vocals, only then does the band stretch their musical legs and pick up the pace.  Lyrically this album walks the same path brethern Dream Theater has taken, choosing the gothic-anguish-pain-saddness motif, which only adds to heavy footed feel of this CD.  The musicianship of the band gave way for a pop-buzz metal feel.  These guys are capable of much better 
 Disappointing.  Our heroine spends 300 pages convinced her mother (as sane as any wealthy Texas matron) is crazy.  Not believable even in the pretend world.  I was looking forward to this third outing of Ms. Kendricks but had to keep reading faster to not put it down completely.  Surely #4 will be back on track.   
 I disagree with the spotlight reviewer's assertion that this movie-musical was overproduced; it seems more to suffer from Spartan-like efforts in production.  I did enjoy the fact that part of Oz was in an urban setting (i.e., the subway station), but it looked like they didn't even try to clean it up a little.  But enough about the movie, this is the soundtrack...and as I stated above, it's a mess.  This classification mainly rests on the shoulders our "Diva Supreme" Diana Ross.  Stephanie Mills set the bar high, and Miss Ross did not even come CLOSE to that standard.  She was a visible, vocal and emotional failure.  Her renditions of "Be a Lion" and Home" (my favorite two songs} were dreadful--in the latter she even sang incorrect lyrics.  She just does not have the talent or ability to effectively communicate Dorothy's character, let alone sing her songs right.  I would rate this with ZERO stars if it were at all possible.  However, the two stars are earned by the members of the original cast (especially Mabel King) and one addition: Ms. Lena Calhoune Horne.  She was radiant in voice and appearance and brought the level of inspiration and power up a notch as she belted out "Believe in Yourself".  They alone save this movie and album from just being a total misstep.  Yet, we still have Diana Ross here absolutely slaughtering the vocals and pathos of Dorothy, so all-in-all it's just a mess 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I love Uncle Remus, and I love the original writing.  This book is so abridged that it totally loses the character of the stories.  I wanted to give this book away, but didn't want to stick anyone else with it.  My 4-year old likes it because it has big color pictures, and my husband likes it because he has trouble reading the original.  For an abridged version that's easier to read, I highly recommend The Complete Tales by James Pinkney 
 I've got to be honest, I couldn't finish this book.  I couldn't even get through the introduction because I was so angered and offended by two comments: 1) large breasts are an abnormality caused by an overactive pituitary gland and 2) small hands are a malformation.  My reaction to this was to take my overactive pituitary gland and malformed limbs and go find another book to read.  Attacking other women for the genetics that define their body types is NOT what feminism should be about 
 Good cast, adaptation of King Lear. Don't bother unless you are really bored 
 If you are a fan of these great early Partridge Family albums, then you owe it to yourself to buy the 1993 Razor & Tie versions instead. Why? Razor & Tie did not tamper with the sound quality, as a result, Razor & Tie discs sound just like the records you remember. I made the mistake of buying the re-masters thinking they would sound even greater; NOT!  I've heard both versions using top of the line monitor speakers, and these Buddha discs have too much bass added for their own good. They also sound flat, because too much noise reduction was used, thus taking away the sparkle which sounded so good on the Razor & Tie versions. You can still find these Partridge Family albums on Razor & Tie right here on Amazon.   The Partridge Family albums on Razor & Tie were the debut album, Up To Date, Sound Magazine, Shopping Bag and The Christmas album.  
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter .

  Island of the blue dolphin written by Scott O'dell,was a great book. I recomend this book to 5th grade and up, dew to the books hard vocabulary. I like this book because of the exitement, adventures, and drama of karanas life on the island alone.Island of the blue dolphin is for people who like to read about survivle and adventure.I dont think people who only like to read about comedys mysteries shouldent read the book.   Island of the blue dolphinis about a girl who gets stuck on an island by herselfand learns how to survie and has a big adventure on the way. The main charcter of this story is karana. Karanas village was fleeing the island, but her brother forgot his spear and ran back.the ship left ,and karana threw her self out the boat to be with her brother. Shortly after,Karanas brother was killed by wiled dogs.Karana is now on the island alone.   
 GWTW certainly was one-sided in its portrayal of the Old South, and I can see how that could be a deal killer for a lot of readers.  Although I consider GWTW to be one of the greatest pieces of American literature ever written, I was VERY excited by the idea of TWDG.  The idea of building a "back story" around the black characters in Mitchell's novel is BRILLIANT!  So much could be done with this idea to address issues of race and slavery, as well as to broadside a popular piece of American literature through counterpoint.  Unfortunately, this great idea is wasted because Randall is utterly lacking in talent.  The thing that immediately bothered me about TWDG is the extraordinarily poor use of dialect.  One sentence has the main character narrating in perfect grammar with strong vocabulary and then in the next sentence she's all "he do dat" and "me go sleep."  Randall should have picked one voice for her main character and stuck with it.  This alone represents terrible hack writing, but I must go on and say something about the (snicker) "plot."  The plot, which should be subversive and controversial, fails to rise above the trashy romance novel level, and the (I think they're supposed to be shocking) sex scenes wouldn't shock anyone except my Amish Aunt Minnie.  I actually laughed out loud several times as I read them because I pictured Clark Gable/Rhett Butler saying some of this ridiculous dialogue.    The plot here is so flaccid that Randall inadvertently undermines her own book.  The white characters remain more interesting than any of the black characters.  This despite the fact Randall gives them tons of dirty linen to air in an obvious (and pathetic) attempt to make them interesting.  Her black characters are non-entities, which I believe was her beef with Mitchell in the first place....right?!   As a result, by writing TWDG, Randall is only spray painting a nasty word on the castle walls of GWTW when what she needed to do was bulldoze the original, dance gleefully on its grave, and create something very powerful in its place.  But that would take a skilled writer, and Randall just doesn't have the goods.  "Taking on" GWTW is a great idea, especially to stir up discussion around issues of racism and slavery in our country and our history.  However, to do an idea like that justice requires a talented author (i.e., not Alice Randall).  Maybe Toni Morrison should take this on?  I'd read that 
 I found this book not morally complex or sophisticated so much as just plain offensive and cruel.  I don't see the point of taking us inside the minds of teens who would even consider such a brutal crime as kidnapping and terrorizing another human being.  This has none of the layers and provocative questions of "Lord of the Flies."  It was, to me, pointless.  Most teens I know are interested in cleaner fare, in deep questions about life on other subjects.  And despite the predominance of disturbing themes and plots in teen novels, many teens I know look for other books instead; they really aren't that interested in stories of kidnap, rape, incest, suicide, and murder.  
 First of all I love the chistmas box the book. I have read it and re-read it. I also liked the other 2 books in the series. But i was dissapointed with this movie. I am not saying that its a bad movie but i think that it took most of what was special and magical and left it out. And also the book didn't take place in the 90's it took place in the 1940's. The acting was average nothing else. the only one to live up to the charater in the book was ms. O'toole as keri. I hope they someday make a more faithful movie also they changed little things that they had no reason to change. richard owned a formal wear co. not a ski company, and they didn't move from seattle 
 I was instantly intrigued by this book. I was disappointed that of the 242 pages, it take until page 181 for him to decide to even play Traumerei for his wife.  Quite frankly, this book is filled with self indulgant nonsense. If Adams had stuck to the idea of writing a book about just learning piano , it would have been fine. Instead he meanders onto subjects such buying boats and taking trips. What does any of that crap have to do with playing piano?  I think Noah Adam's experience is very indicative of the "I want everything now with little work" philosophy that pervades our country. I have very little doubt that the exquisite Steinway he bought has either been sold or is gathering dust. What a shame.  
 Martin Gilbet wrote a simmilarly written account of the Second World War - a big flat narrative taking everything in one volume. I thought it was quite inadaquate, but Gilbert at least tried to get the facts right. I was amazed by some of Keegan's statements, such as his belief that Koenig surrendered in at Bir Hakeim. Even the most casual student of the north African theatre in of 1940-43 knows that Koenig and his soldiers broke through the German lines and escaped to fight another day. A serious historian would not make such a blunder. But I do not think Keegan is a serious historian for there are many such instances in the book. He does not seem to really care for his subject. Having read a few of his books I am disapointed and even surprised that some readers and reviewers regard him so highly. He does not diserve it 
 The authors state in the preface to their book that their goal is to provide "a thorough approach to semi-Markov processes and their applications in reliability". This is an ambitious objective for a 222 page text, since a large body of research on Semi-Markov processes has developed over the course of the last forty years or so.  In the opinion of this reviewer, Limnios & Oprisan never even come close to their grand objective. Their book is simply too short, too terse and too condensed to give a thorough treatment. The authors realized early on that they would need to reference the vast body of literature. It is strange to this reviewer that their treatment, copyright 2001, chooses as its main references out-of-print French texts by Neveu (1964) and Janssen (1969). The authors' choice of difficult-to-find auxiliary references makes their treatment that much less accessible.  The prerequisite list here is extensive. The authors claim that all that is required is an understanding of Markov Chains, like you might find in Stroock's "Introduction to Markov Processes" or Norris' "Markov Chains". Furthermore, the authors claim to cover the following list of topics in the first 29 pages of their book (which comprises Chapter 1): measure theory, Laplace transforms and continuous-time Markov processes. In reality, Limnios & Oprisan introduce (barely) these and other topics including: stopping times, the Optional Stopping Theorem, stationary stochastic processes, martingale theory, Ergodic theory, strong Markov Processes and renewal processes.    In order to get through the first chapter of Limnios & Oprisan, you'll need an excellent background in these topics. I recommend Rogers & Williams 800 page, two-volume set "Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales", 2nd edition.  Chapter 2 runs a mere 18 pages and purports to cover "Markov Renewal Processes". I stopped counting how many times the authors give references to out-of-print books in this chapter. I also lost count of the number of times the authors use the phrases "it is straightforward", "it is easy to show", or "it is well-known", in the context of mathematical problems having none of the above properties.  This book is useful to the reader in one sense: it whets the appetite for an understanding of Semi-Markov Processes and Reliability Theory and puts this reviewer in the market for a well-written book on the topic.       
 The American Civil War should have been named Robert E. Lee's Civil War. 85% of the books attention is paid to Lee's character, Lee's battles, Lee's brilliance, Lee's nobility, Lee's wisdom.  At the end of the War Churchill  rightly criticizes Lee for his faulty generalship in sending thousands to  die in frontal assaults when the war was clearly lost, but his fixation on  Lee still borders on worship.  There were other things going on in the War,  like the War in the West, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta campaign, March  to the Sea, etc., but Churchill concludes these events did not require any  full discussion.  Either Winston had a deadline to meet and was out of time  or he displays a surprising lack of knowledge by leaving out at least half  of the Civil War.  But of course if you are a Lee fan, then you'll love  this one 
 This is just another book about the holocaust and hungarian jews, and not one of the good ones.The title and back cover has little to do with the book itself, The few American POWs stories are there only to justify the title of the book. It's a shame to use our soldiers in order to sell a book that otherwise would end up in the clearence section not long after printed 
 Poor quality. Does not seem to have any background music. I'm not sure why 
 After reading an overview regarding the plot of this book, I decided to give Ed McBain's latest novel a whirl.  After 20 minutes into the book, I had the mystery figured out.  Okay, I was a little off on one of the characters (I surmised it was a girl in the Caribbean and actually it was a black girl who worked at the local ice cream depot, but still...).  I read the entire book in one day and while enjoyable, it is predictable even to the politically correct Bush bashing (bad economy and he stole the election from Gore, dag-nabbit) which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot.  If you want a mindless, easy-to-put-down and finish quickly book, "Alice in Jeopardy" is for you.  If you want a novel full of surprises and twists, amazing characters and an author who leaves his personal politics out of the story, pick up a Harlan Coben novel 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 I bought this label maker for my nephew as a Christmas present.  The only labels available then were white.  Now I can't get any labels.  There goes a great gift that will only last as long as the refill 
 i got the cd expecting something truly out of the ordinary.  instead i got very bland music.  i'm fairly open minded and have wide musical tastes, but this was pure garbage (no offense).  as a matter of fact i tossed the cd in the garbage at work... 
 I found this book to be an extremely basic introduction to the field of Physical Therapy.  It might be helpful to a student in High School (or perhaps even Junior High) But for an undergraduate or grad student it was of little or no help 
 Who are these editors?  How long have they been business?  I'm a travel writer published in many publiscation and I never use this book for fact-finding for my articles.  I think the internet is more reliable and accurate.  With 1 travel book to my name, I have found everything for it on the internet.   
 These glasses were a bit of a disappointment.  The convenience was out weighed by the uncomfortable fit - they were really snug with no possibility of adjustment.  And actually they were annoying with how they hung when not in use.  Great idea but maybe some "fine tuning" would help...like a more flexible strap rather than the plastic frame just being super long to go around your neck. 
 I think Collaborative Web Development was ahead of its time when it was written in 1999, but today it reads more like a relic.  It also doesn't help that the writing style is rudimentary (Ms. Burdman should've considered using a ghost writer) and the book is littered with typos.  Maybe the book could be useful to people who have absolutely no experience in working with companies that have a web site, but there's got to be better stuff out there.  I would NOT recommend Collaborative Web Development for anyone who has any bit of experience in project managing for the web. 
 o.k., i just finished listening to the C.D. of Predator, which i had downloaded on my I-pod.   Well, i kept thinking the book was abridged, or maybe i had made a mistake in the download.  It jumped around so much that i was convinced it was abridged, but it wasn't!  i have so many questions, i can't even list them all, and think maybe we should all form an on-line group to see if any of us can answer them.  1. was Johnny the doctor killed or was it suicide?  and who killed him, and most importanly, WHY?    2. why were the members of the family killed and how were they known by the serial killer? 3. when did Kay and Benton make up, and why the heck is she always so angry? this is just the beginning 
 This movie is a Shakespeare play. The dialog is impossible to understand for MUCH of this movie. Anyone who says that they understand everything these actors are saying must be lying. No one speaks this way now and it is very hard to follow. I wish I had known that it was Shakespeare before I bought it, but for some reason I didn't. The movie is also like a play but in a movie format. This might not be to everyone's liking. Just be cautious of all these rave reviews. People here claiming this review as not helpful are the ones pretending like they understand every word of a Shakespeare play. I would just like to continuously pause the dvd and ask them what the actors just said and let them fumble over themselves trying to explain 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 Littel has written a book about undercover agents that assume identities and personalities, called "Legends". The premise behind the book, and this may be kind of vague because I read the book several months ago, is that one of these undercover agents (or former agents?) is seemingly struggling with a personality disorder that obscures his reality. Not only does the character seem to have issues with reality, but the reader is left guessing as to the certainty of many of the vingnettes that are loosly slapped together in this plodding, oftentimes aimless read.   The story is not very gripping or believable. There are flash-in-the-pan moments where the author paints a comical scene in what reminds me of the incredulous, but believable style of Tom Robbins. On the other hand, the book tries desperately to take on this Tom Clancy seriousness that is totally unbelievable in view of its outrageous episodes.   Perhaps I would have enjoyed  "Legends" had I read it more carefully. I read the book for pleasure and escape from a life of reading impossibly dull legal tomes. So mabye, had I approached the book with greater diligence and less expectations, it is possible that I would have enjoyed it. 
 I came across this movie on T.V. and was so excited that there was a sequel to Merlin, a film I thought was fabulous. I was completely wrong. This move is so flawed, I don't even know where to begin.   First off, the story in no way correlates with the first movie, except for the fact that Sam Neil and Miranda Richardson have parts in it. You could fall into the plot holes. So, Merlin leaves Camelot in the care of Arthur with the belief that everything is secure. He goes a takes a "nap"  and accidentally sleeps for 50 years. He wakes up totally confused and puzzled (which he keeps telling us over and over by stating his questions aloud). Camelot has gone way down hill. Blah, blah, blah. Enter Jack, a thief with magical abilities. It's later revealed that he is the love child of Merlin and the Lady of the Lake, played by Miranda Richardson. By the way, in this movie, the Lady is evil and resembles Queen Mab more than she did in the first film. So, Camelot is sacked by crazy wood-dwelling people, the rulers are corrupt, Merlin dies half way through, etc. Jack along with Gawain's granddaughter, her lover blacksmith, a squire named "Brian" (whose really a very masculine looking female named Brianna) go on a quest to restore the lost grail (which Arthur supposedly found earlier)and save Camelot. A great battle errupts with the crazy people, everyone dies, Jack saves them with the grail, and shacks up with a very masculine Brianna to "sow some seeds" (...enough said).   The plot is overly drawn out and boring, the characters/actors lack any depth or redeeming qualities, the writing is horrible and cheesy, and Merlin really lacks any substantial part (plus he's a bumbling idiot). This movie was a complete waste of time. There is no mention of any of the characters in the first film (i.e. Nimue, Mab, Frik, etc.) I advise any who saw the first movie...dont bother with this one 
 This doll was a great dissapointment. Once you take it out of the box, you will find out that the doll's body is  oddly shaped. Half of the legs are fabric, and the main body is too heavy for its extremities - the doll cannot stand or sit. Mine did not recognize its cup, as it supposed to, and it really grows too fast into a toddler. Most of the times it does not respond when you give the commands. Also it is not as cute as in the picture. I would not recommend this doll to anybody 
 Just finished a 16 week baking course based on this book.  While the technical information is valid, the majority of the formulas/recipes produced tasteless products.  Most of the students are not even keeping the book because the recipes are so bad.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 I purchased this memory card for a camera I was also purchasing. It was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page. When I received the card first and then the camera, I was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit. Because I had opened the plastic package to the card, I was unable to return it. In fact, when I emailed the company who sent it, I never even received a response. 
 This is one of those CD's that are good for one song.  "Remind Me" from the Geico Caveman commercial where he is in the airport and sees his poster on the wall.  It is clear that Royksopp has done much better with their newest CD "The Understanding" it has at least 3 good songs.  I like Royksopp when they actually create music instead of certain cacophonous filler material. "Remind Me", "Only This Moment", "What Else Is There?", and "49 Percent" are their best works, 3 of which are found on the CD "The Understanding". They are pretty good, but if they really want to impress, they should continue writing songs like "Only This Moment" and "What Else Is There?". "Remind Me" is cool, but I was disappointed with the rest of the boring stuff on the "Melody A.M." CD 
 		This amusing exercise in literary invention and clever psycho-babble portrays Jefferson as the original neocon who had the wisdom and foresight to establish useful precedents for today's neoconservatives.  	Hitchens, a prominent neocon flack who is clearly obsessed with sex and race, offers a confusing portrait of Jefferson that clearly reflects the artist more than the subject.  Think of a Picasso painting;  the technique would be instantly recognized even if the subject is a mystery.  Hitchens devotes almost eight pages to Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemings.  Why?  He doesn't offer a shred of evidence that Hemings contributed anything to the historical accomplishments of Jefferson, except in the form of several children who duly received special dispensation from Jefferson.    	But he goes into great speculation about how the Declaration of Independence is based on Saxon/German principles transplanted to America.  My, my, what an original reason for the American War of Independence.  It all originates in ancient Germanic feuds between Hanover (King George's ancestors) and Saxony.  Take that!!  all you Angles, Jutes, Normams, Welsh, Celts, Norwegians, Danes and other assorted invaders, raiders, traders and natives who made The Glorious Revolution of 1688.  	His concludes "history is a tragedy and not a morality tale."  Wrong.  History is the uneven progress of humans toward personal freedom, a process magnificently exemplified by Jefferson who used the principles and often the words of the Glorious Revolution to articulate a major leap forward in democracy.  Instead, this book is an example of propaganda intended to make basic values sound like the sole property of one specific faction, and in this case it's a masterful hijack of the Jefferson legend for the neocon cause.  	Hitchens is an often acerbic and perceptive critic of fuzzy logic and hypocrisy;  but, this book is a case of a man who refuses to see but nonetheless wants to lead the blind by attempting to cram history into the folly of modern neocon thought.  History is not a series of events frozen in the stone statues of dead heroes, which is the essence of neocon nonsense;  it is an alive and evolving process as fully complex and unpredictable as any chaos in nature.  	It's a feeble effort by an often brilliant and perceptive analyst of American thought and attitude.  His folly began with his claim the American Revolution "was thus emphatically for export".  Oh?  George Washington thought the opposite, that others were welcome to copy but it was not to be force fed to anyone.  It's Republicans, since the 1860s, who believe the American Revolution is emphatically for export and thus deserves to be cannon blasted into policies of less enlightened nations.  	In his introduction, Hitchens recognizes everything in life contains contradictions or paradoxes and adds, "Jefferson was a contradiction, and this will be found at every step of the narrative that goes to make up his life."    	True enough.  But there are also great principles in life, and Jefferson is one of the rare individuals in history who recognized and advanced the great principle of personal freedom.  In today's clash of civilisations that idea is worth understanding;  unfortunately, Hitchens becomes so wrapped up in the contradictions of Jefferson's sex life that he loses sight of Jefferson's crowning achievement.  	It makes the book interesting but irrelevant.    
 Jill Ann Spaulding claims to have read Playboy since she was a child, around 1980.  As an adult, she collected Playboy covers and sought out the models to sign them.  If she ever bothered to READ any of the issues, especially the anniversary issues, she would have learned that Hef had romantic involvements (sex) with Playmates CONSTANTLY, ever since the magazine was founded.  And then, at age 30 or 31, she becomes obsessed with becoming a Playmate and living at the mansion, despite the fact that she's been living with her boyfriend of 11 years.    So she sends nude photos to Hefner and wangles an invite to the mansion.  And she's shocked, SHOCKED, when she finds that Hef's having UNPROTECTED SEX with ALL of the girlfriends that he's photographed with month after month.  THEN the author continues to beg to be invited to parties, etc., and sends Hef gushing notes and presents to his girlfriends.  She spends most of the book talking about meeting celebrities and how beautiful she is.  Memo to Jill Ann: In 2006, a "girlfriend" by definition is someone you have sex with.  If a man is photographed month after month in public in the company of ALL his girlfriends AT THE SAME TIME, it's a pretty safe bet that they get in bed together at the same time also.  You wanted to go to mansion parties and you got to.  Hef likes having multiple girls at a time and you aren't into that. Hef was considerably more gracious to you than I would have been.  You claim to be a great poker player who wins tournaments.  Would you expect to enter a tournament without paying the entry fee 
 The book is a good reading, interesting and stimulant, but it was too much of a subject to this distinct author, James Hillman. You need way more vision, research and knowledge of the "invisible" to make such passionated affirmations. Hillman does a great job in questioning old habits and the ugliest shortcuts of modern Psychology, and if I had to tell what's the merit of this book, that would be it. Fact is his theory for the soul's code isn't right, or isn't complete, in my view. A simple exercise of taking what he writes in this book and put under a rigorous Socrates questioning (dialectics approach) would ruin good part of Hillman's affirmations. He chose to promote the so-called "daimon" to God and in order to support this he had to ignore the real holystic Truth. He's better than the avarage Psychology, but not there yet 
 I was a big, big fan of the original RiftWar series and the Empire series co-authored with Janny Wurts, so I thought I'd check out what Feist had written recently. I now wish I hadn't. To be blunt, I was disgusted by this book and couldn't finish it. The writing is good enough, but the whole atmosphere is nasty.   The whole book reads like a long S&M fantasy. Talon is a hopeless character who is constantly used and bullied by the people around him, the supposed "good people" in the world. He doesn't stand up to them, rather he seems to think it is his place to be put down and humiliated.  I was particularly revolted to see Pug, a character I had grown quite fond of in previous books, acting so cruel and callous.    I do not recommend this book to anyone 
 Think this is a 'fun' sampler of B movies? Think again. Contains offensive pornography. Not terribly sexually explicit but full of violent and degrading situations. I feel guilty giving it 1 star, but that was the lowest rating available 
 I think that I am clearly insane, but I did not like this book. Everyone else in the world likes this book, but i am the insane person who does not. And I'm NOT sarcastic! I could barly read it a second time. I hated this book. 
 you will get nothing out of this. don't waste your money, especially at these prices. there's basically nothing here 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 The title says it all. They could have put a better group of songs togather 
 The late Jim Garrison's book "On The Trail Of The Assassins" was in large part the basis for Oliver Stone's 1991 motion picture "JFK", which is a film containing so many lies, half-truths, and misrepresentations of the facts surrounding John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, it's literally difficult to keep up with all of them.  I cannot watch one single scene of Oliver Stone's film without finding some distortion of the evidence in the real JFK or J.D. Tippit murder cases. Some are small things being distorted; and some are great big ones. One example (among dozens) being: Oliver Stone's version of shoe clerk Johnny Brewer's testimony re. Lee Harvey Oswald's manner of dress when Brewer encountered Oswald shortly after Oswald had shot and killed policeman Tippit.  Stone, in his film, has Oswald (Gary Oldman) wearing a jacket as he enters the Texas Theater and is seen by Brewer....and in one of the movie's "Deleted Scenes" (on the DVD version of the film), Kevin Costner (playing Garrison) even does a voice-over (lie) re. Brewer's testimony, with Costner saying "Brewer said the man was wearing a jacket".  Brewer, in reality, said exactly the opposite during his Warren Commission testimony:  Mr. BELIN -- "Will you describe the man you saw?" Mr. BREWER -- "He was a little man, about 5'9", and weighed about 150 pounds is all. ... And had brown hair. He had a brown sports shirt on. His shirt tail was out." Mr. BELIN -- "Any jacket?" Mr. BREWER -- "No."  Another interesting part of the Tippit portion of the movie "JFK" is Oliver Stone's Audio Commentary during this part of the film, which is riddled with inaccuracies. Stone has the audacity to spout the following lie re. the Tippit shooting on the DVD's Commentary soundtrack:  "Not one credible witness has really identified Oswald as a single shooter {of Officer Tippit}. In fact, the only significant testimony applies two to three shooters." -- O. Stone  Therefore, per Mr. Stone (and Garrison said pretty much the same thing years earlier), the "only credible" witness must have been Acquilla Clemmons, who, as far as I am aware, was THE ONLY witness who ever said there was more than one person involved in the Tippit slaying.  Stone, like Jim Garrison before him, would simply rather believe his OWN version of events, rather than the multiple witnesses who never saw more than one shooter (with that one single shooter being positively identified as Oswald by said witnesses).  It's interesting, indeed, that Stone thinks the "only significant testimony" re. the Tippit crime came from Clemmons. Whereas, people like Markham, Tatum, and Scoggins (who were all closer than Clemmons to the scene of the murder) are deemed less "significant", merely, no doubt, because they don't fit into Stone's (or Garrison's) "CT Landscape" surrounding the murder.  I wonder if people realize just how many outright lies are contained in Oliver Stone's 3-hour, 15-minute motion picture? The number is simply staggering. And that number of distortions is increased considerably on the DVD version of the film, when the Audio Commentary Track by Mr. Stone and all of the "Deleted and Extended Scenes" are included as well.  And a great deal of this deliberate misinformation put forth on the movie screen came directly out of this book authored by Jim Garrison.  Another great place to see more of Mr. Garrison's skewed views of the JFK case is to read Garrison's 1967 "Playboy Magazine" interview. Like Stone's movie, that Playboy article will keep you busy as you try to keep up with the inaccurate things Garrison keeps saying in that lengthy piece. The whole interview can be read here:  www.jfklancer.com/Garrison2.html   Selected examples of Mr. Garrison's paranoia and loony-toon conspiracy talk, taken from that Playboy interview, are provided via the quotes below. My own rebuttal arguments follow each quote:   "Though he {Oswald} may not have known why he was instructed to do so, this was undoubtedly why he got the job at the Texas School Book Depository Building. The conspirators knew this would place him on the scene and convince the world that a demented Marxist was the real assassin." -- Jim Garrison; 1967  The above Garrison gem totally distorts (or just flat-out ignores) the true and documented facts about how Oswald got his job at the Depository in mid-October of '63. It was suburban Dallas housewives Linnie Mae Randle and Ruth Paine who were directly responsible for placing Lee Harvey Oswald in the TSBD, by way of ordinary garden-variety happenstance.  Garrison must, therefore, believe that Mrs. Paine, who arranged Oswald's job interview with Depository boss Roy Truly, was one of the main "conspirators" who was setting up Oswald to take the fall for JFK's murder the following month (which would also have to mean that Paine had detailed knowledge of the President's motorcade route more than a month before November 22). Garrison must also think that Roy Truly was a big part of the patsy plot, because it was Mr. Truly who actually hired Oswald (even though nobody was holding a shotgun to Truly's head forcing him to hire Lee).  The commonly-held belief that Lee Oswald was "placed" in the Texas School Book Depository by evil plotters prior to 11/22/63 is a desperate attempt by CTers like Mr. Garrison to attach unprovable and unsupportable conspiratorial "strings" to a random event that involved several individuals...individuals whose collective and synchronized actions could not possibly have been foreseen and controlled by a group of behind-the-scenes conspirators.  ---------------  "Anyone who takes the time to read the Warren Report will find that of the witnesses in Dealey Plaza who were able to assess the origin of the shots, almost two-thirds said they came from the grassy-knoll area in front and to the right of the Presidential limousine and not from the Book Depository." -- Jim Garrison; 1967  This is pure nonsense. There were, indeed, several witnesses who said they heard shots coming from in front of JFK's car, but Garrison has severely skewed the stats to support his claim of Knoll shooters. His "almost two-thirds" figure is not even close to being accurate when talking about the number of witnesses who said they heard frontal shots. And even amongst other CTers, virtually no other pro-conspiracy author has ever rigged those stats in such an out-of-whack manner.  The fact is that more than half of all earwitnesses heard shots coming from the direction of the Book Depository, and not from the Knoll. And an even more illuminating statistic reveals that less than 5% of all earwitnesses heard shots from more than just a single general location (front vs. rear). That stat speaks volumes....because even CTers admit to SOME rear shots.  An interesting tabulation of this data can be found below:  http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/images/shots4.jpg  http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/earwitnesses.htm  ---------------  "The second shot struck the President in the back; the location of this wound can be verified not by consulting the official autopsy report, but by perusing the reports filed by two FBI agents who were present at the President's autopsy. Both stated unequivocally that the bullet in question entered President Kennedy's back and did not continue through his body." -- Jim Garrison; 1967  Therefore, Mr. Garrison is, in essence, saying that he is much more likely to trust the word of FBI agents (who, of course, were not doctors and were not conducting the President's autopsy) rather than take the word of the three physicians who each signed the official autopsy report. After all, why believe the autopsy doctors when you COULD just trust as Gospel the word of a bystander? ~sarcasm alert~  Plus: Why didn't these two FBI agents get the conspirators' memo which, if CTers are right about the success of the Patsy Plot, must have been passed out to nearly everyone in Officialdom on 11/22, a memo that probably said: "Attn. All Agents -- We're framing Oswald tomorrow; so remember to falsify as much evidence as humanly possible to ensure conviction of patsy".   Evidently some people who needed to see it never received that important document.  ---------------  "We have also located another man who was not involved in the shooting but created a diversionary action in order to distract people's attention from the snipers. This individual screamed, fell to the ground, and simulated an epileptic fit, drawing people away from the vicinity of the knoll just before the President's motorcade reached the ambush point." -- Jim Garrison; 1967  Yet another outright lie from the lips of District Attorney Garrison. The man who had the so-called "simulated epileptic fit" was fully identified by the FBI on May 26, 1964. His name was Jerry Belknap, a man who had a history of epilepsy since childhood. Belknap also proved to the FBI that he had paid the ambulance bill ($12.50) after he was taken to Parkland Hospital.  ---------------  "President Kennedy was killed for one reason: because he was working for a reconciliation with the U.S.S.R. and Castro's Cuba. His assassins were a group of fanatic anti-Communists with a fusion of interests in preventing Kennedy from achieving peaceful relations with the Communist world." -- Jim Garrison; 1967  Any solid, verifiable proof of such accusations, Mr. Garrison? Any physical evidence whatsoever that shows JFK was killed by more than one gun? .... The answers to those two questions are: No and No.   But the lack of physical evidence never stopped a hard-boiled CTer....that's been proven over and over again by a vast assortment of conspiracists who have more theories up their sleeve than a dog has fleas.  ---------------  "In summation, there were at least five or six shots fired at the President from front and rear by at least four gunmen, assisted by several accomplices. At this stage of events, Lee Harvey Oswald was no more than a spectator to the assassination -- perhaps in a very literal sense. James Altgens snapped a picture that shows a man with a remarkable resemblance to Oswald, standing in the doorway of the Depository. The Altgens photograph indicates the very real possibility that at the moment Oswald was supposed to have been shooting Kennedy, he may actually have been standing outside the front door watching the motorcade. .... I don't believe that Oswald shot anybody on November 22nd -- not the President and not Tippit." -- Jim Garrison; 1967  It seems as though these devilishly-clever conspirators forgot one important thing when they were setting up LHO -- they forgot their brains. For, who WITH brains would allow their lone "Patsy" to casually drift outside and be photographed and seen by countless witnesses when the plotters need to have Lee Harvey on the 6th Floor at 12:30? Per Mr. Garrison's account of Oswald possibly being "Doorway Man", evidently the real assassins were indeed brainless and lacked the common sense to keep Oswald where he wouldn't be able to establish a credible alibi for his 12:30 whereabouts.  Just think about these Garrison remarks for a moment longer too -- "At least five or six shots were fired at the President from front and rear ... by at least four gunmen".  Doesn't a "4-Shooter, 6-Shot, 1-Patsy" assassination plot seem a bit unlikely to anyone else but this writer? Would any professional killers actually attempt to "frame" a lone fall guy in that type of overkill fashion? In my opinion, no pro hit men would go about the complicated task of setting up Oswald (or anybody else) in such a needlessly-reckless way.  A single "pro" hit man could have easily killed JFK with one or two shots (probably just one) from Oswald's "nest", without the need to clog the works with needless back-up gunmen hiding all around Dealey Plaza.   There is no possible way the conspirators could have ensured the success of a multi-shooter plot to frame JUST Oswald in the minutes during and after the shooting. No way. There are way too many uncontrollable factors that could block the success of that One-Patsy venture that Jim Garrison placed his faith in.  "Uncontrollable" items such as:   1.) A frontal shooter might very well have been seen by witnesses (and to think that EVERY witness under the sun could be easily "bought", "taken care of", and/or coerced by these plotters is, again, just too much wishful thinking on the conspirators' part, IMO).  2.) A frontal shooter might strike other occupants in the car, or strike somebody else in Dealey Plaza. But even if ONLY Kennedy is hit by a frontal gunman, there are massive problems to be "corrected" by the conspirators....bullets to be hidden and, of course, who knows how many obvious frontal wounds on the victim to be (somehow) eliminated -- and eliminated immediately before any non-conspirators can spill any beans. .... Only a person straight out of the booby hatch could believe that anyone, regardless of "power" or "pull", could get away with such a thing. It's just plain loony.  3.) The one "Patsy" (Oswald) could have easily, by pure accident and happenstance, established a perfect alibi for himself at the time when he was supposed to be on the 6th Floor shooting the President (as Mr. Garrison apparently DID think occurred, with Oswald being seen in a photo taken as the bullets were flying; even though all reasonable researchers know full well that "Doorway Man" was actually Billy Lovelady, and not Oswald; Lovelady even testified to that effect in 1964). ....  Plus -- If Oswald had really been in that doorway at 12:30, WHY ON EARTH DIDN'T HE SAY HE WAS THERE?! If he's got an ironclad alibi like that, why wouldn't he use it? Instead, he says not a word about being outside on the steps at 12:30, and even tells the police a provable lie re. his whereabouts (the lie about "having lunch with Junior {Jarman}" at the time of the shooting). How much sense does that make if Oswald had really been in the Depository doorway? ....  And the very fact that Oswald did NOT have a usable, provable alibi for exactly 12:30 PM is absolutely remarkable IF he had really been wandering around on the lower floors of the Depository (or was outside the building), as many CTers firmly believe; and even the most rabid of conspiracy theorists have got to admit, that from the "CT/Patsy" POV, Oswald's not having a usable/believable/solid alibi is certainly, by far, the biggest piece of LUCK in the whole "Patsy Plot". ....  These amazing Patsy Plotters just lucked out, evidently, in that Oswald was not seen by a single person inside or outside the TSBD at precisely the time of the assassination -- except by Howard Brennan, Ron Fischer, and Robert Edwards, of course, who saw Oswald or a nicely-arranged Oswald "imposter" in the Sniper's Nest at 12:30 or just seconds before 12:30.  4.) And the likelihood that all of the non-TSBD bullets are going to somehow get swept under the rug is extremely remote, especially in a Bob Groden-like scenario. Mr. Groden (per his book "The Killing Of A President"), incredibly, has ZERO of the shots coming from the Oswald window, and a total of up to TEN shots being fired...and ALL OF THEM coming from rifles other than the one rifle these idiot plotters are going to attempt to frame Oswald with! Could Groden's scenario BE any more reckless and preposterous?! I doubt it.  5.) And a biggie, that most CTers evidently don't think could have ever happened before 12:30 on November 22nd -- The one Patsy (Mr. LHO) could "get wise" to the plot that is brewing all around him and take measures to guarantee he could never be blamed for the actual assassination of John Kennedy.  When thinking about any "Frame Lee Oswald As The One Patsy" plan, I just cannot visualize any professional assassins (even for a minute) contemplating the use of multiple shooters; let alone some gunmen firing from the Grassy Knoll, i.e., the exact opposite direction from where their single dupe is supposed to be located.  ---------------------  As the previously-mentioned quotes from the mouth of Mr. Garrison amply demonstate, if anyone has a desire to set out "On The Trail Of A Lunatic Conspiracy Theorist" -- look no further than Earling Carothers (Jim) Garrison. 
 If you want my advice before buying this one,  it's this: Save your money 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 This is a blatant commercial overture, as tonight and this, both tried to recapture Lets Dance popularity.  The songs, are not so bad.  The commercial texture and deliver, is horrific.  As if Bowie envisioned a tour with Chaka Kahn and Madonna, when that age was already over.  Postpunk was already being pasteurized as 'alternative' for the masses.  So Bowie was outdated by something he inspired himself just 10 years earlier.  But what from Bowie wasnt a commercial attempt?  To say he was vanguard and underground before Lets Dance is incorrect.  Only his Berlin Trio- low/heroes/lodger, was left field.  He was very popular in the 70s.  People forget this now bc he was so original.  Lets Dance, which was about when he came to my pre-teen attention, was a brilliant 80s album.  It was popular and so he was crucified for later works.  The album cover does not help either.  It looks like he is trying to make an innocuous hit that housewives, college kids, and teenagers will all buy with the Zany Writing and colors! and look he has Baggy Pants on 
    Well first off, I did not like the book nor the movie, both have enough plot holes to make a swiss cheese look like art.     On the other hand, I take excption to some of the neagtive reviews listed here, as some sound very anti-american in their reviews.  We being good Americans are intelligent enough to read good books and tell what stories make good patriotism and what does not.   We do not have to justify this to anyone who lives outside of the American experience for that.  If you do not understand this, TNEN BE QUIET ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
 Company Business, 1991 film This film starts with a simple deal. An imprisoned Soviet spy and $2,000,000 will be exchanged for a captured American. The deal will be done in an underground station in Berlin. But something is wrong, and the deal is canceled before the swap is done. The opposition open fire, but they escape from them, and the people Sam works for. Now the plot has them on the run with the Two Million in marked money. They escape from the people who pursue them. Until they are found.  The CIA wants to turn over the money to the KGB so they can ransom the captured American. [This money seems to come from a South American drug exporter who makes deals with the right people, the aftermath of the "Contragate" scandal.] But there are complications in the plans. Sam and the Russian plan to take the money for their retirement to the sunny Seychelles. They are found and one is captured. So now they plan to escape with the money. These two manage to outwit the combined forces of the CIA and KGB. Believable? You will see many sights in this film, with humorous scenes.  It will remind you of countless similar stories from "The Defiant Ones" to whatever will be in the movie theaters this year. 
 I was not nearly as enamored with this book as most of the reviewers below. The biggest problem for me is that Alice simply was not a sympathetic character. She whines and excuses her bad behavior all the way through. She also covers up for and excuses the deplorable behavior of her near-do-well son. The only sympathetic character was the husband, who I sided with and felt extremely sorry for throughout the entire story. Her trips to the shrink are boring and add little to the story. I also thought that Alice was ridiculously over dramatic about the "secret" from her childhood she finally remembers, and overly dramatic about the death of her parents, as if she is the only person in the world who has ever suffered these experiences. Woe is me! Sounded like a pity party to me. All and all, not a winning story line, although the writing itself was really good. Perhaps I'll try one of her previous books and see if the story is better. 
 The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
 Here's a brief synopsis of this "novel": 1) Captain Mack Mackey (Imaginative name isn't it) is assigned the most advanced submarine ever made for the US Navy. 2) US and China go to war, and Mack is thrown into action. 3) Mack spots a chinese submarine. he fires a torpedo. he sinks it. 4) Mack spots 2 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them. 5) Mack spots 3 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them. 6) Mack spots 5 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them. 7) Mack spots 1,000,000,000 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.......  Throughout this novel, the SSN submarine never faces a single challenge or sustains any major damage. one submarine takes out pretty much the entire chinese submarine fleet. At least this novel has realism going for it 
 I was expecting to finally get a real insight into the business nightmare that was Apple and its role in the destruction of the Beatles when they had to become exactly what they said they hated: businessmen. Instead, I get a lot of sloppy investigative work that's almost all based on hearsay by people who weren't the meeting rooms they're reporting about and other very well-known quotes used by the authors like they were given to them directly (which they weren't). It's unofrtunate because a book on this topic needs to get written. This is not it. Also, it was clearly thrown together in great haste after the collapse of the Beatles and the editor in charge was out sick the week the galleys were delivered 
 After listening to Glenn's 'Soul Mover', I guess this is what i should have expected. just an absolute bore! Ok now that thats out of the way, let me rant- when the hell is some veteran musicans gonna put out something that just fking jams. Because it sure as fk aint Metalica. It aint mp3s's or pirating thats keeping good bands away, there just aint any pulling all the stops, and i'm too fking old the take this roll, so if you come come across a great band ,suport the hell out of them 
 Saw this one on television.   Vincent van Gogh was misfortunate in life and certainly crazy. The artist who portrays him does his job very well.  The scenery is breathtaking.  However the nudity  in the film is vulgar. The chaeracters are hard to identify with. Some of the scenes are disgusting.   Not going to see this one again 
 I can't say enuff 'bout this but I thought it was a novel that has to deal w/ life of something like from famous black authors of Richard Wright to Langston Hughes to Ralph Ellison or somethin like that. I believe it's a ok book even tho I don't read it very oftenly all the time 'cuz it deals w/ the situations between HIV/AIDS, sex and celibacy. First of all I never read a sex book in my life. I thought it was cool but it goes to tell you how to beware about the diffrence bout the good side vs. the bad side of sex. I'ma think I'll keep it 'round a lil longer or so. Good work E. Lynn Harris 
 Well I grant it that the title is what drew me in. After all who does not want to see if anyone they know has the hand of a criminal!  So I read  it...and then i tossed it in the recycling bin. Now dont get me wrong I am  very much into esoteric subjects. However I am also into what is known as  intelligence and logic. Yes esoterics and logics can go hand in hand....the  trick is not to go overboard in esoteric (think Shirley McClaine) and not  to go overboard in logic (think egghead). Moderation, a balance is what is  needed.  So every book I read follows the key of balance. This book failed.  Now we cannot abandon DNA, because DNA and genetics plays a huge role in  our physical embodiment. To say that you can tell a criminal by their hand  shape and the way their thumb looks is intriguing...but soon turns to  ridiculous when you have taken any biology course. Look at your family and  compare your hands...if one of you has a certain nail shape...chances are  other family members if not all will have similar hands...thats called  genetic. So I am VERY wary of those that claim the physical body tells us  more then we realize. If you want an excellent book on palmistry, dont  waste your money on this one.

 The main benefit of working through this meandering novel, as I now look back on it, was to gain a glimpse of pre-revolutionary America.  What attracted me to the book was the author's credentials as an historian.  If  the story's tensions, moods, and conlicts are historically accurate than  the perspective it generates is intriguing.  The search for a national and  cultural identity among the changing political landscapes must have been  most demanding upon the citizens of the colonies.  The author describes how  the various influences of the Dutch, British, French, African, and native  American Indians converged in a cultural boiling pot. The plot and  characters were tolerable.  Although, there were times when I thought of  putting the book aside to find a more rewarding read.  Yet, the sense that  finally emerged for me was one of appreciation for the gradual and  difficult movement it must have been for the colonists to make from a  European to an American conception of themselves. The book raised a  question- "How did a new sense of an American identity develop for a  people governed by Britian?"- and sought to provide a plausible  answer.  I would have enjoyed more historical identification of the events  depicted either as footnotes or end notes.  Yet, the author provided  helpful definitions of terms as footnotes 
 Richard Norton Smith provides a decent overview of Washington's presidency and, to his credit, gives a rounded portrait of Washington, with noble qualities and very human failings.  As straightforward history, though, Patriarch leaves much to be desired.  RNS references events without providing sufficient detail about them, such as the Nootka Sound incident, among several others.  Worse, his treatment of the Whiskey Rebellion is ridiculously one-sided, focusing exclusively on the Washington/Federalist point of view, and lacks basic factual information necessary for the reader to make an informed judgment about it.  Finally, RNS is clearly aiming for a readership of FoxNews viewers (assuming that FoxNews viewers actually read, of course) by throwing in gratuitous contemporary references, such as one to the "Blame America First" crowd, which are jarring and do nothing to advance the narrative.  RNS's subject and perspective (Washington as skilled politician and deep thinker) merit a much more comprehensive book than what we have here 
 This book is a broad and moderately detailed history of the development of the military bolt action.  For someone just getting interested in the subject, it would provide a useful general guide, but it lacks sufficient detail and depth to be useful as a reference for anyone other than the most casual collector.  In fact, I was quite dissapointed by the paucity of information related to actually collecting these rifles, given that that is what the book purports to be. If the book were titled as a history it would certainly have fulfilled my expectations, but even with that it is too expensive for what it delivers.  I returned mine 
 I think that if this had not been written by Andrew Holleran, it would not have been published.  It is not so much a novel as a collection of "thoughts" that are fairly sophmoric, if not trite.  I tried to finish it, but it kept on putting me to sleep.  I'd try this book instead of Ambien 
 Upon first removing it from the box I noticed that the set felt very fragile and it was. The cup broke (from a very slight bump) the first time I washed it, making the set useless. The top part, the teapot, is not very attractive on it's own and it dribbles when you pour it, so you can't really use it anywhere you don't want to mop up spilled tea. For me, this is a very disappointing waste of money. 
 somebody give this author and the readers who can take him seriously some smelling salts! they are obviously punch drunk, or simply delirious. wooooh, hoooohhhh 
 This DVD set consists of one outer and two inner Boxes, each has 4 glassy DVD case, 3 double, 1 single. DVDs are not indipendent in this set, so if you want to buy it used, beware of the condition of the box. some movies like "THE DOORS" and "Nixon" are originnaly two discs editions but only first discs are included in this dvd set and worse is, there is a word "disc 1" printed of them which indicates that these are the first DVDs of a 2 disc set and that makes you feel there is something crude about this box set! and there is something really crude! the quality of boxes and print is low. outer box could easily be damaged or worn and it's very loose. it's not a good deal, specially at the price of 116 dollars 
 I am a huge Danielle Steel fan, however this story could have been told in 75 pages. I feel it is one of her worst, Sorry Danielle! Just finished "The Kiss" and loved that one! 
 I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters. 
 This book was suggested reading as if " THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM" was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view 
 After reading several books about the Founding Fathers and other Presidents, I was excited to read about Teddy.  Now in most books they discuss personalities, events, and impacts of decisions.  This book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language.  There are lines that were shown as dialogue, when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence.  He writes about facial expressions during conversations.  Morris even wrote about what they thought during events.  Most writers would state, "He would recall later..."  If I had wanted to read a novel, I would have.  I was disappointed not with the subject, just the way it was written.   
 I bought this audio CD set at the Borders store, without the opportunity to preview the narration. Had I been able to do so, I probably never would have purchased it, let alone paid full bookstore price for it. But I needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day, so I relented.   Lesson learned.  The audio quality is very insonsistent, at at times very poor, having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording.   While the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the Middle East, it does read very much like a history text. With the amount of detail presented, and the wide scope of coverage from one end of Europe reaching into the former Soviet states and beyond, one immediately feels the need for visual aids (maps, timelines, etc.) as guidance.   The reader's narration is monotononous, with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses. Each sentence sounds the same as the last. This has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other, and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity. After a while, the narration becomes little more than background noise. No information is retained by the listener 
 And NO I do not agree that the lead female singer was brilliant. She has the same naisely "Disney Mermaid" qualities as everyone else of this generation. Not that I'm expecting Merman, but I grow so weary of witless lyrics and music, and singers who think "Linda Ronstant sings Gershwin" is a golden oldie 
 I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails 
 Rev. JJ and his son write a book about capitalism and how people can suceed in America. How does one of the U.S's biggest liberals going to tell people how to make money in America. The part where he Rev JJ says that Americans are better off quiting thier jobs and living off welfare  really took me back. Rev JJ promotes lazyness and corruption in America. HE SHOULD OF WRITEN A BOOK CALLED, REV. JJ'S TEN STEPS TO EXTORTION. " You to can have the power to rip people off.&quot 
 A sorry excuse for an album. This is not 'different' & wonderful; this is simply annoying noise. 
 ....for several reasons.  Apparently, the other online reviewers are extremely over-analytical in their critiques of this film.  The DVD's jacket has a quote from Rolling Stone..."Think 'Sex and the City' with men!"  Well, I say, "Think again."   As an avid watcher of "Sex and the City", this film has little if any comparison to SATC.  Firstly, this film is not a comedy.  There were very small instances when I kind of chuckled, but could barely muster a real laugh.  Actually, towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that I kept hitting FAST FORWARD on the remote (those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what I mean here!).  The characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person's life.  These disjointed glimpses don't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters.  Yes, they are all bored whether they are in their 30's or their 50's.  Yes, they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs.  I usually enjoy movies with this breaking-away-from-boredom type of plot for example...Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), Facing Windows (also starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno and a MUCH better film), Under the Tuscan Sun, Shirley Valentine, A Month by the Lake, etc. The Last Kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do, however.  The viewer is left with no warm feelings about life's decisions, only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film 
 Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.  Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts? no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a "barbie" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.  All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read. 
 A writer for the Irish Echo said this book should have been titled "The Protocols of the Elders of Erin."  It was written around the time Al Smith was running for president and appealed to the nativist, anti-Catholic prejudices of upstate New York and America at that time.  While there really were gangs in that era, most of New York's immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like St. Vincent's, Fordham, St. John's, Manhattan and Manhattanville.  The vast majority of the city's population including its immigrants didn't riot in 1863.  In fact New York City's 200,000 soldiers and sailors, more than half of whom were immigrants, won over 100+ Medals of Honor during America's Civil War.     It's a tribute to the persistence of prejudice that this book isn't more widely recognized as the nasty practical joke that it is 
 I have about two to three years of Knit N Style (2001 - 2003)Magazines, and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a Cardigan Pattern to Knit for myself.  I haven't found a single one.  All of the patterns have serious faults: Drop Shoulders, (totally unacceptable) little or no armhole, neck and/or shoulder shaping. Most sleeves have little or no cap. And, worst of all, they are all made in five or more pieces. Haven't any of these "designers" heard of Elizabeth Zimmerman?  I was going to give the lot to the library, but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place.  If you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people, why don't you teach them the PROPER way to knit?  Young people are smarter than you think 
 Fantastically irrational, false, warped, and harmful in almost every way and on every level 
 It's difficult to figure why anybody would bother using a poor 16mm print to transfer to DVD when there must be good 35mm prints out there, but this is another case of showcasing a very poor 16mm print. Otherwise, this is an excellent madcap film, but it doesn't start cooking until the Edgar Kennedy bartender scene, and Kennedy was absolutely masterful. From this scene on, the rest of the film is a romp. There was much luck with the sequences with Jacky the lion, so Sturges must have lived a charmed life. All the performances shine 
 a book of little not saying any use at all, it gives maybe just only one idea containted in it's title (but you don't have to buy the whole book to grasp the word) and for the same purpose you can find a better one by substracting the word modern of it  if you are anxious for a book, if not, I would recommend the web 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 As someone whose adult ADHD diagnosis changed and enriched my life, I feel called to write a reaction to this book.  I truly feel I am part of the increasingly small number of people who HAD A TRUE and ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS.  Also, at my employement, I work with a guy who is diagnosised autistic, and feel I know him fairly well.   In contrary to what I feel this book is saying, I have been incredibly baffeled as to what autisim is, or any understanding of it what so ever.  I even told my parents, "I think autism is the opposite of whatever ADHD is."  I don't think I have ever been as shocked to read something as when I came across this book.  What comes to mind, is that ADHD is actually a rare disorder/blessing that many non-ADD (as well as autistic) children and adults are being falsly diagnosed as.  ADHD has been as abused and misunderstood as much as the way most of our modern educational systems have been to the true ADDers themselves!  I am curious about more on this topic, and will be watching for it.  On a personal level, however, all intution tells me that that ADHD, and especially ADD, are being twisted and contorted farther and farther away from its original discovery and meaning!  
 this film had a few laughs but it never really got working for me.James Belushi always seems to get the sidekick role even in films where He is the Main star.it is a very cliched type of film but it has some moments 
 There is a good reason why this book is going used for 93 cents. Don't waste even that. I can't believe I bought this book. 
 A lot of examples in the book are absolutely wrong. Its more of a reference book than a text book. There are better books than this one if you really want to learn the material. The one book i would recommend is "Fundamentals of electromagnetics" by Fawaz Ulaby 
 I bought the Dirt Devil a few months ago. I read the reviews on it and despite some bad ones, I decided to go for it. How bad could it be...as long as it sucks up the dirt, right??? Well,                                                                                                                                                                                                     guess what? It doesn't even do that! Its awful on my rugs...I just want it to pick up the cheerios my children eat...instead, the vacuum takes the cheerio, breaks it up into smaller pieces and then spits it out the back! I have the same problem on my tile floors. If I vaccum the kitchen while barefoot, I can feel the dirt getting spit back out towards my feet!  I strongly strongly recommend NOT buying it. I am so disappointed and angry that I spent my money on this vacuum 
 I was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free. The manufacturer Computer Associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too. As for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl. After a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed 
 A lot of information on 1917 enfield.  This book has been around a while the first printing was in the 60s.  There has been some up dating but it needs a major over haul.  All of the pictures are from the 50s and 60s of shops that are not there anymore and of people that have long sense died. Of course some of the basics don't change if you are looking for information on semi autos this is not the place 
 This was my first introduction to Ian Rankin novels and I have to say that I'm not inspired to pick up another of the Rebus books. I found the continual name dropping irritating (The Who, The Stones, Geldof, Midge Ure, Bush, Blair and others) as they seemed to be thrown in for effect more than any real addition to the plot.  I realise that Rankin likes to set his stories in 'real time' and likes to use current affairs (and names) to do that but I don't think it was necessary, the events alone set it in July 2005.  The story itself dragged, with the plot seeming to be the G8 demonstrations more than anything else.  The murders were insignificant and I cared more about what happened to Siobhan's mum than anyone else!  If it's any consolation I found the last 40 pages more exciting than the first 380! 
 I was shipped the 12 inch size gasket which does not fit the 10 inch lid and needs to be returned. Please advise as to how I can exchange this for the proper size item 
 Although I would normally give 'Shadows in the Sun' 5 stars because it is a wonderful film, beautifully shot with some stunning landscapes of Tuscany, I can't help but give it 1 star for the dreadful pan-and-scan (4x3) DVD presentation forced upon Region 1 viewers.  Buena Vista Distributors should be hung, strung and quartered for releasing such a dreadful presentation on the US market and at a price of $29+ it proves that some studios are just plain greedy and hold their customers in contempt.  Surely they could have obtained the original anamorphic master digi-tape of the movie for US release.     The  good news is that the film was shot in anamorphic widescreen, (1.78:1 - enhanced to 16x9).  The bad news is that the NTSC version is pan-and-scan, presumably re-edited for TV.  They have 'forced commercial breaks' into the film, that's why there are so many 'fades to black' where the storyline does not justify them.  Before the end titles scroll up, the picture and vocal song fades to black, and a pan up to the sky and part of the vocal are lost.     Well, if you want to see the film in all its glorious anamorphic (16x9) widescreen presentation, with exceptional picture quality and color saturation, buy the Region 2 PAL version from amazon.co.uk.  The picture is so sharp you would think HD couldn't look any better!  The audio is somewhat superior too!  The disc also contains the same extras as the US version.  What a difference the correct screen ratio transfer can make to the complete enjoyment of a movie, in the way it was originally intended to be seen!  5 Stars for the movie - 1 star for the terrible NTSC Region 1 version 
 Robert A. Heinlein, a leading writer of science fiction, wrote "A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method."  In Stranger in a Strange Land, we're introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on Mars. These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF 
 In Chapter Nine, Deloria argues that white people were created by space aliens from the planet Nibiru, to work as slaves in the aliens' gold mines on Earth. If you can read such nonsense without guffawing, then this is the book for you.  Most thinking people will reject Deloria's simplistic division of the world into "red people" and "white people". Deloria's Manichean conception of Indian religion and Christianity is equally simplistic.  Fundamentally, Deloria wants to argue that Indians are racially superior to whites. Since he is afraid to come right out and express his racism openly, he hides it behind absurd spaceman theories, and behind claims that his stereotyped conception of Indian religion is superior to his stereotyped conception of Christianity.  Deloria presents his theory of space and time as if it were an original insight. He is simply warming over ideas that he half remembers from seminary, and inverting them to place Indian religion in the superior position over Christianity. The only thing original about Deloria's thesis is that he is using religion to argue for Indian superiority, whereas religion has historically been used to argue for white superiority. Inverting the bias does not make it any more acceptable. Racism is racism, no matter who is doing the hating.  White people created by space aliens, indeed! How did this racist nut job get to be the dean of Indian Studies in the American academy?  Deloria's stature doesn't speak well for the discipline, much less the academy.  
 I read this book right after Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It.  Let us look at the substance first. I applaud the author for many things. Among them, for not trying to stretch the amazingly thin plot over any more than 130 pages, which it takes comfortably. Second, for insinuating but not conferring the name of Sherlock Holmes on the old detective. To have flirted with accident but avoided a direct/dangerous hit has, I suspect, left the driver as well as the pedestrians healthy enough. I have hope that they will each continue on their journey with very little scarring and an unimpaired memory of their favorite detective.     As for style, for all those interested, I recommend both of Norman Maclean's books for a lesson on the exact meaning of brevity. True brevity  simply reduces the vehicle which carries the power of the story. Infact, the power becomes all the more starker for it. Poorly executed brevity cuts out power proportional to the removed verbage. Such is the case here. To all authors, taught and aiming brevity, I plead, in reducing the weight of the overcoat, do not lose the wool. Keep it warm and keep it alive.   The vocabulary is solid enough but feels like pepper sprinkled over a spoonful of cold, cold pasta. The words being, individually, pretty much the only admirable things, the novel is the highbrow pulling the lowbrow into its own world rather than walking over to the latter.  
 I ordered this item. I have bought directly from Baby Universe before, but now I've had several problems. I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe, I was told that the item was backordered.  They didn't know when it would be available. I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them.  It arrived fairly quickly, but was slashed through by a box cutter. I've been trying to get it exchanged, but their customer service is  lacking.  I won't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now.  I'm not so sure that I would buy from this company.  They seem to be slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle the amount of business they are getting.  Disappointing. Just got an RA number for the item, but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I'll get the item shipped to me.  They don't even give you the address to ship the returned item to.  Won't let me do a return.  This is a bad way to run a business 
 This very well may the shortest and cheapest books on parenting the only child, but I found it thin on the type of information that I was looking for. There are no fast fixes to parenting and I was hoping for more depth  in dealing with issues that were of great importance to me 
 This is a book written by one of the worst violator's of human rights.  He should be justly punished, perhaps with his own methods.  If one could look at it as Horror/fiction ala Stephen King, it could send a chill up your  spine 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 We can't add anything to Christianity, there are no more Gospels.  Nothing that we need to add, no stories we need to tell, or make up to explain who God is or what He thinks.  It is all before us.  He's told His story, He's revealed His character, and His Truth through the bible.  Glenda's book, to me, is half-baked.  She even admits she is no theologian.  Maybe that's where she should start with the bible herself, instead of making up stories about her conversations with God that are not biblically sound and contradict the Truth of who He is.  She puts way too much emphasis on the individual.  She stressed throughout her book that "we" are love, If we are Love, then why do we need a Savior.  If we are perfect why did He send His son to die for our sins?  Glenda's book is not one of Christianity, it is philosophy.  Self help, not surrender to a higher power.  She is promoting herself, her work.  We don't need her telling us what He thinks, He already has.  We ourselves, can go directly to the source.  He layed Himself out to us, fully exposed.  No hypothesizing necessary from authors like Glenda.  
 It seems to me that Jon Brion has a split personality as a musician.  On one hand, he is an austere and formal composer in the classical sense (see his brilliant symphonic score for Magnolia).  And on the other hand, he is a pop magician, creating hooks within a Beatlesesque format as a producer and songwriter.  With Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jon Brion taps into the latter musical personality, and given the context of a movie score, it feels ill-suited.  The scale of a movie score requires greater complexity in the composition than Brion's pop wizardry, as superlative as it is on albums by Rhett Miller, Aimee Mann, and the like, as well as on his own solo effort, Meaningless.  Most of the pieces on this soundtrack are mere shells of pop songs albeit with some winds and strings.  The difficulty and the sense of traditional musical history that informed the greatness of the Magnolia score is all but lost on this soundtrack.  As another reviewer commented, most of the pieces are extremely short, less than two minutes.  Jon Brion clearly has the brains.  So why not show it? 
 My son runs true to size on most clothing including Childrens Place but the PJs run very small and when I held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different.  At 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most PJs but already grown our of Childrens Place 6-9 mo PJs.  I bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear.  Buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on 
 The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness 
 Extracts constitute > 60% of the material in this book. Author's simplistic & subjective opinions make up the rest 
 I've read a number of novels chronicaling the south asian female experience, and I didn't find this story to be original at all, save for the "5 women traveling on a train" bit. It seems like Nair took all those other stories out there, put a new bow on it and published it. Each of the women's stories follow the same tragic, sad path. I kept waiting for, hoping for, well, the hope. I also found Nair's language trite and disconnected. At one instance, the main character is incredibly self-aware, in the very next she's crippled by fear and insecurity. I'll offer that perhaps this could be a translation issue? Not sure if this was orginally published in another language...I found a number of typos too (I think the last line of the book was a major typo - how does that happen?!?)  Overall, I'd say that if you're new to this genre, you'll probably find this interesting. If you've already read others in this genre (e.g., Anita Desai's books, Clear Light of Day, etc.), I'd soooo skip this one. Lots more compelling and original stories out there (Brick Lane, White Teeth, The Namesake -- they don't take place in India, but all incredibly compelling stories about the Asian experience). Hope this helps 
 this movie was soooo boring and not only that put even the ending didn't put means to the movie what a waste of seeing hte movie or even renting it trash 
 Reason once had two things going for it. It articulated principled libertarianism, and it was a consistently interesting magazine. Now its ideology is fuzzy; certainly not consistently libertarian. It is also dull and aimless, often badly written. Case in point: the current issue as I write includes a defense of the FDA by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians, and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements, as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry. The "old" Reason would never have published such a piece.  Nor would Reason have previously published Ronald Bailey's article advocating mandatory health insurance. Bailey also supports the Iraq war and psychiatric coercion. A bright spot continues to be the writing of Jacob Sullum 
 I just bought this for my children...  and it is nothing of I expected... it is way much better the baby move by fisher price and cheaper.  This one is boring in my opinion and even my kids...  Too bad I bought it 
 J.D. Salinger's last published work is more than 43 years old now, and still stirs many in the same absent way Seymour Glass animates his brother Buddy in this pair of stories first published in 1963. Are both cases of delusional devotion?  In the first story, "Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters," originally published in The New Yorker in 1955, we get what amounts to Salinger's first deep-dish treatment of the Glass family saga ("Zooey" saw print later, and previous stories featuring the Glasses were far less insular) as Buddy shows up for Seymour's wedding, only to find Seymour stood up his bride. In the second piece, 1959's "Seymour: An Introduction," Buddy foregoes any semblance of plot to explain who Seymour was.  Like a lot of other people, I am put off by the convoluted nature of "Seymour," as well as the explanations of those who defend it. Actually, there could be something to the idea of writing a plotless story, using characters like the Glasses people know from other works, but this is assuredly not it. Salinger too obviously indulges himself, spouting contempt at his generation and his critics, throwing up lame jokes and referencing obscure Japanese poets as a smokescreen to conceal his literary, intellectual, and metaphysical nakedness.  "What a marvelous convenience it would be if writers could let themselves describe their characters' clothes, article by article, crease by crease," Salinger writes in the role of Buddy, pretty much summing up the approach of "Seymour" as well as its underlying failure. His interest in his subject is not only all-consuming, it is not all that deep.  "Raise High" is a better story, though that's not saying much. "Franny And Zooey," the previously published Salinger book, also combined a better story with a weaker one, but there at least you got one terrific story in "Franny," a bold, empathetic tale of power and focus. "Raise High" doesn't know where it's going, and is in no hurry to get there. You get nice asides, like when Buddy sees an old chair and remembers a beloved bulldog, long dead, who slept there and left his chewmarks. There's also some arresting ambiguity, as when Buddy reads Seymour's journal and we get maybe a suggestion of unease at some apparent insanity.  But "Roof Beam" doesn't end so much as fizzle away, with Buddy snoozing in an empty apartment after the mystery of Seymour's absence has been resolved via an unseen phone call. Emptyness is a recurrent theme in Salinger's Glass writings, here as in "Franny & Zooey," where various Glasses are often seen in isolation thinking or writing about absent kin. For such a happy family, there's an overwhelming sadness about the Glasses that suggests Salinger found himself in a bit of a dead end with them, one from which he never emerged. Further evidence of this can be found in the web-available "Hapsworth 16, 1924," Salinger's last public blast, published in The New Yorker in 1965.  Salinger was one of the most important American writers of our lifetime, not to mention a seminal figure of our culture, but his greatness lies elsewhere, not here. Read this only if you are a Salinger completist, or else interested in the price genius can extract from its recipients 
 This is Kaufman's first novel. His previous publications include a memoir (Jew Boy), a poetry book and a few anthologies. Kaufman admits to being a "binational, Israeli and American." As an Israeli he did time in the Israeli army or more properly Israel Defense Forces, giving him the experience necessary to draw on for this glimpse into a soldier's life.   The title, Matches, is a nickname the officers gave the soldiers, "one-strike flames that burned up and died." It is narrated from the perspective of Nathan Falk. An American Jew, who feels alienated at home in New York, has chosen to fight along his Jewish comrades in the Israeli army. Living on Time cigarettes, French fries and mud coffee he leads two lives, the one he has in Gaza and the one he has in Jerusalem. Were it not for the constant reminders from fellow soldiers that he is a Yankee he'd probably forget.   In Gaza, no one likes the Israeli army or its soldiers. Everyone they come across glares at them with "an undisguised look of hatred." When he is on leave in Jerusalem he spends his time in bed with another man's wife, a beautiful red-head named Maya, an artist with psychological problems Nate isn't equipped to handle. Some of them brought on by his need to control and withhold despite saying "she was all that I care for".   What I liked about this book was the view it provided outside the usual media propaganda. It looks into the culture of Israel from two perspectives. One, although briefly, from the somewhat safe stronghold of Jerusalem and the other from the frontline of Gaza. It was a difficult read on many levels especially since my reading seemed to coincide with Israel's recent turmoil but it did help me to understand more about what is going on; although I might not always accept it.   What ruined it for me were the in-depth side stories about a man defecating in the street; a sea of rotting horses, camels and goats; cutting off the ears of a dog and feeding it to him; and the horse that fell on a land mine. By the time I finished it I was just happy it was over. Some may think I'm losing the point of the story but I mention this only for those who would not want to read such content (in detail) which in this instance is more offensive than the rest of the story.   It dates itself with some of the language, like "Jerry Bruckheimer fireball". There's no real sense of a conclusion by the end. Nathan is still a soldier; the fighting continues and people keep dying on both sides. Nathan hasn't learned anything since the beginning of the book; he just keeps on keeping on with no real purpose other than being a soldier.   What I would have liked to have seen is an appendage or two; like a mini weapons diagram to reference the numerous weapons mentioned throughout for those with no frame of reference. A map of the region would also have been helpful.   Matches is not high on my list of recommendations but if you're curious about the life of one Israel soldier from the perspective of someone who has lived on both sides this may whet your appetite for more. If you have any sensitivity to animals being hurt, skip it. Review written by M. E. Wood 
 We bought this book for our daughter for her 1st birthday.  We had to take it away from her almost immediately because one of the pages has a sheep on it and she was able to eat pieces of the cotton off of the sheep 
 This book is not even worth turning the first page!  This is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author.  The book is poorly researched, poorly written, poorly edited, and well...... words just fail me.  While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him, Herriot his due, the man could write well and could tell a great story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?).  This guy though, Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding the paper into his typewriter!  The entire book is such a obvious ploy to make some quick money on the shirttail of a "dead" but popular author it is rather nauseating.  Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work!  I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, my thinking being with each turn of the page "well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter."  How wrong I was!  If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of the library.  I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly  would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this.  Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject.  I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually.  We certainly did not get it here.  I just hate having to give this one even one star.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK

 Without a doubt this is the biggest piece of crap I have ever read. I couldn't get past the 2nd or 3rd chapter. Long, overly involved, overly complex, and just plain old stupid. This is exactly the kind of thing that makes you embarassed to admit you love comic books, and this is exactly the reason DC tanked in the 80s and needed to be revived by Batman and Gaiman's Sandman in the late 80s. Read only if looking for simultaneous cures for insomnia and sanity. This was nothing more than a waste of my time and brain-space. 
 This one is junk.  It does detect metal 1/8" deep.  We buried 2 coins a 1/4" deep in our sand box.  Now I have to stop my 5 year old from screaming that we lost 2 quarters.  Guess it is time to get the BIG shovel and sifter and find those quarters 
 There is an odd conceit found in many otherwise intelligent people to the effect that as they're brilliant on one field, they must be brilliant in EVERY field, especially as other fields must be trivially simple in copmparison with the one they're in. Hence we see doctors losing fortunes in the stock market, scientists losing money in business ventures, a generally smart people making asses of themselves in every way possible.  Penrose' argument can be boiled down into a very few simple assertions:  1. Mathematicians appear to derive proofs in a way that is not describable in the algorithmic language of computation.   2. The only processes we know that are not so describable are quantum processes.  3. Ergo the way mathematicians derive proofs, and by extension cognitive processes in general, must involve quantum processes, which for some reason he locates in the microtubles of neurons.   Now I don't know much about quantum mechanics, but I do know a fair bit about cognition and neurophysiology, and I can safely say that Penrose is talking hooey from his first assertion on. He's made a very clumsy error in looking at mental processes that occur a level not open to concious introspection, and then assuming that because individuals cannot describe these processes, they are not describable using the language of ordinary logic.  Everything else in the book derives from that simple error- an error I'd hope a second year Psych student wouldn't make. If he'd shared his manuscript with at least one psychologist, maybe this would have been pointed out to him, but again, perhaps that's just that conceit rearing its head again; how could a mere psychologist hope to understand the work of a briliant mathematician? ;-)  If you're looking for a good book that will explain cognition once and for all, I don't think it's been written yet. Certainly not by Penrose 
 Very hard to read and understand. Each chapter has Learning Objectives and those LO's are referenced for the questions at the end. The problem is: inside the chapter there is no way to find out what the LO's are!!! Me and a friend tried to figure it out but it was almost impossible. A lot of the chapter questions were very difficult. Several spelling errors that a sixth grader could have found. I had a Managerial Accounting class twice, once as a prerequisite for my graduate degree and I am taking it now for my MBA. Imagine my horror when I discovered that I was using this same book twice. I hope you never get stuck with this turkey of a book 
 This book basically goes through what the options are under file, edit, view, etc. The help menu in the program would suffice for this. It also does not go through enough examples of when you would use the options 
 What a disappointment to come across this chronicle of a religious delusion by such a bright and promising ufologist. The Case for NASA UFOS dvd was awe inspiring, and David's analysis and passionate emphasis on the reality of ufos is excellent.  I was a bit shocked to see that he wrote this book premised upon the visitation of a non-existent fictional person such as "Jesus Christ", who symbolizes the binding of earth humans to the wheel of ignorance and superstitious belief.  I recommend that everyone read "Star Wisdom" by Gene Andrade for a primer, "The Talmud of Immanuel" concerning the earthly prophet Immanuel who's mission here was fictionalized and distorted and falsely represented in the contrived "Jesus Christ" myth, and to further investigate the "Meier Contacts" for more specific information and solid evidence ([...]) 
 Well, it seems anti-catholicism is everywhere these days.  First John Cornwell's "Hitler's Pope" now this wonderful book.  I guess the "enlightened" people of the Nobel Prize commitee must not be as smart as we thought.  After all, they actually gave Mother a Nobel Peace Prize. I suppose Martin King and Albert Einstein must have been frauds too, or perhaps Hitchens (like Cornwell) may a few facts crossed.  I'm just glad there is a generation of Catholic Apologists who can shed light on this type of "investigative jouirnalism" 
 I found that this book was not what I expected.  I was looking for a reference for fine art sketching and painting.  This is more appropriate for graphic art--cartoons etc 
 This book is comprised of the kind of writing Sockel calls "thick clotted prose". After decades of reading the clear, unadorned, precise and excellent English of The Economist, I have become intolerant of pretentious layered jargon. What, for example, does this sentence say, which could not be said in simple words: "The organization's objectives, responses, and business models should be calibrated on the basis of its capabilities." Perhaps it could have been: "Organizations should do things they are good at." If this thick clotted prose had coagulated into high scholarship, I might have bothered to read on. Alas, that was not the case. The authors write, in a gesture alluding to scholarship: "Evidence shows that customers are demanding clearer information from their solution providers..." What evidence? It was not given, nor references to studies showing it. Read this book to find out how not to write.   Better still, get yourself a good book on this topic. See "Cultivating Communities of Practice" by Wenger at al., from Harvard Business School Press. Here you shall find lucid expression, good English, thorough endnoting and source documentation, and a comprehensive treatement of the topic. 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 I was actually a client of Dr. Shapiro's and he is only interested in one thing-MONEY!  He has made a nice living for himself with his books, but the nutritional education he offers is minimal and his books don't really offer anything but a fad diet.  He drained my pockets, offered me disgusting powders as meal supplements and to top it off I did not lose more than 5 pounds during my entire two months as his patient.  I followed his diet religiously everyday with zero result.  I never reached my goal weight.  I have since been successful after joining Weight Watchers and a local gym.  Trust me, this book is NOT worth the money (not even for free) and I would have been better off spending my money at Barney's (across the street from his office in New York) 
 The Adkins diet works because decreasing your carb intake decreases your calorie intake and it also works by your body loosing significant fluids secondary to increased urine excretions of ketones (from fat burning) and nitrogen (from use of protein for energy rather than the body's first choice of glucose from carbs).  Problems related to this diet include:  * increased protein diets heavily burden the kidneys to excrete exessive amounts of nitrogen which has been shown to lead to loss of renal (kidney) function with aging.  *Inadequate carb intake compromises glycogen storage in liver and muscles (the body's 1st choice for energy source) risking fatigue and poor performance  *Protein in excess of need is used for energy (but if you are fatigued from lack of carbs you wont use the energy), the other protein is converted to fat, and its a well known health risk to have an increased body fat %  * Also, high protein is associated with increased urinary excretion of calcium, and may therefore contribute to osteoporosis.  * High intake of animal proteins are linked to atherosclerosis (related to saturated fat and cholesterol content) and to colon and prostate cancers.    Honestly this diet is not healthy for you at all. Eating a well balanced diet and regularly getting excercise will help you stay healthy and can remove you from the burden and cost that all of these fad diets offer. No matter how Mr. Adkins died doesn't matter... what matters is that you have a choice to make good decisions about your health and realize that sometimes these fad diets are too good to be true and we could be putting ourselves at risk by believing they are the answer to our problems. 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 This was not as good as I had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while I am working out but the rest is good. 
 Everything's a conspiracy these days! This book, though, goes FAR beyond  the X-Files paranoia. One simple example of the author's credibility is  evidenced in his 'Chronology' where he cites Jesus as possibly travelling  "...to India, Tibet and Britain to be initiated into the esoteric  traditions of East and West." As often seen in this type of work,  Freemasonry takes most of the blame and the author's bibliography is a  veritable treasure-trove works customarily used by anti-Masons to prove  their point. If you want more to justify worrying about that light in your  refrigerator or those black helos, this is the book to buy 
 I have to read this book for an ap course in school, and I found the book to be really boring. It's good information, but it's very difficult to read and stay focused. It reads like a textbook

 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 I picked up Scene & Structure, despite misgivings about the author, because I enjoyed Characterization & Viewpoint (Orson Scott Card) and Beginnings, Middles and Ends (Nancy Kress).  These books were a rich vein from which to draw for writers of any age or experience level.  I still reread Card's entry at least once every five or six months, to ensure I'm getting the most out of his tips.  Bickham's work in Scene & Structure has given me questions about buying any other books in Elements of Fiction Writing, however.  There are a lot of problems with the book.  To begin with, Bickham uses a variety of bits of terminology that are, at the least, odd.  Ordering readers to have a "disaster at the end of every scene", and to "use sequels to bridge the gap between two scenes" is a bit problematic when you haven't described what a "sequel" or "disaster" constitutes.  Perhaps you noticed I used the term "ordering" up there; that's another issue.  Bickham writes like a sledgehammer, or perhaps a drill sergeant.  There is no room for variation in his mind, and any deviations from his rules which he even acknowledges he discards as "not recommended".  The problem isn't that Bickham isn't skilled at what he does; he writes fiction in the style of Dan Brown or Robert Ludlum and does it better than Brown or Ludlum generally do.  But it's thriller style writing and his rules aren't remotely applicable to any other genre, much less literary writers 
 otherwise, I was bored to tears.  I kept closing the book to look at the photo and found more to it than all the words inside the book 
 I wish I hadn't wasted money on this book. It just tells how two sighs will interact with each other. The book is so thick because it lists the combination of every zodiac sign and how they would interact with each other. It also does each combination as male or female. For example I'm a Leo and the person I chose to look up is a Cancer it lists how a Leo woman and a Cancer man would interact, it also lists how a Leo man and Cancer woman will react and it lists how ever sign would interact with every other sign just like that. If that's what you want the buy this book but it really seems like a waist of money to me 
 This novel was unfinished and needed some cleaning up.  We never learn how he comes to leave Robinson and Delamarche, for instance, or whatever becomes of his money the manageress is holding for him. It is obvious that the work was not ready for publication.  That said, for those who are interested in reading Kafka the book is light and amusing at times.  But overall, the situations Karl finds himself in are often frustratingly impossible and the characters are not well developed.  Karl, the main character makes an excellent argument for the Stoker in Chapter One, but can't seem to find words for his own defense at the Hotel. There are enough inconsistancies to drive an analytical reader crazy and probably Kafka wouldn't have allowed publication in this unfinished form 
 I found this book (I listened to the audio version) to be a major disappointment. The tips offered by Carnegie may have appeared insightful and provocative to assembly line supervisors back in the 1930s, but in the more enlightened 21st century a lot of his "good advice" comes across as irritatingly simplistic and sometimes even downright condescending and offensive. It's so easy and straightforward: Be nice to people, remember their first names, always be positive and you will instantly be liked by everyone. Overly obvious and trite - hardly the kind of stuff that would find its way into today's Harvard Business Review. Adding to the sense of irritation is the voice of the reader who tries to sound upbeat and optimistic, giving the whole performance the hollow feel of amateurish propaganda better suited to "Pleasantville" than to "Wall Street".   For more insightful, relevant and up-to-date advice, I recommend "How to become CEO" by Jeffrey J. Fox 
 Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That  made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end 
 The cover model (or firefighter) is beautiful, sexy, and provocative. One may think this video has much to offer. Well, no, it's not. Even if the mission and vision of putting together this calendar may be noble (Firefighter Fundraising - we often think back to 9/11, and the many lives we have lost, among others).   The video is boring and truly disappointing. It just doesn't flow and, unfortunately, it is not in tune with the message the cover is trying to send. If you feel generous you rather send a donation to the firefighters directly. Do not waste time and expectations buying this video. It's not worth it 
 Don't bother buying this phone unless you want to waste your money. We're replacing them and our are only 6 mo. old. Terrible interference, inferior batteries, no range what-so-ever. This is the first and last Uniden product we'll ever have purchased 
 While De Zengotita's ideas are all fine, his writing style is much too convoluted and very often it's difficult to figure out what he is trying to say.  He jumps around a lot and it seems as if he's rambling too much and that there isn't much organization to the book.  I did learn a lot from his ideas, which I thought were great, but his writing was quite terrible 
 I was hoping for an over-the-top mix performance with Tiesto's signature touch on the blends and some terrific tracks. I got half of that with this 2 DVD set.  The one thing that was satisfying was the lighting and some of the special FX that the concert had, but as other reviewers would agree, the awesome ALL DIGITAL richness of the video recordings that took place were ruined by this constant switching of cameras and angles when they edited all of the 8 hours into 3.   The concert on the small screen: As a DJ I totally bought the additional "camera angle" that the box described. I really wanted to be glued to what the DJ was doing and just get a glimpse at his reactions, etc...  Well, the second angle only takes place on certain parts of the DVD, and its still full of camera changes that just won't let you enjoy the scenery. I would have rather have a 2-hour DVD with 1 or 2 different "still" angles and the normal concert track on another. This is just some of my complaint from the visual perspective of watching the DVD.  The performance: As Tiesto controls 3 Tech 1200's, 1 Pio DJM-600 and 2 Pio CDJ-1000's he shows his "Larger Than God" showmanship with outstretched & waving arms over and over again (although deservingly so, he has 25,000 people dancing!) but yet we can truly see his humble persona as well (specially on the 2nd special features DVD). The camera changes angle at every second but you can feel a little bit of his excitement with over 30 cameras present and like 10 of them just around in the DJ Booth. DJ's, don't get excited, you really can't see anything exciting.  Performance-wize I expected more serious mixing and the kind of energy that you get from his mixes live or at a party, but the fact is that this is a concert, not a rave or club gig for Tiesto. The show (and the mix) comes to a hault several times as the theme of the concert being a "Journey Around the World" switches scenery from one continent to the other. You go from Brasil to Australia in 3 hours with Tiesto changing t-shirts every time and with some pretty lame-ish live acts that were probably better when watched in the concert. Don't give me wrong, I like the idea of incorporating live acts with a DJ's performance, but these were acts that just did not match very well and sadly were not produced appropirately. Bad choreography.  The Audio: The biggest let-down to me was the fact that the music and crowd noises did not match what I was seeing most of the time. Even worse, some video clips were repeated with different songs! Half an hour into the DVD and I knew I was in for a sonic let-down as the music was just not quite what I expected and the way the concert was edited just made you feel like "something's not right". Maybe its just the fact that from being a DJ I am being too hard on this, but I know I have seen concerts done way better than this and I am surprised to see this kind of post-production work for a DJ like Tiesto.  The Second DVD: The making of the concert was a nice piece of material, letting you see more of Tiesto's personality and the innerworkings of the concert, but you better be good at reading subtitles because thats all you get! I had to watch this twice to appreciate the making of the concert fully.  Apart from this you get some special features which to me are not worth anything.  Bottom Line: If you are Tiesto's biggest fan than you already have this DVD, if you don't have it than just save the dough and wait until he comes near your town because the $30 you are about to drop on this mediocre production are better spent seeing/feeling him rock the party in a club. Either that or check his most recent concert DVD (Single Disc), it might be better.   Good luck with your purchase 
 Not a book for beginners, since it is extremely confusing and poorly organized. You have to deeply study the book in order to get any benefit as opposed to reading it. The presentation and the drawings are all jumbled up and hard to follow. NOT WORTH I

 The author gets song names wrong, photo captions wrong, and jumps all over the place chronologically 
 This series is really showing its age.  The selection this year is particularly poor, with very few exceptions.  The problem is that both Collins and Lehman prefer a kind of watered-down, anecdotal style rather than truly challenging work. Too many names are repeated from past BAPS.    Somthing must be done to alter this formula and give this series new life, because it really could be a great thing.    
 I had to read this book for a Multicultural Literature class at my Uni, and, far from being informative, all it did was fill with me a contempt of my own. I am not a racist by any means, but when confronted with such a bitter, snide voice as the one Kincaid displays, I find myself unconsciously getting defensive. When she says, "you are a tourist; you are ugly," I find myself saying, "Fine, I'll keep my money and let you trade with seashells and beads." Kincaid is a master of the self-fulfilling prophecy: she says Antiguans are so oppressed and so downtrodden and so angry, and rather than doing anything to help it, she's exacerbating it by using such a bitter, over-the-top voice.   Other reviewers have stated that the vision of Antigua portrayed is a warped and extremely limited one, biased by Kincaid's apparent small mindedness, and I must confess that I'm glad to hear that. To think that the entire island is solely occupied by bitter people who imagine themselves to be ex-slaves would make me steer clear of the area any time I go on vacation.   Because, yes, I am a tourist. And no, being a tourist does not automatically make anyone ugly, despite what Kincaid's bitter rant might say. 
 I came here looking for a book that might explain the background to what happened in Cambodia. But i can only conclude Becker covered this turmoil from the her apartment's balcony. This has to be one of the most lifeless products of a typewriter keyboard that I have ever read. Maybe that's too harsh, but I know I didn't find the answer to anything I was looking for. Who did she write this for, herself 
 I came across McCarry after reading Mark Steyn's claim that he was another real ex-spook novelist and better than LeCarre.  Well, lots of things are better than recent LeCarre, but at least to judge by this book McCarry is a journeyman writer who doesn't come close to comparing to LeCarre in his prime.    Yes, his intelligence background lends surface realism to his descriptions of a hunt from one end of the world to the other-- the part set in a remote corner of China where Kafka meets Genghis Khan is especially convincing and amusing.  But too much of this covers standard airport novel stuff-- the old (by now very old) Nazi in South America, the way-too-much-to-swallow-mystery (which covers all the ground from ancient Judea to Osama bin Laden-- by way of Heydrich's Czechoslovakia!), the band of retirees assembled to solve it all who fall somewhere between Doc Savage's Fantastic Five and one of those aging-actor-work-program movies like The Wild Geese.  The real point is that McCarry is telling a plot-- a whopper of one-- and can only tell it by sending his main character from one part of the world to the next where, conveniently, someone who we are told will tell him nothing promptly tells him everything.  LeCarre, on the other hand, uses the dilemmas of spying to explore character.  The mystery in Tinker, Tailor could hardly be smaller (one's a mole, which one is it?) yet it's vitally involving.  The mystery in Old Boys could hardly be bigger yet it's-- oh, that old thing again.  Whatever 
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

        This book was tiresome reading at times, with many mathematical tables of which were put in the book to provide an alibi for whomever might disagree with the man and how he came to the conclusions he had done. I must agree with one of the reviwers of this book --- " Who cares?". I mean ultimately, it will be the readers themselves that will judge what exactly was the greatest and productive findings in history.   The Techonologically inclined will say that Science is the master of all that is and the more liberal arts type will insist that the Arts is what defines a culture. The fact is that both do because both hold a sea-saw effect, without imagination there is no science and without science there is no reason for a human being to think beyond what reality tells him to be so. It is science that produces better paints, better materials that lets the Artist craft and produce --- so why pit them against eachother?    It is that point that I will give this particular book 2 stars, as well as the way it was made. The side notes in a terrible headache making Blue with white type was a horrible idea. The reading was very drawn out and I've read better on far more drier  material.  The fact the guy took a good few years of his life to do this seems kind of odd, and I question it --- one should wonder, why? Somone could have made the arguement that the West had a far more promenint mark on the world in far fewer pages and time then this particular author has done. 
    Good photography and camera work! Writing was poor and I found the movie to be a great waste of good acting talent from good actors! Although the movie was meant to be a horror flick I personally don't like it when evil rules and the devil wins in the end. Other than that the constant negativity was occasionally well glossed over with some fine nudity. I will be giving my copy away. I probably should burn it 
 I am stunned that a book like "Lightning" would sell even one copy.  Mine was given to me, but should have been tossed in the trash instead.  I cannot begin to talk about what is wrong with this book because there is nothing right. Worthless!!!!and pathetic and beyond.  For heaven sake if you are really of fan of Steel's (I find that hard to believe) than check it out of the library, do not waste a dime on this trash. "Lightning" discredits all women and is a sham.  It does not deserve even one star 
 The plot was very good, but I could not tell who was talking and who was being talked to during most of the book.  As an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading an easy-to-read, entertaining book before getting back to something heavier.  Boy was I wrong - I am not accustomed to so much dialogue confusion.  The book was poorly written and I do not recommend it to anyone. 
 If you are really interested in what happened between Turks and Armenians in 1915,i can suggest you to read Heath Lowry's The Story Behind Ambassador Morgenthau's Story.Professor Heath Lowry is a well-known historian in Princeton University and in his book,he proves Ambassador Morgenthau's Story wrong scientifically,shows how the book is based on rumors.A must to read for those who are interested in this matter.. 
 Extreme behaviour? I think not.  Perhaps extremely bad lyrics.  Was this dude stoned when he wrote the lyrics or really that shallow?  I just love that romantic song that they play on the radio all the time about the dude that's cheating on his girl friend w/ another woman and they dare to call it lips of an angel?  Could it get any sicker? I think the song should be retitled Welcome to Hell 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 I originally had to read this book for a History of Rock and Roll class at the University of Cincinatti. I found the subject interesting, and the professor gave wonderful lectures. I had good expectations about this book going in, but those quickly soured as I read it.  It seems correct, at least, about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock. Not that such is a particularly daunting feet.  However, it is rife with laughable fallacies. For instance, it calls David Bowie, amongst other glam rock bands of the era, metal. It futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock, when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all, such as the Carpenters.  I really had a good laugh when they called Bad Religion hardcore. Bad Religion is about as hardcore as Elvis is rap. Further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book.  I also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs. For instance, it claims 'Thunder Rolls' by Garth Brooks is about domestic violence. Its about infedility, not focusing on violence at all, but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on.  The writing is also rather dry. Many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence. It also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band's successes or failures.  After reading the book in completetion, I really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues (50s to 60s) that I had thought were true. In the end, I felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything 
 Personally I found the style of this book irritating. Its 100% hand written text and cartoons, which don't provide a lot of detail and the jokes were lame. The information is not incorrect - I just found it didn't have enough detail to replicate the moves. And its old... eg, the importantance of pedals with toe clips! Best left for the kid 
 I consider myself a huge pixar fan. This is easily the most insipid Pixar movie ever. Pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one. I have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie. Pixar, if you are listening, please, please, dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c-grade stuff. I expect more from you 
 This is one Pitt novel you should skip.  I kept waiting for the plot to grab my attention, and now that I've finished the book, I'm still waiting 
 I've enjoyed Stephen Fry's work as an actor and comedian, and looked forward to my first crack at one of his books. But "The Hippopotamus", while loaded with clever lines, completely failed as a novel for me because of the author's intense desire to shock the reader and thus "prove" his superiority. Fry apparently believes he has accomplished this with a plot involving bestiality, but he is unable to sustain the kind of intense focus it would take to really explore the dark world of mental delusion he temporarily assigns to one of his characters, an adolescent boy. By the end (SPOILER coming up; stop reading if you don't want to know), everything has reverted to a happy, sunny world. The boy who suffered the delusions has instantly forgotten them and, even more inexplicably, a complete cipher of a character has agreed to go on a date with the narrator, despite the fact that his idea of attracting a woman is to promise to "lick her like a lolly". Fry really gives away his underlying lack of grit when he equates a liking for McDonald's hamburgers with mental health. (Mickey D's advertising sure works well.)   It's too bad that Fry's goal of being shocking supersedes his interest in creating believable characters and situations, because he definitely has talent as a writer. His style is engaging and intelligent. I may try one of his other books, but I can't recommend this one 
 This book will be a lovely addition to my compost heap.  I couldn't find any sense in the character's motivations so the whole mess became a simple, predictable voyage through a hamlet that any five-year-old could have dreamt up.  When coming across this one on the shelf, my advice is to keep on browsing 
 The usual anti tradition garbage. Little biography here more of a thesis of liberal pope=good pope traditional pope=evil pope. Bad biography, any real church historian knows John XXIII never wanted the garbage that happend after vatican II i.e. he never even wanted a mass in the vernacular. If you like real catholicism and beauty ( or for that matter are looking for a bio of John xxiii) then skip this book, If you want a book about why churches should continue to look like empty garages and homilies should be given by a butch nun about how we need to call jesus she then this ones for you 
 Type Cooper's name into Google and learn about what a nut job he really was.  He allegedly threatened a neighbor with a hand gun.  A court issued an arrest warrant.  When two deputy sheriffs attempted to serve the warrant he shot one of them.  They returned fire, killing him 
 Although it kept time (which indicates the batteries were good) this didn't work the first day I used it. It worked the second day. It stopped working by the third day AND the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost. This was a complete waste of $19 
 This book was not written by Hayek. It was written by editor and confidant W.W. Bartley when Hayek was sick and incapacitated. The only parts written by Hayek were just random notes that only show up in the appendices 
 I need to admit that when something out there gets terrible reviews, I must see, read, or listen to what that something is in order to see what the fuss is about. Caitlin Flanagan's book "To Hell with All That" got some absolutely stinking reviews, so it didn't take much to perk my curiosity.  And this book deserved every one of those bad reviews simply because, as I was reading the book, I got the undeniable impression that Flanagan just doesn't know what she's talking about. She starts the book by making a pedestrian observation that big, white weddings are back to being trendy. Then she blames the feminist movement for single-handedly crippling the sex-lives of couples all over the nation, followed by some incredibly ambiguous argy-blargy about the virtues and vices of doing housework. This same feminist-hating, 'at-home' mother delves headlong into self-pity as she recounts her experience with a long-time nanny for her twin sons. As the narrative limps and hobbles toward the end, she takes time to fawn over Martha Stewart's overnight success by glorifying menial housekeeping chores. And then she saves the grand-slam for last: she summons a misty-eyed story of her bout with and eventual recovery from breast cancer.  When I visit the ratings for this book on Metacritic, I'm glad that I'm not the only one who things this is a strange way to conclude a book written by a woman who set out to scathe her fellow hard-working sisters. But even if you were to discard the concluding chapter, you really don't know what to make of the book. Non of it adds up to any kind of effective argument-ending thesis, which is probably what Caitlin Flanagan was shooting for.  The most annoying thing about "To Hell With All That" is that, like so many other people who stubbornly hide behind their politics, Flanagan attacks everything in a one-sided/black vs. white manner. It's akin to one who identifies themselves as a conservative simply because they hate liberals. Although I have never taken a course in woman's studies myself, I realize that the feminist/liberation movement happened for a reason. It most likely was not a fluke since it touched the minds of women the world over and its legacy continues as we entertain the idea that, hey, someday a woman could be an American president. Alas, Caitlin Flanagan sees the whole movement as an knee-jerk reaction that has left children feeling abandoned and husbands unsatisfied in the bedroom.  It doesn't help that Flanagan sees the world through a rich-girl's looking glass, but you can't fault someone for the social status into which they are born. But I can blame her for preaching to the choir, as her manifestos for being at home with the kids being available to the husbands are luxuries that she and a few friends can afford (along with the nanny and a gardener and a babysitter and an, this kills me, "organizer").  That fault is further magnified when Caitlin Flanagan insists on speaking on behalf of their entire feminine population. She's constantly tossing around strong claims such as "women are naturally drawn to these things [cooking, cleaning, changing diapers]." Hey Caitlin, let's see your data set. Oh, that's right, your book has no data!   In fact, most of "To Hell with That" is Caitlin Flanagan just projecting her general attitudes on motherhood and housewifery up to a universal level. If she would admit to something like that, and maybe would have conducted some honest studies, I might give the arguments more credence. Between my wife and I, I probably embody more of a feminist attitude (I win by default because she simply doesn't care). It's one thing to disagree with a book's ideology, but "To Hell with All That" turned me off because of careless generalization and a condescending writing style. In hindsight, the title of the book fits my attitude of the book perfectly 
 Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page.  That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from 
 How disapointing after more than 20 years of reading to have it all end in this fashion, typical of Steven King.  I was hoping he would give this story his best effort, but instead it seems he just wanted to be done with it. As a long time King fan, I hate to diss this book, but cannot give high marks for this one.  Inserting himself into the story lost all credibility for me.  I wish I had stopped reading the series at book 4 or 5 as my imagination created several ending senarios that were better than the actual 
  In the first line of his 1971 work, Eduardo Galeano clearly states, "the division of labor among nations is that some specialize in winning and others in losing." (Page 1)  For Galeano, the economic well being of the United States and Europe rested on the back of Latin America.  First pillaged for its gold and silver, then for it's human resources, Latin America served as the foundation for capitalist interests.  This is the thesis for the book, and the author spends over 300 pages expounding on the "horrors" and "injustices" that the western world has plagued on Latin America.  "Latin America's industry," the author writes, "lies at the bottom of the Imperium's digestive apparatus.  Our union makes their strength to the extent that our countries, not having broken from the molds of underdevelopment and dependence, integrate their own respective serfdoms." (Page 254)  This, according to Galeano, resulted in the dividing up of Latin America's population into disjointed nation states, as each section of the countryside was developed to capitalize on one resource.  "Today," Galeano writes, "any of the multinational corporations operate with more coherence and sense of unity than the congeries of islands that is Latin America." (Page 260)      In presenting his argument Galeano divides his book into three parts.  Mankind's Poverty as a Consequence of the Wealth of the Land, Development Is A Voyage With More Shipwrecks Than Navigators, and an update to the original work added in 1977 simply titled, Seven Years After.  Unfortunately Galeano provides a very one-sided overview of Latin American history from the time of Columbus to the late 1960s.  Within the first section's three chapters, the author paints a greed driven picture of Spanish explorers bent on finding gold at all cost, followed by European, and then American exploiters, manipulating the sugar and coffee industry for their own gains at the cost of the native peoples.  While spending a large amount of text in describing the first Spanish expeditions, Galeano neglects to mention the then current situation among the Native American Indians.  He never mentions the ambiguous relationships that certain Indian cultures had with their own neighbors, or the fact that the Aztecs were oppressing their own people.  No mention is given at all to the fact that Cortes had help from neighboring tribes in the overthrow of the Aztec Empire. The Indians are portrayed as simple peace loving people.      Galeano also seems to make assumptions that do not stand the test of time.  In writing about the Spanish-American War and the acquisition of Puerto Rico the author states, "at the same time the Philippines and Puerto Rico dropped into the United States' lap." (Page 71)  He then goes on to expound, in a footnote almost half the page long, the horrors the people of Puerto Rico have faced (no say in Congress, trade controlled, Puerto Ricans drafted to fight in Vietnam) as a "colony" of the United States.  He fails to point out, and as time has shown, that since the late 1970s Puerto Rico has been given the choice of either remaining the way they are, becoming independent, or becoming the 51st state.  Although the margin is narrowing with every election they have always chosen to remain a commonwealth (My second wife was of Puerto Rican decent with family still living on the island.  A heated debate over this issue always ensued as most of her family did not want to see Puerto Rico gain independence or statehood because it would affect their property holdings on the island.  This, I later discovered, was the position most Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. but owning property on the island held).  In Galeano's defense one can argue that this was not the case in 1970 when he had written the book, but as the work had been updated in 1977, and a 25th Anniversary Edition was published in 1997, this fact could have easily been added.      Another case-in-point is the author's examination of Cuba, and the effects that the sugar industry has had on that nation.  While one is not arguing with his take that the "fate of the `sugar islands' to be incorporated one by one into the world market...condemned [them to produce] sugar until our day," (Page 65) has had an adverse affect on the economies of these nations, his ideological look towards the Castro revolution seems a little off base.  "Cuba," Galeano writes, "continues to depend on the sale of sugar, although the agrarian reforms of 1959 sparked an intensive diversification of the economy." (Page 65)  For Galeano, the throwing off of American interests has allowed the Cuban economy to expand, thus ending seasonal unemployment and allowing Cubans to work beyond the "five or so months of the sugar harvest, but for twelve months in the continuous job of building a new society." (Page 65)  What Galeano fails to have foreseen, is that in the 30 odds years since he penned this work, Cuba, which has had no influence from the United States, and trades freely with most of the outside world (a source of Cuban cigars from Canada flows steadily into the United States), is still one of the poorest nations in Latin America.  Castro's great social revolution, even with billions of Soviet dollars poured into the country, has failed to raise the living standard of the average person, and Cuba remains one of the poorest nations in the region.      It is clear that Galeano failed to look at both sides of the issue, and fell into the trap many who study history fall into: judging historical events by late 20th century standards.  The Spanish did not leave their shores with the expressed intent of destroying Latin American culture, nor did the concept of accepting native religions even occur to them.  The view of the world of 1500 was a very narrow one, where the Church ruled and if you did not follow their example then you were a pagan, ripe for conversion. To the Spanish, and later British and Americans, Latin America was a resource to exploit while bringing "civilization" to this region of the world.  Yes, it is true that imposing European ideals and customs on the natives destroyed their culture, just as it is true that imposing the Requerimiento, the telling of native peoples that if they did not accept Christ as their savior, then the Church would sanction the enslavement and exploitation of their cultures, was calculated and brutal. These acts however, were not a distinctly European invention, although reading Galeano would make one think it was.  While raking-over-the-coals European and American involvement in the region, the author fails to mention the same conditions embarked upon by non-whites, like West African nation's participation in the slave trade, the Japanese slaughter of Chinese nationals, and in our own part of the world, (as I have already pointed out), the Aztec civilization being an oppressive culture, whose empire was built on the labor of conquered peoples also.

 My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very "history lesson-ish") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, "So what?". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author. 
 I was really excited to read this book when I bought it, but was pretty disappointed by the end.  First, it is not science fiction.  Second, although the characters are well drawn, the story is just not that interesting.  Finally, and the most important drawback, the ending really sucks.  There is no resolution, so you feel like why did I go to the trouble to read this if it doesn't go anywhere.  Overall, I finished the last page feeling very unsatisfied 
 I bought the book on a recommendation a year back and tried to read it but failed to concentrate enough as it was a pretty dense book. Recently I picked it up again, this time determined to finish it as it is considered an important work.  I have forced myself and it takes forever to get through a single page. Either the author or the translator did a lousy job. I wonder if the original is easier to decipher. I ended up putting the book down on page 111 (a third into the book). Do not waste your time with this book. Foucault may have been a great philosopher who had an impact on many other scholars but I wouldn't know because i cant understand what he wrote.   HAHAHAHAH LET ME DEMONSTRATE WHAT I MEAN AS I QUOTE FROM THE BOOK (p.23), SEE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING ON YOUR FIRST TRY:  "Instead of treating the history of penal law and the history of the human sciences as two separate series whose overlapping appears to have had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, a disturbing or useful effect, according to one's point of view, see whether there is not some common matrix or whether they do not both derive from a single process of 'epistemologico-juridical' formation; in short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the humanization of the penal system and the knowledge of man."  NOT AS BAD AS FINNEGAN's WAKE, but it sure comes close 
 What a "piece of work" this was.  Boring, slow, full of highly irrelevant side plots... just a bomb NOT "the bomb" ;).  It took me forever to finish it because I would literally start falling asleep after a few pages and this is something that I very rarely experience.  There are like 5 or 6 parallel stories in this book which none come to any level of satisfactory fruition at the end of the book.  Save your money and more importanly your TIME... skip to something else if you come across this one 
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 although its a great idea, the CDROM is absolutely useless as a photo reference. this goes for figure drawing and other uses of the figure. the closeups are grainy at best and the navigation nothing more that a novelty  without high resolution.  the tutorial has some merit for just beginning,  but not really useful beyond a very short introduction. i am embarassed to  admit that i was lured into buying this book 
 I have read all of the books Ms. Fluke has written or at least all the Swenson ones.  I find this by far the worst book she has written so far- I think she is taking the whole recipes in the book a little far- every other page was a recipe there was no real story really and am I the only one that is tired of her pretty sister going on and on about how her looks are going to fade type thing BORING- and Hannah needs to decide already who she is going to marry lets get real both of them (Norman and Mike) would have already left her by now- either pick or dump them both.  To say this series is getting stale is an understatement.  Maybe Hannah needs a vacation somewhere where Mike and Norman aren't or her sister Andrea - I was excited to buy this book but could barely finish it - 
 Awesome concept, however I live in an apartment that doesn't have any south facing windows, so I was unable to get a signal.  I strongly advise against calling the XM radio help # from a phone that won't use up your cell phone minutes.  Had to call them four different times, and all they did was read me the instruction manual, and tell me that if I don't have signal my radio won't work (I had clearly established that fact already).  I recieved the radio for free because of a rebate, and didn't even intend on getting XM radio, but figured since the unit was free, and an MP3 player, to give it a try.   I was going to break down and buy the $70 car kit but then I ran across the AGT sportscaster for $20, which came with a car kit.  Since I can't use it in my house, I hook up the home base to the car kit, and at least I can use it that way.  This ended up being a lot of work for something I wasn't sure I wanted in the first place.  Haven't used the MP3 player yet, but napster does not seem the most user friendly.  (I have the majority of my songs on Itunes

 The only reason I bought this movie is because Alison Hannigan and Alexis Denisof was in it.(I'm a huge Buffy fan)  I knew it wasn't going to be the greatest films ever made but I didn't realize how bad it was going to be.  Watching the film I felt almost embarassed for the actors since they were given such crappy material.  The story line was thin and it seemed like the movie couldn't decide from whose point of view it wanted to tell the story from.  It begins and ends with a narration of the ex-boyfriend of Jennifer Episito's character but for most of the film he isn't an important character.  The direction was horrible.  It seemed they tried to make shots that were supposed to look cool but it only looked like they were covering up there low budget of a film.  There were some scenes that made me feel like I was watching an episode of Dawson Creek or Smallville because there were quite a few scenes with songs playing while showing how sad or troubled a character was.  I really wish they had cut that out because it had no point and made the movie drag out even longer than it should have.    The only good thing about the movie was the acting especially from the three female leads.  I actually thought Hannigan and Kinski had chemistry together. I would only recomend this movie to die hard Buffy fans or if you're a die hard fan of another actor in this film and then you should only rent it.  
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 The heel smoother does just an okay job.  I was disappointed 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 I am a big baseball fan, so I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This movie was very slow and it completely lost my attention. The combination of a strong cast and great original material (taken from the play) should have equaled a fun movie, I normally like movies like this, where the action takes place in one setting, this being a minor league ballpark.  Unfortunately I paid the price of my enthusiasm, this movie plodded along at a snail like pace, wasn't funny, and the plot was too unbelievable. The protagonists in the movie fight, bicker with their wives, and even fall in love, all within 2 hours of a baseball game. I recommend the play instead.  
 Having grown up in Coney Island I found this effort to be extremely substandard. This book takes the most uninteresting pictures of the most uninteresting individuals that I can imagine. Mr. Stein would have done much better to find alot more of the old timers who truly represent the feel and atmosphere of What Coney Island was, not so much the depressing delapidated dangerous neighborhood that it most unfortunately has become. He did not look hard enough to find what is truly representative of the Coney of lore, because had he done so, it's still there, just difficult to unearth. The pictures of the parade just shows how far down Americas greatest playground has gone. Do yourselves a favor and go to the library and pick out any number of other books on Coney Island and then compare. Unfortunately, you might become meloncoly and saddened, for Coney is really just a microcosm of what has become of this nations great cities 
 Origionally, I was given this book in 1979;  it is profound and awe inspiring in the faith provoking poetry that George Macdonald wrote - one 7 line poem/meditation for each day of the year.  I boughtt this new book as a gift. However this edition is horrible in that it appears to have been pasted together, daily poems may be numbered at the bottom of one page and begin on the next. Or the day's poem may be split between one page and the next. Several were mostly gibberish.  Also there is no introduction,  library of congress number or date of publication (or origional publication)to this edition.    It is a mess  
 The 2nd time I used this item the springs popped out and it was thrown away.  Since then I have purchased 2 different ones and the same has happened. 
 The theme of this book is not new. The plot goes out of the main story explaining surgeries that nobody'll do unless a M.D. and that gets boring. The way Kathleen saves herself is a fairytale and the way Dr. Morris and Dr. Downs save their selves is pathetic 
 this is not avant-garde or experimental or anything of value. believe him when he calls it hardcore. this kind of [...] only happens in america. richard kern takes advantage of the fact that americans, in their schizo frenzy, will mistake this for some kind of offensive euro trash art, meanwhile exploiting your daughters at just the right moment. it is all the more offensive that he considers himself an artist. this is not what experimental film or any other kind of film is all about. the only reason to watch these films is to get off. richard kern is what's wrong with new york. if you like larry clark, well i don't want to encourage you because you are sick and evil and altogether tasteless, but you will like this 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 Slow,dull and done on the "cheap"....stick with "Zulu" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining 
 I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you 
 Mr Davidar thought he was writing the great Indian novel. Unfortunately, what came out at the end was a schoolboy effort, characterized by Raj cliches, prose that sounds like it is translated, and occasional paragraphs containing personal views on India and Indians which dont mesh with the main text at all. I am glad I borrowed this free of cost from the library and did not waste my money - though I did waste my time reading it. All I can say is that it would make good reading on a long flight - at least the story has tempo and keeps you mildly entertained 
 After their on-screen duels with The Brian Jonestown Massacre's Anton Newcombe in clever documentary Dig!, the crazy Dandy Warhols are back with album number five.  Although nutjob Newcombe's taunted the Warhols that they'd sold out by working with a major record label, this album is the musical equivalent of the Portland, Oregon quartet flicking the bird at Capitol. No obvious singles, rougher production than the band's self-released Black Album and little chance of winning the love of the advertising agencies who previously doted over Bohemian Like You, it's the most defiant record label blow-off since Neil Young was sued by Geffen in 1984 for releasing albums that "didn't sound like Neil Young".  You can just imagine Dandy Warhols leader Courtney Taylor-Taylor nonchalantly tossing this scratchy demo at a table of record execs, daring them to release the disc so that both band and label can go down in flames together. In this game of musical Russian Roulette there are no winners though, for even when past hijinks such as the Come On Feel The Dandy Warhols' collection of dodgy covers such as The Jean Genie and The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald held a measure of ramshackle interest, this album proves terribly tedious. Rougher than a night in the New Orleans Superdome, this album will push the patience of most Dandy fans, with only All The Money Or The Simple Life Honey, Holding Me Up and Down Like Disco partially resembling the catchy earlier tunes from the cheeky imps. Even so, these tracks have nothing close to a sing-along chorus and, like many of the gathered songs, drag on long after the original ideas expire.  While it shares similarities via the traces of Charles Mingus jazz on Odditorium's Love Is The New Feel Awful, Radiohead's notoriously `difficult' Kid A album sounds catchier than Crazy Frog when compared to the Dandy Warhols' latest. Not only will it be hard to translate to a live stage, it often seems like it is an unfinished bootleg of jam sessions and indecipherable lyrics. It can only be hoped that this cobbled-together collection of droner rock really is the Dandys having a lend and a polished recording will be released in time for a huge Christmas marketing push. If they wanted to give a two finger salute towards their label The Dandy Warhols have been incredibly successful, yet the unfortunate by-product is the abject alienation of their fans. 
 I must confess that this has been one of the borest books I have ever read. Padded out with plenty of trivial ideas and lacking with something new. On the good side, its an overview over most of the topics in competitor analysis but really heavy going to go through 
 If you think you are buying a book with over 300 pages of recipes, save your money.  Over 2/3 of the book is repeat advice about how to eat the "real age way".  Along with this repeated information from Dr. Roizen's previous Real Age books is "silly" advice ranging from what kitchen utensils will increase your kitchen IQ along with how and when to buy produce. 
 Egan is a good writer, but in this book she does not transport us.  It feels as though she is distracted.  The research leaves a little something to be desired.  Lastly, the book seems to have a need for a brand of drama that fuels the imaginations of 18 year olds. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 THIS REALLY WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT.  IF YOU HAVE TO READ THIS TO FIND OUT WETHER OR NOT TO BUY IT...THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO BLOW THE MONEY.   BELIEVE ME, I DID!! 
 this book was written by a lawyer, and what can you expect, the basic message is: hire a lawyer (like the author of this book). The other advice is to go to a website, where you can buy template contracts etc, the books doens't give you a single one for free. It's just an advertisment of this website. All creative aspects of runing independent record label are reduced to minimum, also don't expect to get many practical advices, other than pay more money to other professionals, who will do everything for you. The author says, thay you don't need big money to run a record label, but doesn't give you a single hint how to actuall do it without big money, he is just repeating over and over that spending money on professional services is the thing to do. Well, right, I know that without this book, the problem is - I can't afford it! This book doesn't help you to solve this problem (and I'm sure you don't start with $50 000 for the first release, right?). Overal, this book doesn't give you practival advices, just general advices, which are nice, if you can afford them. And by the way, go to the website recommended by the author (I won't advertise it here, the book is the advertisment in fact) and buy all contracts from them! I love lawyers 
 That the stupifyingly sophmoric songwriting of Buffalo Tom's Bill whatshisname still finds an outlet onto an unsuspecting music buying public is beyond this humble listener's understanding. That said, this is an incredibly bad record 
 How can this be a great "modern" playwright when the views and themes of this major play have a better part for the 17th century than the 20th? I thought about it and if it was produced in  San Francisco even with it's respect for the arts, on merits the play would be jeered. Woody Allen thought that Strindberg hated women, but I think he just lacked any understanding of them 
 The book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on The Riders was interesting.  However, the author included a lot of details that just really didn't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts.  The photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book. My professor was able to bring Dr. Schrag to talk to our class.  He was a good lecturer-keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the Metro.  If he could make his writing style more like his teaching style, I think he would have much more success as an author 
 I bought the 688 for its price and Logitech name. Customer service was good. I bought it in April 2006 so I have 9 months of marginal satisfactory experience with the device. Took me 4 hours to program, and I needed their help. Same problem with CD as others have reported. Remote does not hold programming, and it is too much trouble to reprogram. Worked well for a while now works spasmodically. Some times I have to resort to the cable remote or the remotes for devices to get desired operation. Battery life is poor. I have had very good results with Logitech support. They would send me a updated file for me to install.  However, I wish I had spent more and gotten one with rechargable batteries and easier to read and operate controls 
 poorly written and offensive, particularly to south indians, daswani's novel reads like hurridly thrown together indian stereotypes capitalizing on the popularity of indian culture after monsoon wedding and bend it like beckham 
   This Cd suck a** and d*** all at the same time, what a waste of trash coming from a good atrist, but bother picking this s*** at the stores. get any other album from Twista except this one. I guess no one had balls to rate this 0.0 just to cover and rap this up 
 Sorry, this isn't a very good book at all. It is just a few lines and paragraphs strung together. Some of the information is OK but some just reflects an attitude and not real style. Better to get Clothes and the Man or Dressing the Man. Those are great books about dressing and style 
 I got this from Dell with my laptop. For some reason Dell doesn't make their docking station anymore, so they just gave me this without telling me the brand and the model number.  I installed it with no problem, but then the video through its USB is so extremly slow. You will see about half second delay more your mouse pointer. Then while I tried connecting a serial port on the docking station, it couldn't transfer the data.  I tried installing a USB to parrelle port printer cable on the computer, some how the Targus drivers made my usb printing disable. It doesn't display any error messages at all. I had to test the cable on another Dell laptop to find out it was the docking station's proble 
 There are three main reasons to why I did not enjoy this trilogy.  First, the story and overall flavor is a bit juvenile.  The first story in the trilogy is decent, but the latter two were simple and uninteresting.  Second, the main character of these stories is incredibly annoying.  A know-it-all, the book repeatedly showed how great the main character was in stark contrast to the rest of the characters who are portrayed as stupid, and well below the greatness of the main character.  Third, several things bothered me with the writing style of the books.  The author used a lot of words and phrases over and over again.  "Jason shuddered" must have been used at least two dozen times, trying to show how much smarter Jason was than the other characters.  Also, the second book tries to get philosophical and really does a poor job.  The author attempts to promote moral relativism, but does so in an overly obvious dialogue between two characters.  I appreciate philosophy in narrative, but it must be done well like CS Lewis and Arthur Clarke.  All this to say that the book is a disappointment, there are much better science fiction books out there to read 
 Unless you are a far-left political idealist; "open-minded," as Mr. and Mrs. Stone say, their book offers little useful information for retirees 
 This book will never make you feel the sensation of impending doom that you testify while watching the recent German movie based in this book. The book is very short, it's has no intention of going deep into every character's psyche. It's not a bad book at all, but it's uninteresting 
 I found the humor to be somewhat arid.  I had trouble staying awake. Not recommended while driving 
 The other day I have picked up the latest book by our first Turkish Nobel Laureate in literature, Orhan Pamuk. As far as one could tell, the decision to honor him with the Nobel Prize was largely based on this particular literary accomplishment. At least, when asked by reporters why Pamuk deserved the Prize, Professor Horace Engdahl, the very multilingual Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, kept referring to this book.  The book in question, Istanbul: Memoirs and the City, is a concoction of encyclopedic information, nostalgia-invoking monochrome photographs and the author's unsettling childhood memories. It could very well be crowned his worst work to date by readers familiar with the author's previous books. As I forced myself through page after page of what seems to be Pamuk's much distorted perception of his hometown, I can honestly say that his childhood memories sprinkled here and there were what kept me awake.  Just like in his previous works, a constant undertone of pessimism and hopelessness is palpable throughout the book, but his negativism is more disconcerting this time around as he unsuccessfully tries to ascribe his internal conflicts and his personal darkness to a magnificent town whose wonders never cease to amaze.   Owing to his affluent background and is uber-privileged vantage point, Pamuk's views are so dreadfully skewed that you might start believing him while he wholeheartedly describes the citizens of his version of Istanbul, hovering in a dream-like state of communal melancholy.  His imaginary Istanbul - with its decrepit buildings, filthy streets and rabid dogs roaming its dark, narrow, and decaying alleys - is not the vibrant city throbbing with liveliness that the ordinary folks, like his readers or the lower class Istanbullus for that matter, are able to perceive. His repeated use of the adjective dilapidated to describe certain aspects of Istanbul feels deliberate and malevolent.  As he paints this almost repulsive picture of Istanbul, he does not fail to rebut disagreeing views of European Istanbul lovers by telling them, "You need to live here at least ten years to be able to see it through my eyes."   Who are you to know what you are seeing?  Pamuk sees Istanbul as a fallen fantasy town where he is entitled to scorn poverty and the impoverished which uglifies what is rightfully his. He is visibly and unashamedly tormented as this city, for which he fosters a pathological affection, ignores his irrational expectations of conformity altogether. She continues to pulsate, breathe and change, remains jovial and full of energy, determined to enjoy whatever life throws at her as Pamuk watches from the sidelines in anguish.  Most disturbing of it all is his suggestion, maybe not directly but most certainly inferentially, that Istanbullus have no fight left in them. They have already lost the game and have made peace with the fact - hence comes the hï¿½zï¿½n a term he is trying a little too hard to coin - and are desperately waiting for the shoe to drop. (Hey, why not generalize this to the entire country while we are at it and reinforce the whole Sick-Man-of-Europe deal?) Pamuk's yearning for all things European and his dislike for whatever may represent the east is even more pronounced in parts of the book where he professes his love to Istanbul.  It is fair to say that Pamuk's work brought him very little acclaim in Turkish literature, and few if no awards. His writing skills have always been an issue of debate among his colleagues. Nowadays, there is a lot of discussion in Turkey about how his literary inelegance is magically lost in translation, how his sentences are invigorated and become more passable with some creative interpretation from his talented translator Melling Freely, as well as many proven accusations of plagiarism.  Until recently, Pamuk has been known to steer clear of politics. He has spent most of his career carefully avoiding political subjects, or approaching them only tangentially, with the calculated caution and slickness expected from bourgeoisie intelligentsia.   His abrupt and seemingly unnatural politicization began with Snow, his most politically-charged novel to date. His loving embrace of "all things political", unforeseeable as it was, tightened up faster than expected, reaching its peak with his astounding public statements regarding the killing of one-and-a-half million Armenians and thirty-thousand Kurds. This incarnation of Pamuk even claimed that he was the only person in Turkey who had enough cojones to broach these sensitive issues. Why the sudden change, you might ask yourself. I did ask myself, for one thing, why did the vanilla boy become interested in politics in his fifties?   All the publicity and buzz surrounding this "new and improved" Pamuk must have sounded like music to Pamuk's mostly English speaking allies and co-workers, who have done more than their share of P.R. for Pamuk's continued existence in European and American literary circles. These selfless allies have gone so far out of their way to promote this one specific author in such unprecedented fashion that it makes one wonder why.  Measly commissions they were to get from the marketing of Pamuk's books were so out of proportion with the amount of effort they put into hyping Pamuk to literary stratosphere that you have to ask why?  Did the promoters of Pamuk have an ulterior motive? Was the French Parliament's passing of the bill that criminalizes "questioning of armenian genocide" just when Pamuk's received his award a coincidence? Is European Union, which harbors this primordial mentality that does not stop at telling you what you can or cannot say but goes a step further and dictates what you can and cannot question, worth joining? Did people around Pamuk lure him into doing things that he might not have done otherwise by using the brilliant Nobel Prize as bait?  Was it worth it?  Reportedly, Pamuk's editor at Random House, George Andreou said in an interview in 2001, that if Pamuk were to write more politically he would have won a Nobel Prize by then.   This statement answered at least some of my questions 
 The play "Into the Woods" not only contains sinister elements, but has an overall dark message to convey.  It preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine.  It teaches is that lying, stealing, cheating, and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one's perspective on life.  Also, that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you.  This religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs 
 My youngest brother, who has a pretty strange sense of humor, bought me this CD for my birthday; I wonder how he knew I didn't own it already? I don't even know where to begin with this one. What can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop? And the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable. Does she expect anyone to take her seriously? After her first album, I thought Carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning, particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches. Instead of getting better, though, she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. Rappers like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott and Usher are brought in to add spice, but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing. She may have a lot of #1 hits, but who can tell any of them apart? Rainbow is only Carey's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere.	 	D-  Tom Rya 
 This newborn care DVD is strictly for caring for a newborn infant, in other words, what you learn here won't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks.  My biggest beef with this DVD is that it totally just skims over all the basics, such as how to breastfeed properly, how to bottlefeed properly, how to swaddle properly, how to calm a baby properly, etc.  All the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn, each is given about 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead, the bulk of the program is wasted on things like "pre-birth preparation," which interestingly appears toward the end of the program, and how the mother should take care of herself.  These are important things to know, but not for a "ultimate baby care DVD."  The DVD packaging is also very misleading.  It says "over an hour of hints"... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of "you should always consult your doctor" warning, plus a long end-of-program credit.  The actual content is about 55 minutes.  I've seen this DVD and the "ABC of Newborn Baby Care" DVD and even though the latter is not great, it's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step, and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly.  Between the two DVDs, I definitely recommend the latter.  BTW, you can likely find this at your local library.  It's also available from Netflix.  It's just not worth the price of the DVD, not even 1/10 of the price 
 Having read other Catherine Coulter novels, I expected this to be along her usual level of excellence.  I was wrong.  In the introduction she states this isn't a rewrite of the novel, just putting it in different clothes -- she should have done some rewriting!  The characterization leaves much to be desired, the hero or heroine don't inspire any empathy, the writing at times feels emotionless (her complete lack of emotional punctuation, such as exclamation points, is an excellent example) and the dialogue is clipped and underdeveloped.  While the idea behind the story is good, the actual story itself is not up to Coulter's standards 
 This book should be a freebie considering all the promotional content. I read about half the book before I threw it aside. There are few ideas, and a lot of promotional stuff about the cheesey marketing people that contributed articls 
 I had high hopes for this, expecting a bigger dose of Maureen's refreshing liberal arguments and interesting points.  No such luck.  It's hard to start the analysis considering how she jumps from point to point throughout the book and throughout each chapter.  You'd think the title might give it focus, but that very question doesn't even come up until the mid-point of the book (about where I am now; not sure I have the will to finish), and her wittest method of answering it is some cutesy tangent about genetics and how sperm is no longer necessary to fertilize eggs.  harharhar.  Up until that point, it's mostly a collection of random rants and anecdotes about how men supposedly can't handle women who are smarter than them or make more money, etc.  Also, that all these societal standards are the fault of men, completely omitting women's responsibility in upholding them.  (Get a clue: women are at least as insistent on the man being richer or more powerful no matter her standing, just like women expect the man to be taller no matter her height.)  If Maureen truly believes men desire ditzes, maybe she can find comfort in knowing the release of this book just increased her compatibility 
 Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.  The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?  I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read 
 Tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds.  I am invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index as well as other index funds, but this is a bit too much.  If you understand the concept of indexing, save some cash and skip this book 
 This is a good book for serious health nuts that have the time and energy to make simple easy recipes with a million strange ingredients that you've probably never heard of. If you plan on making lots of baby food with kelp and sea weed then this is the book for you 
 This is one of maybe five reviews I've ever written online. I only do so if I absolutely love a product or am absolutely appalled by something I wish a fellow amazon addict had included in an online review. This will be the latter. This book is rife with translation errors. Not even so much translation errors because I don't speak German but basic grammatical mistakes; "From another perspective we see the force of this un-Dionysian spirit in action directing its effects against myth, when we turn our gaze toward the way in which the way in which the presentation..." -page 56 (this is just one in a long list of examples). Another weird fact about this book is that it is the size of a magazine? I have no fundamental problem with that, I loved JG Ballard's The Atrocity Exhibition which had the same dimensions; however because this book is a mere 80 pages it's just awkward to read. Do yourself a favor and buy another version of this book that doesn't have an abundance of errors. The only saving grace for this POS are the ideas contained therein. 
 This book is not realistic. Most of the first's are things like when you first change your atm pin to your wedding date and things of that nature. Not what I thought a first book should contain. How about the first time someone calls you Mr. & Mrs. So and So or something that will probably actually happen 
 I purchased this magazine solely to get cheaper access to ESPN Insider Online.  The magazine is so all over the place otherwise that its hardly worth reading.  Its chock full of tidbits that barely gloss over sports topics.  I keep it in my bathroom and I guess its good there when I only have a few minutes to read while brushing my teeth or whatnot.  Don't expect SI-type depth though, its full of ads and slick factoid type departments.  Reading this magazine is like watching Sportscenter, a lot of many little things with no depth on anything.  I guess its worth it for less than 60 cents an issue, but if I sat down to read this magazine cover to cover I would be done with it totally in under 15 minutes....enjoy 
 I purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model Fujifilm camera, reviews here, price and functions. At the same time, I also purchased the larger xD card. Almost out of the box, this camera has given me nothing but grief. What others had said about the blurry photos I can certainly echo. A month or so after purchase, the lens would not open, or it would not open totally. I first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries, the problems still existed - SOME OF THE TIME. Not always - just sporadically. Just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities.   In addition to that, now that I'm looking at other brands of cameras I find the xD card I purchased is not transferable so I'm out the cost of that as well. Another malfunction of this camera is after "erasing" all photos on the xD card, taking more photos and uploading the new photos, I found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones? I don't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera.   I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone....it's a total dud. I'm very disappointed with Fujifilm and am now looking at Nikon and Cannons. Good luck Fujifulm...you need it 
 I wouldn't recommend this book at all for one your better off going to see the movie because the book tells a whole bunch of different stories which leads you in different storis instead of just talking about the same thing the whole movie. I would just recommed seeing the movie over the book 
 I try to read items that I would not necessarily agree with. However, this piece of doggerel is nothing but exagerrations, misquotes, and spin. She uses tacky research to make points that don't exist, then brushes off any critique as "liberal bias". If you are a conservative, please read something that will allow us to discuss matters. Coulters' book should be titled "Slander: Liberal Lies I Made Up. 
 Was rather of a long story and sometimes hard to read as it doesn't get to the point quick. But I did get one good idea from it so there was some value in it for me 
 I am so glad I read this book because it helps me feel OK about our family bed. HOWEVER I was hoping for some ways to get our baby to sleep better but solutions are sorely lacking. For those I found another Sear's recommendation: The No-Cry Sleep Solution, which supports cosleeping but also offers ways for everyone to get better sleep. If you want your family bed validated this is a great book 
 This book is full of editorial errors and the Boston Globe should be embarrassed that they ever printed it.  We waited 86 years for a championship. The Boston Globe could have spent a few more days to get the book out without these glaring mistakes.  Here are a few that I found in less than 10 minutes.  1. Box score for game 1 of World Series is incorrect.  RBI category is wrong.  2. Line score at top of page shows St. Louis scoring 4 runs in top of 9th inning.  (Good thing that did not really happen)  3. Page 22:  Text on left of page that describes picture is incomplete sentence.  4. Box score for game 2 of World Series is wrong.  They actually printed the box score for game 3.  Box score from game 2 is missing.  (Game 3 box score is listed twice in the book)  It's like Curt Schilling never pitched!  5. Box score for game 4 shows Arroyo giving up an earned run.  Hard to give up an earned run in a game that was 3-0.  6. Box score for game 5 of ALCS shows New York against Anaheim.  How bad is that?  Can't even get the teams right.  Pretty sure the Red Sox played in that game.  (I went to it!)  I contacted the Boston Globe and the editor (James Reid Laymance) directly to inform them of the errors.   It has been nearly a month now and I have not been contacted.  Do not buy this book!!  As a historical keepsake these errors greatly diminish its value. 
 All of the other negative reviews are correct. For a made-for-TV movie, from Hallmark, this is the worst thing I have ever seen posing as a Bible story!   I don't mind that they tried to incorporate the story of Sodom & Gomorrha to show the wickedness of mankind, and that they made Lot into Noah's best friend. They went too far, though, when they had Lot become a pirate who survived the flood and tries to take over the ark with his own pirate crew. Seriously, that's in this movie!  The most offensive thing towards the Bible is when Noah and his wife are reflecting upon God's destruction of Sodom & Gomorrah. Noah says they need to find a scribe to write down the story, to which his dizzy wife says, "Oh, you can't trust them. Scribbling scribes have the worst reputation--they change things! By the time they get through with it, they'll probably say we weren't even there!"   I can't believe that a Bible movie would discredit the reliability of scripture itself! This is awful!  The special effects are hokey, there are LOOOONG boring stretches, and they seem to think the whole Noah story is a big joke to have fun with. This is like an episode of XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS, in it's seriousness and sense of humor. I'm surprised that Hallmark didn't get a boycott over this movie when it first came out. Maybe they did? They deserved one over this stinker 
 There are some good principles in the book, but its way to easy to get lost in all of the repetition and blandness. The section on fibonocci retracements was useful and seems to work well for me in practice; however, I didn't get much else from the book 
 Cohen should read a dictionary before writing about ethics.  Self-promoting, and as is with most New York Times journalists, knowledge of subject matter and/or credentials for pontificating are sorely lacking 
 There are much better products by LUSH.  I got a free sample of this conditioner and used it along with LUSH's Trichomania solid shampoo.  At first I really liked it, but throughout the day, my hair felt like it was getting oilier.  I'm not sure if it was the Trichomania or the Coolaulin, but I gave both away to my friend who likes coconut.  The smell wasn't my favorite either (I'm not a coconut person), but if you like coconut, you will love the shampoo and the conditioner.  As for me, I will stick to American Cream and Rehab.  **UPDATE** December 21, 2005 I tried the Coolaulin conditioner again, and my hair didn't get oily at all.  I'm not sure what happened the first time I tried it, but it was fine this time around.  I'm not a coconut person, so this conditioner is still not my fave (American Cream!!), but I do want to add on TWO stars and make the rating *~*FOUR STARS*~* because the conditioner made my hair really soft 
 Just bought Mapsend from Amazon. They sent me version 2 when this is clearly out of date. Don't be fooled - it's a piece of crap. This is devious and dishonest of Amazon - no wonder it was marked down. Avoid Magellan at all costs.....avoid Mapsend at all costs.....maybe even avoid Amazon if this is typical of the stunts they pull. 
 Like many autobiographies,  this book is best before Handy becomes WC Handy the great and venerated music composer and publisher.  Handy describes coming up in the hard world of the South in the years that Reconstruction was being demolished and Jim Crow segregation was being imposed.     Handy's childhood decision to become a musician flew in the face of his family's and much of the Black church (Handy's father was a minister) world's view that being a musician of any kind was hardly better than becoming a criminal.   Classically trained in both the violin and the trumpet and in composition and harmony, Handy always looked to the folk music of working class and farming African Americans and to rhythms and music he knew came from Africa as his source of inspiration. In fact, when Handy became a music professor at a Black state-run college in Alabama, he ended up resigning when the administration frowned on his teaching the students to venerate the music their people created.        Handy gives some interesting stories of life in the Black ministrel companies he worked in.  These companies were a focal point of Black entertainment between the civil war and the second world war.  Not only did 19th Century figures like Banjoist Horace Weston, and the early 20th Century dance and comedy men like Bert Williams and Bill Robinson graduate from minstrelsy to Broadway, but 20th century stars like Louis Jordan, Dizzy Gillespie, and Rufus Thomas got their start in minstrel shows.  These shows trained musicians and singers who became the founding stars of blues and Jazz. One such minstrel troupe had Classic Blues Divas Ma Rainey, Clara Smith, and Bessie Smith, all on the same bill.        Handy discusses the danger and persecution Black minstrel companies faced in the Jim-Crow South. The railroad coach his company traveled  in contained secret compartments to hide the Black entertainers from police and lynch mobs as well as places to store firearms for self-defense. Handy tells several stories that make clear that W.C. Handy might never have survived to write the Memphis and St. Louis Blues without the secret compartment or self defense with firearms.         Contrary to popular misconceptions, the blues is not an ancient form of Black musical expression. It arose in the 1890s and early 20th century. Handy grew up in Alabama, lived in Kentucky,  and Mississippi and was headquartered for years in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the big town in the area that produced Charlie Patton, Robert Johnson, Son House, Muddy Waters, and Johnny Lee Hooker, He had heard old time Black banjo and fiddle tunes since childhood.  Yet, he did not hear the blues until the early 20th Century.   He points out that the real "inspiration" for him to incorporate the blues into the music he wrote for his dance band came in a small town in Mississippi where his band played a dance.  The country people demanded that a ragged blues trio of mandolin, guitar, and bass play a few song. As Handy and his band were tired, they welcomed the opportunity to take a break.  However with the three blusicians were finished, the crowd showered more money on them for a few songs than Handy's whole band received for a whole night's work.  Playing for Black dancers, Handy explained how he had to incorporate the blues and other rhythms and music that came from Africa into his music. Then, Handy is always insistence that the  base of his music is working and farming Black folk.  As he enters fame, Handy remains interesting, especially when he explains the way he had to battle swindling and racism when he became a music publisher. He's also pretty adamant about demanding respect for African American entertainers and for song writers and composers as well.  He's a good, friendly and often humorous writer throughout.   
 I found this book very unhelpful.  I agree with the reviewer Luiza about its shortcomings.  
 I love, love, love, Lipglass normally.  But this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go-go dancer. 
 Browsing the free pages shown on Amazon I thought I was going to get a book with lots of Photos of "shabby" style furniture and tips on how to get the look.Instead what I got was a book that reads like a 'day in the life of' story.I didnt want a biography.This book takes you along on the authors trips to assorted flea markets and whatnot and tells you what she bought and where she is going to use it.Not at all what I expected to get 
 How can you write a children's book on Great Moments in Baseball History and not include 1956 World Series Perfect Game! Don Larsen's World Series accomplishment was only recently matched by another former Yankee, David Wells!! What a terrific oversight 
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 In Country, how can I describe this book? In four words crappy piece of garbage; am so unfortunably forced to read this literature for school, and i've got too say, to give it two thumbs up you'll have to read it 8 times. I agree this book could be a very good book if they stood with the plot in part 1, but Tom,Sam, and Lonnies life story just isn't interesting. Look at their names, there too basic. Too tell you the truth Kentucky is boring, the books boring, and the author is boring.  You have to drink coffee to read this book; the real downside is that the coffee will end up costing more than the book. My advise to all you readers is to jack the book from Barnes and Noble,Borders or photo copy it, save the money for the coffee because your gonna need it 
 I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle 
 I've been playing the cello for almost 40 years and I agree about the complaints about the vibrato and phrasing:  overdone!   I also agree with the question about "aristocratic" playing:  why all of the exaggeration?  Instrument playing should ideally be like that of a vocalist, where one is not limited by one's technical abilities.  I doubt that Ms. Weilerstein would sing these phrasese the same way she plays them.  There is still time for her to develop, however.  If you want to hear more refined playing, listen to Gendron, Rose, Fournier or Rostropovich. 
 This is quite simply one of the sappiest, self-serving collections of poetry to be published in the past 5 years or so in America.  It is AWFUL 
 I bought this book as a present but when it arrived it definitely was not like what I expected.  There is only one project design with directions.  The rest of the book is just pictures of what other artists have done.  Maybe this would be a good book if you are a skilled carver but for a novice it may be difficult to replicate the designs without any directions 
 Dream signals in full circles is a great album, but this is terrible! it ruins one good song after another. Well, it gets two stars though, there are two-three pretty good songs on the album... but I prefer the original 
 This book is good as a primer if you want consider achieving a CCNA.  This book is not good as a study guide for the exam, due to its lack of granularity on most CCNA subjects 
 I gave this book 2 stars more out of nostalgia then anything. It is chalk full of florally pros that border on the boring. I am not sure what came first the movie or the book however I found both of them to be severely lacking. The characters are hard to like especially Claire and by the end of the book I didn't much care if they got together or not 
 This text is abysmal. It is riddled with errors and omissions, gives incomplete examples, and presents information unsequentially. It relies too much and for too long on the  horizontal model without practical applicatoin to journals and statements. If your college uses this text (as Medaille College and Finger Lakes Community College currently do) run away!  Fortunately, many of the gaps are filled in by the PowerPoint presentations they make available on their support site: http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072472960/student_view0/ Note that these presentations are more extensive than the ones on the Topic Tackler CD that comes with the book. You must download these presentations if you want to have a chance with this book 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 Virtually all the ideas in this book are already practiced by most successful company's - they just describe them differently. There is nothing new. My other problem is how the author uses the book to promote a personal agenda. And talk about ego - his family, friends, and other business initiatives are promoted in the book. And most of the pictures have nothing to do with the title of the book or how it is positioned. If it's going to be an autobiography, TELL US SO. I should have known something was up when most of the reviewers were either politicians, friends or other people that have never ran successful businesses.   And speaking of business success, a share of stock in Jan 1994 (around the time Mr. Bakke became CEO) was trading at an adjusted $5 per share. Seven years later in December of 2002 (the year Mr. Bakke retired), the share price was $3.02. No thanks - I'll put my money in GE. Need I say more.   Look, I'm sure this guy is a great person and he is obviously super smart but I do not think this is a credible book. 
 It starts out well but half-way through, it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis. Avoidable 
 This book is just plain hateful, mean and nasty. The humor is of South Park IQ level. If you laugh at talking poop, you will probably think this is funny.  I'm keeping the book because I enjoy the pictures (that is, the ones that are reasonably well reproduced). Were the 70's tacky? Yes. Were they fun? YES. Lighten up Lileks. It's ok to have fun. What is your decor? Victorian? Now that's laughable! 
 Being a novelist, I thought at the very least I might enjoy it from that perspective, but no. I was bored to tears. I watched this with my then partner, and we both looked at each other like, "What the heck is this about?" We made it about 3/4 of the way through when we finally turned it off and rented another movie on PPV instead. It was boring, tedious, and monotonous. I suppose it was trying to eclectic, but in my opinion, it failed miserably 
 I agree with what others have said about the re-designed Sport Knit Pants. I had been happily buying the tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when Lands End decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead, presumably because some customers had requested the newer look.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.  I returned the new pants and this formerly loyal Lands End customer is now shopping elsewhere 
 Having read all of Sedaris's books, I think it's fair to say that this is easily his weakest. I suppose it should be expected since it was written before the others, but if you read the reviews on the book you'd think it was world class literature. The only stories I enjoyed in it are "My Manuscript" and "Glen's Homophobia Newsletter Vol.3, No. 2." The essays "Diary of a Smoker" and "Santaland Diaries" are good as well. Ultimately his essays are still better than his stories which accounts for their making up all his other books. The stories are agonizingly over-the-top; that style work well on tv shows like Strangers with Candy but is painful in print. Do yourself a favor and skip this for one of his other MUCH better books (i.e. Me Talk Pretty One Day or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim) 
 With great anticipation, I purchased this CD but it came in some obscure "Super Audio CD" format by Sony. It is unplayable on my CD player and unreadable on my laptop. The Amazon product description does not designate this. Bummer. Now I have to go through some return/replace hassle 
 Like the author herself, this book is mean-spirited and puts doing away with the competition before gaining insights. It's spiritually impoverished, learning without wisdom. Mean-spirited 
 "Enemy of my Enemy" is the second book in the Spirit Walk series and the fourth book in the Voyager relunch sereis and it seem to get worse. Now Captian Chkotay and his sister are being held by a changling and a changling is in control. But, of course Janeway knows this and she has sent Tom Paris to save Voyager and her crew. I have to say at this point, I am reading any Voyager books from my local library, because I can't see spending money on this books. As I said in my last review, die-hard will love this books, but others may want to skip this book 
 This book should be assigned in creative writing classes.  Grammar errors, lifeless characters, stilted dialogue, misused adjectivies -- a case study on how NOT to write a novel 
 This CD was supposed to be soft, easy music that would help you go to sleep.  I did go to sleep almost immediately but not because of the music--I was just very tired.  However, the music actually woke me up a couple of times when it got just a little louder.  Maybe it's me, but I didn't find this product to do as promised.  
 I read this book for a class in Communication Theory and Criticism. The book was so cynical of what media is really about, it made me question at time why I should even become a journalist, if corporate America has such a  hold over all forms of media 
    I have read this book several times. Each time, I grew more and more puzzled. I thought...I thought this was supposed to be about writing!  It isn't. If you're looking for Brenda's personal philosophy, this is The Book. If you want advice on how to write, this is a terrible book. The only good side could be that she encourages writers who don't see themselves as good writers, or writers at all.   Other than that, the book is so many murdered trees. Brenda spouts the whole garbage about truth being truth if you think it is true. Her school is the type that shrinks from approaching the technical aspects of writing. Or telling some people that their piece of writing is junk.    Basically, she tells you what you want to hear. All is good and nice, a few mildly interesting stories, and no relevant advice on writing. I kept getting this nauseated feeling while reading it.   Snore.. 
 This is a very short book that summarizes the plot of Taxi Driver. The author adds a handful of ideas along the way, ranging from the obvious (Travis Bickle is a borderline personality) to the questionable (when buying guns, he's choosing from a wide range of penises). It helps that the author is a woman. Her take on the violence and sexuality of the story is slightly different from the other (male) reviews I have read. However, there's so little here that is new, it's not worth buying. This would be better as a chapter in a larger book 
 Sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews.I'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess.Nothing is moving,action is zero and filming is poor. we are very far away from dirty dozen,battle of the bulge,midway,enemy below etc.... a total waste of time and money 
 Having been famous all over eastern Europe for its beauty and splendor, the amber room's unsolved disappearance in 1945 caused a true flood of unbridled speculations. The mystery proved itself extremely fertile for all sorts of fantasy-stories, mystery-novels, faked history reviews and other nonsense.  What is known & proven: after having been conquered by Adolf Hitler's soldiers in 1941, the room was transported from its palace outside Leningrad (= nowadays' St.-Petersburg) to the German city of Konigsberg (= nowadays' Russian Kaliningrad). On its way some of its items were stolen by German soldiers. Having arrived at Konigsberg, the room was exhibited in the local castle. In the second half of worldwar 2, when the danger of Allied bombing steadily increased, the amber room was stored for safety in the castle's cellars.   From this point knowledge stops and speculation sets in. In August 1944 Konigsberg was bombed twice. Its castle, right in the city centre, was hit and burned out completely. In April 1945 Konigsberg was captured by the Soviet army in savage streetfighting. In other words, from the moment of its storage opportunities for destruction had been plenty. The more so, while amber burns very well from itself.  Destruction of works of art surely was quite common in those terrible days in eastern Europe. Many of them vanished without trace. The difference with the amber room is only made by the latter's huge reputation, promptly turning its unrecorded disappearance into a legend.  I think it makes more sense to turn to the reality of our days. Sponsored by 'Ruhrgas AG', a German firm dealing in Russian gas, the amber room has been rebuilt with great Russian craftsmanship. In May 2003 Russian president Putin and German chancellor Schroder officially re-opened it.   The truly magnificent replica has been enrichened by one of its authentic panels. Presenting us with an Italian landscape made from colored stone, this panel was one of the items stolen in 1941. After having decorated an ordinary German living room for many years, it was traced by the police and returned to the Russians.  Purchasing a book or DVD on the replica surely is worth your money. You'll find them on many a German site. It makes more sense than losing yourself in all sorts of idle speculation.    
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 This book was delivered many weeks after ordering.  Although the original order showed a shipping date between X and Y, I thought it was just a CYA in case of a shipping delay.  I did not know that Amazon did not have this item available for immediate shipment. Amazon's price seemed a balm for the delay however. 
 Caution: One trick in this book is physically dangerous to your cat. Our vet said it is dangerous for a cat to stand-up on their back legs. Their hind legs can not support this activity. You will injure your cat. Please stop this trick. There are many, many other tricks cats can learn & not hurt themselves over time. PS Dog's hind legs can support standing-up - just not cats legs. 
 Though I have only become acquainted with the Lovecraft universe/Cthulhu Mythos in the past year, and though I was greatly looking forward to delving into this collection when I discovered it, I really feel that this particular collection falls short.  Devotees to the mythos that enjoy any story with any mention of the Lovecraftian place-names, characters, or phenomena will no doubt enjoy this volume for trivia-compiling purposes, but I found the stories within to be mediocre at best and occasionally downright laughable.  These stories will most likely not be enjoyable to most readers.  The few bright spots (perhaps, less dim spots) include China Mieville's "Details", though even this seems to fall rather far from the mark set by his other work.  A large portion of the others are just silly or seem to depend entirely on the final single-line zinger for horrific affect.    I would strongly suggest that those new to Lovecraft, and in search of more of this type of literature, seek out volumes such as "Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos" or any of the fine works by Thomas Ligotti.  If you are determined to read this particular collection, please do not pay more than 3 dollars for it in a used bookstore 
 Sure it has many pretty lights and a slick design. One problem though: it is terrible at SHAVING! I was using my old Braun 6520, and was quite happy with it. Then I saw a good deal for this "new, redesigned, superb, self-cleaning" shaver and decided to upgrade. Bad idea! After shaving with it, it looks like I have a day-old stubble. No matter how much I twist and press it, the "new super system of blades designed by no one other than Gillette" does a bad job.  This morning I actually pulled my old 6520 out, shaved off as much as I could with this "360 Complete" garbage, and then used 6520 to see how much "clean up" it would do. The difference was both very visible and substantial! I am really sorry I bought this and feel duped by their marketing... Don't make the same mistake as me. Buy something else and save your money 
 I read Kozol to actually be amused. It saddens me to think that colleges force students to read books like these. Young minds take this at face value. I am a native New Yorker, from Brooklyn. My parents were working class, and we had no extras. What I hate most about Kozol is his obvious white guilt. He never talks about personal responsibility. It is just the city not taking care of the poor and needy. That is the problem with most liberals, they offer opinions, work on the emotions of people, and never offer solutions. When mayor Giuliani wanted welfare workers to work, IE pick up leaves in the park, there was a great outcry-well, when I was in college, I worked cleaning up after horses-just to pay for part of tuition, and I waited tables, ETC. Why should they not work if they are getting a check? He also talks about how the suburbs spent more money per child in the school system-yet he never mentions what those parents in the suburbs spent each year on taxes--There is a lot more I could write, but I would be here all day. Take it from a native New Yorker who worked as a teacher in the South Bronx-he plays on your feelings, but in the end, by portraying poor people as victims he gives people a way to "blame the system," and insults every hardworking person who has improved his or her life 
 After reading these reviews and taking Anna Lee's very sage advice to try it via the library first, now I understand.  It looks as if Mr. Gordon had several of his friends jump in and write reviews to get Ms. Lee's unfavorable review off the front page.  Being the suspicious type, I checked out these reviewers, and they have all written only one review each, all giving Mr. Gordon five stars for his book, all within days of each other.    But no matter.  Typical lawyer tactics don't impress me and neither did this typical lawyer's book.  Having spent most of my adult life in the music industry in NYC and elsewhere, I have experienced just about everything in this business, and I am only sorry that Ms. Lee and so many others had to listen in person to this gentleman's spiel, as that's what The Future of the Music Business turns out to be: a spiel.    Yes, he has the requisite case studies with "indie" artists giving it a go on their own as an attempt to add cred to his manuscript, but Mr. Gordon (or perhaps his ghostwriter) knows nothing about digital technologies, that is apparent, nor does he offer his readers any new solutions.  He is very much from the old school where the only game in town was the nearest major label that pulled all the purse strings.  Now that the Internet has obliterated that, formerly holier-than-thou industry types are finding themselves at a real loss as for how to deal with it, and we see plenty of old dogs with half-a$$ed new tricks to push on the public.   The only advice I have for those in this new music industry, and it's free:  Carve your own niche instead of trying to fit the ones sculpted by the suits.  In these strange times where Kelly Clarkson, et. al., are unbelievably considered punk rock, we are definitely due for some big changes.  The markets are changing with the emergence of India and China, not to mention a European Union with over 450 million people.  Add the Internet to this mix and you have the opportunity for many niche markets to evolve without the current major label system as a constituent.  The Internet is integrating into and changing the very nature of TV and radio as we know them, and amen to that.  Mr. Gordon deserves credit for one thing and one thing only: his book is no better or no worse than anything else out there.  
 It may be good for a university classroom, but I don't think this book works well on its own.  It lacks the details that would really make clear the significance of the people and events and leave them in the memory.  I was even bored by the section on the Cultural Revolution!  But I did learn a fair bit nonetheless 
 I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
 It was not the biggest, nonetheless, a mistake in buying this book.  I am sending it back not bacause of 8 bucks, but to make a point.  It is a very trivial and quite hostile writing ;seems like it is aimed to put down other women (or frogs, as a female co-author calls them).  In a view that co-author is "e-mail bride" herself, it is very strange to see such aggression towards her Russian female compatriots.  Besides, the insights into the Russian culture are quite shallow and trite.     In summery, this book was a waist of time and money.   
 I would have to say that i'm very much angered by the poor quality of this "textbook", if it can be called a textbook. A textbook, by definition, should try to explain everything in detail as much as possible and convey the concepts in a clear and well-illustrated manner. On the contrary, this book is full of partial details in long-winded sentences, which makes a already hard topic even more difficult to follow. As a textbook, it is counter-productive. Maybe the author dont want to bother, but the lack of detail and jumping of thought is striking in this book, not to mention the incomplete, half-baked C-like Java code that does not even compile. It is a shame that it is used as a textbook anywhere, it is even a bigger shame that some school selects it as textbook for the reason other than academic 
 This product is inproperly titled. One would think they had purchased Linklater's effective book full of in-depth explanation of Standard IPA. But it only includes a meager cassette and 3-paged booklet. Don't waste your time or money. It's not worth it 
 This is one party I'm glad I wasn't invited to. Celebrity couple Joe (novelist and now director) and Sally Therrian (actress) throw a party to celebrate their 6th anniversary. It's been a rocky marriage with jealousy and petty squabbling. They throw a party with "close" friends, neighbors they are feuding with and a up and coming actress that Sally feels her career threated with. It gets messy as the night goes along and lots is said and done because they are tripping on Ecstasy.   Another the-world-spins-around-me movie. I don't know which would be worse, to have be surrounded by people like them or to be them. 
 I too find it interesting that my original critique of this book disapeared. I was quite disappointed that Ann Rule recycled stories from previous novels. I think this is a waste of Ann's talent, and the readers time/money. I feel strongly that critiques are being dumped if they are not favorable.. 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 most of the book is just an advertisement for other products, although there are a few pieces of good advice in it 
 Not a great film by any means, but mildly diverting. However, all credibility is lost in one key scene.  J. Lee Thompson, director of GUNS OF NAVARONE and the original CAPE FEAR is amazing example of a man whose considerble skills deteriorated over time. This one is OK, but he degernerated even further in his later collaborations with Bronson.  The film lost it for me during a scene where the assorted characters are making an exchange of goods in a drive-in movie. The marquee says something like "Western Double Feature" and if you look at the screen, it's the same 20 second loop of a cattle stampede.   So the other moviegoers drove in not knowing the names of the movies they were seeing and were staring at the same 20 seconds of film run over and over again.  I know from fond memories that drive-ins were make-out hangouts back in the day and we didn't always focus on the movie, but this is ridiculous 
 It's ok, nothing too special. There are better ones in the marke 
 Rather bleak play with a pessimistic storyline.  Mediocre plot, mediocre characterization.  I don't recommed it 
 Negotiating Rationally seemes promising but falls short.  It provides food for thought on the interface between distributive and integrative bargaining and on biases that get in the way of a good solution.  But as a framework for negotiation, Negotiating Rationally is inadequate.  Getting to Yes is a far better structure and is easier to understand -- both for the novice and the experienced negotiator 
 It was the cryptography book at a course I am attending.  I got the impression the authors just liked 'listening' to themselves.  The instructor basically did not like the book either, but it was dictated by his higher ups.  Sorry, but I would not pay for this book 
 I wanted to like this book as it is so highly praised by people I admire.  It was a selection for our church book club and I'm glad I had exposure to Father Nouwen's interpretation of the message of the Prodigal Son, one of my favorite New Testament passages.  Unfortunately it did not arouse much spirituality in  me.  I felt that Father Nouwen overworked the connectedness between his own experiences and the biblical message.  It was a long slog  to finish the book which engendered guilt in me for not being more moved by Father Nouwen's words.  He was a dedicated and thoughtful Christian who lead an exemplary life of charity and service but his message here was diminished by repetition.  Prudent editing would have resulted in a more readable and inspirational book.   
 I think I made myself pretty clear with the title.  But, if further explanation is necessary: Theroux is exactly what he claims to abhor about tourists & travelers.  He's an egotistical, self-centered racist who has paddled aimlessly around the world in lieu of actually parenting the children he chose to have and be a husband to his original wife.  The only reason I kept reading is bc I was traveling to many of the places about which he wrote.  Additionally, I lived in HI and was interested in what he had to say about it.  Ultimately I was embarrassed that I had to share Oahu with him.  And if he mentioned one more time about his claim that scads of Japanese brides throwing themselves off hotel balconies...I mean really.  If you're looking for a fact based book about Oceania, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a self-indulgent POS about a man's traveling mid-life crisis, you can have my copy.  Thank God I only wasted a quarter on it 
 I'm sorry to say this, but this is simply a horrible book.  Gretchen Legler is too self-absorbed, too self-pitying, simply too selfish. Her grant from the NSF Artist and Writers Program surely wasn't intended to fund this whining drivel about how much her parents don't love her, about how she found lesbian love in Antarctica, about tangental ramblings that meander into nothingness.  Surely, it can't be about the prose, either. This writer, simply, uses, too, many, run-on, sentences...the overuse, of, the, comma, is, almost Shatner-esque, in, a, way.  Here is a quote...one sentence, mind you, wherein even she has to remind herself TWICE what she's writing about midway through:  "When the first bit of core, real core, not just mud from the surface, came out of the drill, says Brian Reid, one of the bearded, bright-eyed New Zealanders at Cape Roberts, telling a story over tea in the camp's galley - when the first bit of real core came out of that noise, yellow-engine-pounding room full of small, tight men with hard hats, gloves, and mud-splattered faces, when that first long roll of dark clayey material came up, and when driller Pat "The Rat" Cooper, who's drilled all over the world, when Pat himself brought the core into the drill site lab, people started yelling all around, "He hit the hard stuff, He hit the hard stuff," well, you should have just seen it - "Pat and Peter holding it and jumping up and down just like kids, just like kids, just like kids."  Good Lord.  That is ONE SENTENCE! Pages and pages and pages of this. It's maddening.   If you really want to read about life on "the ice," I strongly suggest Rolf Smith's excellent "Life on the Ice: No One Goes to Antarctica Alone," or Nicholas Johnson's "Big Dead Place: Inside the Strange and Menacing World of Antarctica."  Both are wonderful accounts of the mysterious land down south. Neither will frustrate you, nor do they care one damn bit about why some self-absorbed writer's daddy won't call her.  Boo-hoo. 
 Well, here goes. Kates previous books were interesting and I could see this being a series as big as Jordans "Wheel of Time" But it seems that she has decided to try (unsuccesfully) to gather all the loose ends in this story so that she can have a finale in the next book. There is so much information in this book it was very hard to keep afloat. Sorry but this was a sad and lackluster book, hard to read and digest 
 The Moviegoer is a book about a 30 year, disaffected businessman.  He's successful and liked, from a rich New Orleans family, but bored with life. He doesn't know what he wants, and doesn't know what to do about it.  This description, however, sounds like Binx Bolling, the main character, is actually doing something to figure out what's wrong.  Unfortunately, the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him.  While interesting from a theoretical, philosophical, existential point of view, it makes for boring reading.  In addition, the book, released in 1960 feels badly dated, about a time and place that no longer exists, so while I have experienced my own bouts of existential angst, Binx's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight. This is in stark contrast to Kafka, for example, whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century Prague can bring me to tears.    While the novel is set in New Orleans, there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets. Similarly, Binx remains a faceless everyman, and the women he dates so interchangeable that Binx himself can barely keep them distinct.  The title, too, is misleading.  "The Moviegoer" made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies.  While Binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors, I have to assume the title refers to Binx's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie.    Like the existential play "Waiting for Godot" this story is mostly about the lack of a story, and though things happen, there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward.   If you're looking for an existential novel, I'd strongly recommend Kafka's The Castle or The Trial instead.  And if you're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of New Orleans with a truly memorable set of characters, A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole) (which Walker Percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author) is among the best novels of our times.  But The Moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff.  
 For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms: David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again 
 This movie is painful to watch. I love indie films and gay and lesbian films.. but this movie is a shade better than a home movie.. the cinematography is decent, but the acting is terrible and the audio sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom... everyone delivers their lines like they're reading them right off a cue card.. their timing and delivery is horrible... the actors have no life and their on camera presence is lifeless and boring. The dialog seems like it was written halfway and the actors were asked to improvise the rest. As I said before, the poor sound quality would be distracting if there weren't so many other bad things going on. The "looks" of the actors  are mediocre, so there really isn't eye candy to make up for everything else bad in this movie... definitely not worth wasting money or time on 
 As an autobiography of a child growing up, this book is beautifully written. I read it all in one weekend. It is, however, also about the writer's mother of whom he has surprisingly intimate knowledge, given that the book is one long complaint about how she had never been there for him.  She had become a disciple of Osho, in those days known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. This intimacy, in fact, is possible because Tim Guest has forgiven his mother, and now the two enjoy a relationship which would be the envy of many sons, or daughters, who grew up in much less "deprived" situations.  The reason I rate this book so low is that the author, having failed to forgive Osho, makes a very lousy job of the biographical bits about the master (he insists on using the word guru) There are those who would feel compassion for the growing boy because he missed his mother so. I think that, being an only child, and his nature, he would have missed her anyway. If not Osho (Bhagwan), she would have been claimed by capitalism, consumerism, politics and so-called social life. I feel compassion for Tim Guest because he misses Osho so completely, in continuing to harbour bitterness, resentment, in trying to make Him out to be a charlatan. No matter though. He's still young. As time goes on he will get to see more, understand better, and make his peace with Osho also.  One thing the book proves beyond doubt. Bhagwan is far from dead, not in Tim's heart, nor in his mind. It is also certain that Tim's one book, on which he sweated and shed so many tears, will soon be fogotten; while Osho's 600 or more books, effortlessly produced, will live on.......... the 93 Rolls Royces will continue to go up in value..... and His communes around the world, having learned what was to learn from the lesson of Rajneeshpurum, will continue to thrive, prosper, grow, multiply.............. What Tim Guest, his mother, and many others have not caught on to, is that for Osho, the commune in Oregon, the cars etc  were just devices. Devices to help his disciples, and the world, to grow up.  
 I love George Gershwin tunes.   But, after listening to the first cut on disk one entitled "Prelude No.2 For Piano," my first thought was:  "You've got to be kidding, couldn't the engineers have reduced the "hiss" noise from this great collection."   Unfortunately, the problem was with my equipment. Once corrected, this CD was well worth the money spent. My vote goes from two stars to Five Stars 
 There are a lot of negative reviews already, but if mine will deter just one person from reading this book, then adding my 2 cents is worth it. Yes, there are passages of beautiful description and some intriguing characters, but these are lost amid the hundreds of pages of worthless material. One gets the impression that Tartt was trying to write a portrait of Southern childhood that would rival To Kill a Mockingbird, and that might explain the "show-offy" verbosity of her prose. I started to suspect that she collected her favorite bits from writing exercises, journals, and abandoned short stories and threw them together hoping we'd be so impressed by her language we wouldn't notice the appalling lack of plot.  No, you do not find out who killed Robin, and I'm fine with open endings when they have a purpose, but this strikes me as sheer laziness 
 The pleasure of Plato is as much from his literary as from his philosophical acumen. The choice of the public-domain Jowett translation is unhappy for bringing out the literary merit of the original. This Victorian prose, while usually competent as translation, does not ring true to the original and certainly does nothing for the late 20th century American ear. One wonders why the set is so expensive when the translation was had for nothing. And why doesn't Amazon print the contents of these cassettes in their bibliographical information. Does one have to buy the set to find out exactly what its contents are&gt 
 Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.   I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.   The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 I admire Gibson's work, but this book reflects too much intoxication and not enough theory or study of human life. The characters are transparent and the drama window dressing on a plot that never quite materializes. He hammers home a few concepts here and there, but really, nothing unifies this book except the cover. Skip it and go for one of Gibson's lucid and beautiful works like "Neuromancer" or "Pattern Recognition. 
 This book is based on on the opinion of the author and a few male "experts".  He bases his observations about women on his survey of a small group of church women who appear to represent the traditional role of the submissive stay at home wife and mother.  He never gives any other background of who these women are.  Dobson needs to wake up and realize that the traditional role of stay at home housewife is "history", even if the wife has chosen to stay at home and care for children.  Unless you are married with "traditional" roles you will likely be turned off by this book. I was. Some of Dobson's references in this book are so weak, as he seeks to show how men and women are so different from each other.  I believe that he has joined in the destuctive practice of seeking to look for how men and women are different rather than looking at our mutual needs like respect, emotional support, communication and loyalty. I gave this book one star because there are some parts that are interesting, it's just a shame that Dobson put this book out with the title it has.  Women and men should read this book with a very critical mind, if at all 
 The weird thing is, I rented this movie from BLOCKBUSTER!  Ok, I wrote a really good scathing review but the darn thing went into limbo. Will try to recreate.  If you are looking for porn, soft or hardcore, keep looking. This movie promises so much and delivers so little. No one wears corsets, as promised on the cover. In fact, that scene is nowhere in the movie.  "Surrender" is confusing, disjointed and a very big disappointment. I don't know where they got the plot summary on the back cover because there is more plot there than in the whole movie. I won't be giving anything away by pointing out a few things as there is nothing to give away! Murder mystery? Ok a couple cops come to the house. That was it. Georgia, from Alabama, is a naive innocent woman who comes to visit a woman she somehow knows, in LA. We are only told on the cover that the LA woman is a writer. Georgia is so innocent that we see a tattoo on her shoulder, and she has, we think, sex with the vet on the kitchen counter the first day. I say I THINK she has sex, there is some rough nudity, but there is no indication of it. Later in the movie, in the MIDDLE of sex, Georgia lights a cigarette! Oh, and all they do is light cigarettes in the movie, by the way. Also, this innocent woman initiates the "forbidden relationship" with her friend. Oh, and the summary promises that the Dominatrix leaves the "lifestyle" and the "innocent" becomes the Dominatrix. Well, I must have blinked during the movie a few times, because what was promised I missed.  If you are looking for S&M - keep looking. There isn't much, and what is there is gratuitous. If you are looking for porn, just read the back summary. Only there will you be at all teased and aroused. It is not even worthy of the soft porn channel.  Not since "Open Water" has over an hour of my life been so wasted 
 You better know photoshop before you buy this book,because the author doesn't tell you were some of selections are in photoshop. Plus after I managed to make some of the textures which did look good in photoshop, they looked terrible in Maya7 when I rendered the scene. Some of the textures I can not complete because I dont know photoshop that well and I have no idea what the author is talking about or were the selections are that I need to use.. 
 Only about 20% of this book is about baseball.  If the author didn't have his own agenda, it could have been closer to 80 or 90%.    The best parts of the book are Appendix 1 (almost all SABR material) and the annotated bibliography.  A good idea squandered 
 "Over done" is the best way to describe this over-the-top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a "stolen" video camera.  
 Why buy Iolo System Mechanic when you can get malware for free? I installed Pro 7 and it gave many, many problems. Iolo did not respond to my emails so I uninstalled. Their uninstaller did not work either 
 I agree with the previous reviewer - the belt clip works fine overall.  However, I dinged the product way more b/c you have to remove it EVERY time you want to turn your Shuffle on or off.  It would be one thing if it were every time you needed to charge the Shuffle or reload songs (which you also have to do), but this is twice every single time you want to use your Shuffle, which for me is 4 or 5 times a week.  That's just not practical.  Frankly I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't consider that when they designed the belt clip, and I wish I had known about it before I bought it 
 Since the main tenet of the Priory of Scion as proposed in "Holy Blood Holy Grail" and novelized in "The Da Vinci Code" has been effectively discredited, I was intent on sticking to real proto-Christian scholarship like that of Bart Ehrman and Ahmed Osman, but since the authors indicated that they had a true Sang Real/Royal Blood descendant as a source implying an actual interview, I gave this book a chance. There is little detail from the interviews with "Michael" in which he was to "verify some of [the authors] allegations". He apparently did not provide the authors with any documentary evidence to support his claims. Instead the authors mostly tell us what other alternative authors got correct and incorrect, which only really amounts to more presumption and conjecture. I tried to find some means to correspond with the authors but they are as unavailable to us as their source. You can learn what these and other authors say about Rex Deus through Wikipedia.com. 
 Though I had never seen nor heard The Inspector General, I thought I would purchase this DVD because I am a Danny Kaye fan. Unfortunately, after the first 15 minutes, I was ready to turn it off. The story was very slow, with Danny Kaye coming off as obnoxious, not witty. The songs were weak. There were a few moments of an occasional snort of laughter, but they were far and few between. This film must have been found in the farthest back shelf of the dusty film archives of forgetable films 
 This book is way overated.  Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer.  It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed "physicists."   So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian.  I think the whole world must have been duped.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague 
 Be careful because this book is in Spanish even if you may note this information only enlarging the picture or, as in my case, when you receive the book at your home. Hopefully that might not be too bad a problem due to the repetitive nature of the sayings of the Buddha and my mother language but I would give a word of warning to anyone with a different background 
 While I adore YA novels about queer kids, this one left me a little underwhelmed.  I was just never convinced that Lissa and Kate were real people --- the character development was nil.  I also didn't believe that they actually felt something for one another --- it was kind of like a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, where all of the ingredients for a romantic comedy are there, but there's just no chemistry; it's not convincing.  For a really good read, rely on the old classic Annie On My Mind --- a book which I still practically keep under my pillow, and which convinced my mom (!) that maybe, maybe this lesbian thing was OK 
 Chapter 2. Apparently I'm a member of "the Petrified Forest," a.k.a. those of us who have chosen not to have children. Now, despite Mr. Bronson's claim that "parenthood is on trial," in the world where I live as a married woman with no kids, parenthood is largely believed to be the default position everyone is expected to take, unless they are unmarried or medically infertile. Because that's the case, I'm aware that the decision not to have children is considered strange to some people, and would probably normally have passed this by. However, Bronson's raison d'etre here is the telling of people's life stories in order to "answer life's biggest questions." It strikes me as rather telling, then, that in the course of this he is willing to dismiss and stereotype an entire group of people, all of them individuals with their own reasons and their own stories, with a page of mockery and a glib label. If he's so casual and quick to judge on this issue, I can't really take the rest of his insights too seriously. 
 Although the script was written in the mid-1980s, "Bob Roberts" doesn't feel dated. Instead it feels like it was written today about the current state of American politics. The title character, Bob, is a conservative folk singer who runs for the U.S. Senate, but the cynical political machinations easily belong to politicians of any stripe. What struck me after watching this movie was how easily lead and deluded we are as citizens. While I thought that the message of the movie was right on target, I didn't care as much for the mock documentary style of the film. It kept me at a distance from the characters and, as a result, I didn't care as much about them as I might have done 
 The composer did a great job of putting the exact songs from the movie onto the cd.  The reason I gave this two stars is because I don't like the music.  They all sound the same and the music gets redundant.  Most of the music is crashes and clanks to me.  Basically its just noise.  I recommend the tracks: Prologue/Main Title/Hockey Mask , Dad's Death/The Pier/Matchbook/ Tina Summons/Dan's Death , and End Credit.  The cover art looks like it took 10 minutes to make.  If you like the music from these films then get it while you can because its a limited soundtrack.  The cover art looks like it took 10 minutes to make 
 there are many reasons to rip apart this movie, there are enough holes that even NEW YORK rats could go through.  however, what this movie lacks, it makes up for with a nice presentation, bonus features and really good special effects.  the story is slim-unstable serum.  there is govermental paranoia, rediculous chases, cheese nudity, a slight look of HALLOWEEN(from the persons POV)--sort of DARKMAN look and feel to the actors in their roles, several nice killings and the typical no brainer ending(SEQUEL) hmmn?, the movie company was lucky it was filming on a dark dreary rainy days!!-lol.  movie is not bad. its better than most if you want to be entertained.   just try not to get too involved.  RENT IT.  
 All Volumes Reviewed: Is this the work of Michel Foucault, the author of "Order of Things," "Discipline and Punish," and "Archeology of Knowledge?" Surely, this must be a hoax. Foucault is notoriously provocative, keenly insightful, and always virulent. So what happened here? Hardly much of a history, anything but provocative, entirely pedestrian, already outdated, and woefully incomplete. Accessibility is not a problem, unlike "Archeology of Knowledge," but truly lacking in information, perspective, and relevance. Compare, for example, this trite and superficial reading with Compton's expansive and exhaustive "Homosexuality and Civilization." After all, Foucault was gay and into sado-masochism. The two are incomparable. A complete waste of time (since I was sure Foucault had something quixotic to write over three volumes), but hope never materialized into reality. Key theme: Sex is a power relation. Maybe for Foucault and his preoccupation with S&M, but some men, gay and straight, find romantic love, passion, intimacy, tenderness, and yes, by golly, love-making culminates in the sex act. How did we get it wrong? PASS 
 I know that others have given high praise but I found the information to be very out of date, such as a bike trail that has been paved for over 10 years listed as crushed rock and a museum showing in the location it was over ten years ago. This 3rd edition has a 2001 copyright and I expect information to be fairly up-to-date. This was a very disappointing purchase. I am not using it because I doubt the reliability. It looks nice but is not a good reference for my needs 
 If you like fluffy bunny new age crap,then this book is for you. However if you like reality then overlook this book. The part that made me the angriest was when she said that it was okay to kill plants for food,but not animals,and that we didnt need protein in our diet. If you want to eat,you have to kill something to eat,unless you want to destroy your body by putting artificial substances in it.  This book was so awful that I couldnt even finish it 
 You know, after REALLY trying to like this album, I must agree with K Johnson. Oftentimes a really good album sounds horrible (or just plain plain) upon one or three spins, so when this album didn't move me the first time, I decided to hang back and try again in a few days. Then again. And again. And one more time. Usually after three or four COMPLETE spins (which was like work, with this one)the jems will work there way to the surface. Sufjian Stevens was like that. So was Z by My Morning Jacket. But the problem was that I really wanted to like this one. All the reviews I read were hyping this as the album of the decade, and I wanted them to be right. Unfortunately, none of them were right. It is a plodding, lifeless album wanting desperately to be 'hip' and failing miserably, to the point of being embarassing almost. Like your 40 something hipster college prof with a graying ponytail (who will LOVE this, by the way), it will be pointless to argue with those who like this album. I have to say that it is obvious these guys put a lot of work into this, and they do have talent; it just doesn't get me there. I hope they can live up to the hype next time. I truly do.. 
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 Tim Burton's "Big Fish" totally out-Spielbergs Spielberg in the syrup-overdose department.  Aunt Jemima herself would watch this movie and say, "whoa, honey, easy on the sugar!"  If I've ever beheld a soppier, kitschier, more incomprehensibly sentimental, make-every-play-in-the-movie-playbookfor-your-heartstrings movie, I seriously cannot remember it.  This movie would make the writers of Hallmark cards turn scarlet with embarrassment (and envy).  It's the sappiest afterschool special ever made as narrated by Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland, etc.)  It's especially bizarre because it's like Tim Burton's own variation of 'Forrest Gump', and Tim Burton is usually never one to kautau to the conservative Hallmark-card Hollywood mainstream (but then again, I've never seen 'Edward Scissorhands').    Granted, as historic Hollywood sell-outs go, it isn't as horrifyingly abysmal as Gus Van Sant's 'Good Will Hunting' - at least it doesn't take itself *that* seriously and morosely and self-importantly.  There are some aspects of its southern-Gothic, teller-of-tall-tales rambunctiousness that might be endearing in concept (and of course the terminal-illness theme rarely fails to be compelling); but in Tim Burton's hands it's like an LSD-addicted animator at DC Comics got ahold of a charming little short story anthology by Mark Twain and blew it out of proportion by 1,000,000,000%.  There is *nothing* understated in this movie - this movie doesn't have the slightest idea what the word "understated" even means! (Well, okay, there's one scene where Jessica Lange slips into a bathtub with her clothes on, and that might've been my favorite in the entire movie...and it's funny, because that was probably one of the cheapest scenes to film - no insanely distracting & over-the-top special FX, etc.)  One of the things I do think 'Big Fish' gets at very well is no matter how much we think we may have our parents figured out, they will always have surprises and hidden truths that we can never anticipate, which is a lovely sentiment.  And most of the time I felt like the movie had its heart in the right place.  But dear god almighty, if there is a wing at the Hazelden Clinic for Maudlin Syrup Detox, I need to check into it ASAP.  
 This is a manual a ballet teacher might use. It's definately NOT something you give your daughter who's already in ballet. There are hardly NO pictures. It's mosting words. What good is an instructional book about ballet without pictures to show you the correct positions. Very disappointing 
 It's quality is cheap and poorly made.  I bought two thinking it was a good deal but I threw them out after 2 days because the on/off switch didn't work.  It was also very loud 
 Was hoping this would be a lot of fun for my 9 year old, and her younger brothers, too.  Forget it.  Extremely overwhelming for beginner dancers and fair-to-middlin' dancing moms, too.  The moves are cool, no doubt.  But my kids won't even attempt it. The coordination is not there.  NOT, NOT, NOT begginner friendly.  Too fast and too hard 
 This little book includes four stories -- "James in a Mess", "Bertie's Chase", "Percy and the Signal"  and "Percy Proves a Point".  Each story is accompanied by photographs from the video series.  My complaint is that the stories are confusing and not well told 
 This book is very poorly written. There are grammatical errors, lots of repetition, and so much awkward writing that I, my grandfather and my stepfather all had to put it down.   I think the only reason this book gets such good reviews is that it is one of the more easily-accessible books on the subject. As soon as there are more mainstream books on the topic, this one will fall by the wayside 
 I love the idea of this product. Like many of the other reviewer's I don't have the regular traditional style crib. Our crib converts to a toddler bed. This product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs. I would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one's that are more with the current styles of cribs, like mine's. 
 Let me just start by saying I really like math, but this book did not help me to learn biostatistics at all.  It doesn't explain the issues and equations very well and it has absolutly no answers in the back to check with yours, that's a whole other book...and that only has answers to the odds.  Perhaps this would be a decent book for anyone who already has a handle on the subject and wants to learn more, but if this is your first exposure to biostatistics, like me, try another source to learn from, this book makes a difficult subject near impossible 
 Why release WrestleMaina's that are already on dvd? Anther thing WrestleMaina is months away, it was a perfect time to release the big four in order. Survivor Series entire series, then Royal Rumble, then WrestleMaina, and finally Summerslam. Made sense but WWE really doesnt think well sometimes. 
 It seems that the author is preaching to the engineering choir because it is written for people who seem to already know the subject.  Furthermore, it seems that the author has a sick desire to tell everyone how smart he is by taking a simple subject and making it as hard as possible. There is no intention of teaching the subject and its only purpose is to tell you that it exists.  With the exception of a few good tables/examples, much of the writing and diagrams are crammed in an endless, sloppy soup of paragraphs and over inflated jargon.  Concepts are NOT taught in a structured, simplistic, thorough, or systematic approach, so using this book as a quick reference would be difficult as well.  Problem examples are few and are buried within the text.  I did NOT find any humor in the pages but did find the material to be as exciting as watching paint dry.  Concept instruction, which seems simple at first, quickly degenerates to the point that the rest of the chapter no longer makes any sense.  Freshman students in Computer Science, who are forced to use this book by their university, will find it difficult to comprehend to the point of becoming discouraged and thinking this major is not for them.  I highly recommend finding a supplement to this book and purchasing a used copy if its use is mandatory 
 I was quite disappointed with this one.  First of all the book's ending is very grim.  I agree with another reviewer when they said they'd rather be left imagining what kind of messes Arthur and Ford were getting themselves into now.  And so many unanswered questions!  What happened to Fenchurch and why didn't Arthur care more about what happened to her?  What happened to Zaphod?  Colin the robot?  What is the question to the answer 42?  What was Fenchurch's idea that would solve the world's problems?  What was the point to the people on Rupert?  It's worth reading just to be able to finish off the series and because it's still well written and funny just like the others.  But be prepared to be disappointed by the loose ends and finale.  
 This translation is completely unfaithful to the original.  This copy cannot be prayed or medidated with.  It's attempt to use modern language and expressions destroyed the beauty of this classic.  It is not any easier to read than more faithful translations 
 The book was just too short, without enough information.  If you cut out the part on hunting, the biography (both are parts I"m not really interested in as a 3-D target shooter), their wasn't a great deal left.  Good information on tuning and the author's technique I guess, but he could have added a lot more to clarify.  It's like the book didn't have an editor 
 Okay, so this book isn't THAT bad, but there are better organization books that take a little longer to implelement but work much better in the long run.  I recommend that teenagers should instead read the FlyLady cleaning book and use the control journal idea in conjunction with this book to keep their room clean.  They must devise their own system and that takes a lot of time and trial and error, but this book won't solve all of the organization problems, it needs more.  Trust me, I am 15, I spend about 10 minutes a day keeping my room neat, and it is always perfect.  I also have tons of time for everything I want to do 
 This book could have been written by any party affiliate decrying the state of the media in favor for the other party.We all know about the use of statistics and anecdotal evidence and the authors hate-mongering against Conservatives leads little credibility to use of such devices. If you're a Democratic (or someone who writes reviews and says I'm a Conservative, but...) this book is going to help you account for the tremendous beatings you've taken in the polls and your increasing loss of popularity across the nation. If you're a Republican you're going to see it as another whine-and-moan fest of democrats trying to explain, once again, how they are victims.The author is a partisan who generates diviseness between parties so he can gin up book sales.  In both cases, you know exactly what you are getting 
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, "Rx for Health"?  I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten.  I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative.  I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex.  I had thought it was gluten-free!  I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394,  Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication.  Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list.  I contacted Pfizer....no gluten!  I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten!   There are many responsible guides for celiacs.  Lowell's book is certainly not one of them 
 if you like this book, more power to you. i wish you well. but, please: shame on the modern library editorial board for choosing this thing as the 8th greatest novel of the 20th century! ridiculous. there is nothing special about the writing, and the whole book is such a heavy-handed ideological sermon, that it is more like a dark dreary pondorous cartoon i wish i had taken no part of. if you like ugly literature, this will be for you.                 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 I think I found what you are searching for!  Found right here on Amazon.com is a book by Louise Derman-Sparks called Teaching/Learning  Anti-Racism.  Hope it helps.  The cost seems very decent 
 I have several Sony products (TV, Stereo, VCR) and yes they all work wonderfully with this remote - didn't even have to program those devices.  The problem I had was when I tried to program my DVD player.  There were only codes for 10 other brands! I have 4 DVD players and this didn't work on any.  I decided to upgrade an older memorex model with a new sony.  Yes, it did work, but some of the functionality was quirky.  If you press the DVD function button while the DVD is on... the remote will turn it off. So if you want to switch from the stereo or tv functions back to controlling the DVD, you'd better put your hand over the transmitter or it will shut off the DVD player while your watching it.  Didn't even work with my genaric analog cable box 
 The thing that attracted me most to this book was the cover: a big alien head with those beady eyes that would make any earthling cringe.  Throughout this review, I will be as objective as possible about Strieber's experience, and NOT to bring about what I really believe about alien life.  The beginning of the book opens up in Streiber's and his wife's log cabin out in the middle of nowhere.  He goes on to recount his rituals in the cabin (such as checking under beds, in closets, etc), and explains his encounter with the visitors.  I must admit, he does do a creepy job of telling about the visitors.  But of course, he is a writer of suspense novels.  The next section of the book tells of another encounter, and gets creepier.  Streiber does a great job of setting atmopshere and such.  However, the middle of the book gets to be strange: you have to bear through a couple hundred of pages of transcripts of Streiber's hypnosis sessions.  Streiber's accounts make sense, but the subsequent hypnosis section from his wife have nothing really to do with anything.  Her testimony in no way corroborates with his, and she is utterly confused during the whole session-- which is obvious by her "I don't know" responses and the leading questions asked by the non-doctor present.  Streiber has included his polygraph test (which he passed) at the end of this book.  After reviewing it, I must say that the questions they asked were not logically fit at all.  For instance, one read: "Do you believe that events happened to you on ... such and such a date?"  He answered yes, and was evaluated to have told the truth.  Of course if someone is asked if he believes something happened to him (and if he is as ardent to believe it as Streiber), then he will without a doubt pass the question.  A more appropriate question to ask would be whether or not Streiber believed that aliens took him or not on such and such a night.  Another fact to the matter is that all of these experiences could possibly be dreams.  He claims the little visitors took him when he asleep NEXT to his wife, in the first chapter.  What is to make his wife not wake up?  Or, more importantly, what is to stop him from not screaming for his wife?  Much of everything he accounts make no sense at all.  In conclusion, there were too many holes.  The only testimony that was presented relevantly was Streiber's.  His wife's and son's was a jumble of a mess, and fit in no where in terms of corroborating with Streiber's experience.  Read this if you want a good scare; but not if you want to believe; it will leave you more confused than when you first opened it.  
 It's hard to believe that a book by a fundamentalist Christian about the Devil could be this dull.  Usually the field of Satan-sniffing produces works filled with amusement, even hilarity, and massive evidence of human  credulity.  This book has only a vast vast number of Bible verses and a few  anecdotes so un-lurid that they wouldn't even interest Pastor Fletcher  Brothers on a dull day.  It does, however, provide a good groundwork for  understanding the philosophical basis of the fundy attitude towards demons  - if you happen to care 
 first off, i'm a fan.  admittedly not as big a fan as i once was - it's a far cry from the halcyon days of music for the masses/ violator - but a fan nonetheless.  all of which makes this painful to write. a lot of people have dubbed this a return to form, a comment which does an extreme disservice to 'exciter'.  despite featuring one of the most toe-curlingly embarrassing moments of dm's history ('dead of night' - shudder - a song so bad it wouldn't have even got onto 'ultra') for all it's flaws it managed to hold the attention. this album tries to maintain a similar laidback, low key vibe to the likes of the excellent 'comatose', 'i feel loved'.  the problem with 'playing the angel' is that the tunes are somewhat...tepid.  there's very little in the way of instant tunes, and crucially it seems to be lacking in growers too.  where dm try to write a song that harks back to the glory days, they're let down by a lack of, for want of a better word, a hook.  best example of this is 'the sinner in me' which, after initial promise, limps to a chorus that falls flat in spectacular (or unspectacular, to be precise) fashion.  'precious' comes off as a poor man's 'enjoy the silence' and 'microcosm' and 'damaged people' are just, well, awful.  the rest just feel somehow half-hearted. it's not all bad.  'i want it all' and 'nothing's impossible' WORK, and 'the darkest star' gets points for trying.  despite this i can't help but feel there's an alan wilder shaped hole in the proceding 
 Those familiar with the Battle of Midway will find nothing new here.  On the contrary, the book is so full of errors and misconstructions of fact that it only further distorts the reasons behind the tragic slaughter of the U.S. torpedo planes and their aircrews during this famous battle.  Much of the technical information cited in this book is outdated, inaccurate, or incorrectly analyzed, leading to erroneous errors and conclusions throughout the text.  Readers wanting to know the real story to the U.S. torpedo planes would be better off obtaining a reprint of Lord's classic work Incredible Victory, Lundstrom's First Team, or the newly released Shattered Sword by Parshall and Tully 
 I will start off by admitting I did not read this entire book. As someone who has struggled with severe depression since I was seventeen, the first few chapters made me angry, nauseated, and eventually frightened.  This book will serve to fuel prejudice and contempt towards suicidal people, by claiming it's something that can be averted with a lollipop and a pat on the head; a hysterical search for attention.  Obviously the writer did have serious emotional difficulties; but most suicides are committed by people with physical, chemical, mental illnesses, as dangerous and as un-asked for as diabetes or cancer.  If you want to know WHY, read Kay Redfield Jamison's "Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide".  If you want to know how to make it go away, I still don't have an answer, and I can't trust anyone who claims there's an easy one 
 sensationalist, titiliating, and as a result, a total let-down (much like "heavier than heaven")  while Cross's journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re: Jimi's early years, after that, it reads like "Hammer of the Gods" meets the National Inquirier.  just plain silly, and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever.  Cross spends more time examining Jimi's proclivity for groupies and drugs (which, of course, is part of the story...i guess), than the music itself.  It would have been nice to know, say:  In 1966, preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame NYC, how did Hendrix come to write the songs that comprised "Are You Experienced"?  how did his playing transcend his predecessors?  how did dylan influence his songwriting?  (we learn Hendrix *did* emulate Dylan's hair.)  we don't know.  now, if Cross was unable to formulate  answers on his own, then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics, musicians, and fans who'd be happy to extrapolate.    instead we get only crumbs, which are ultimately overshadowed by second-hand stories from druggies ("jimi didn't like alcohol!", ex-groupies ("jimi wanted to marry me!", and hangers-on ("jimi slept with 8 chicks at once.")  it was thorougly exasperating.  if you came from Mars and read this, your impression would be that yes, Jimi was messed up and reckless; but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world.  if the book meant to honor Hendrix, it did the opposite.    if you want incisive analysis of the *music* itself, simply read Amazon readers' reviews of his records.  The fans themselves -- not an overwrought author -- can encapsulate the power and beauty of Hendrix far better, and far more consisely. 
 I have seen a lot of erotic photograph books wanting to become a photograph myself. I would have to say this is one of the worst. The book is book in size, but each photograph is the size of and is a poloroid. The pictures are blurry many times and so small it is hard to tell anything about the context of the picture. This book was a waste of paper and will be a waste of your time 
 Denice and I grew up in the same small town in Oklahoma. It is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death. This heinous crime not only shook Ada, but also shook those of us who grew up with her in Purcell,OK. Denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room. She was a year behind me in school. I recently pulled out a old High School annual. Looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories. Memories of a beautiful, innocent young woman who's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye. As important as it is that justice has been served in this case, it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget Denice.     
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 TaxCut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete, nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand.  Many terms of art are not defined at all.    Most disturbingly, when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $54.95 for both state and federal filing,  but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file, the only options listed at checkout time are $29.95 for federal and another $29.95 charge for the state filing.    This bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for H&R Block, unfortunately.  I called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $5.  I told them that I thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal, and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice.    Finally, the program crashed several times while I was using it.   Although the data was always saved, it was quite obnoxious.  I run a high-performance, well-maintained Mac PowerBook, so I'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly.    next year I'll go with TurboTax. 
 I can't comment as to the author's accuracy with regard to the magical characteristics of animals, but I will say that Ms. Conway needs to go back to high school and take introductory biology.  Much of the information that she presents with regard to the biological and behavioral attributes of several animals is simply false.  How exactly is one to commune with animals when one is so astoundingly ignorant as to their nature?  Why is it that all of these fluffy-New-Age-white-light witches think that they're also zoologists 
 I saw this movie quite a few years ago (probably about 15 or 20 years ago). I must say the first time I saw it I wasn't really impressed. Then I read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that Marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie. So when it was released on DVD I went out and purchased it. I remember little about it from the first time other than it had Sissy Spacek in it in one of her first roles, if not her very first big screen role. I must say that I didn't find this movie any better now than I did then. I appreciate Marvins career and his acting as well as Gene Hackman. These two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good. The story could have been much better and the core of it is good. Marvin is a respected Chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by Eddie Egan (the real Popeye Doyle from the French Connection drug bust in New York) to collect $500,000 that an associate name Mary Ann has forgotten to pay. Mary Ann (Gene Hackman... and don't ask me why he is Mary Ann cause they never explain it) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house. He has sent back several other bag men to the Chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them. Mary Ann also is now with Marvins old flame Clarabell (Jeez what is with these stupid names?). Mary Ann also deals in white slavery, enter Sissy Spacek. He sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows.   This is an interesting novelty kind of movie. If you are a fan of Marvin or Hackman check it out. Even if you are a fan of Sissy Spacek. But alas this movie is just not that good. The old school mob vs the new middle America mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie. 
 i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips! 
 This product is not fit for use in any circumstance.  It Definately Looks Great - But thats it!  The product (can't call it a gun) Broke in the first 5 hours of use, NOT COMBAT, play use with reasonalby responsible youngsters.  I am Extremely Dissapointed with the quality of the product.  I wrote two letters to the seller/manufacturer rep and no repsonse yet.  Not surprised.  My son decided to spent 20 extra dollars on his replacemnt purchase and it WAS WELL WORTH IT.   We did not repeat buy and won't.  Learn from our mistake 
 I really wish I had read the book flap before buying this book.  Had I read that it had anything to do with NASCAR, I would have put it down and spent my $25+ on another book....my mistake.  The ONLY reason I actually read the whole book is because I did pay $25+ for it and just felt like I should.  It was not entertaining and just dragged on and on.  So, not only was it dull and slow, it was about NASCAR...a sport and subject that is just not my cup of tea.  I love the Stephanie Plum series and will continue to purchase Evanovich books in that series, but will not buy anything else 
 I would give this -5 stars.  After sitting through about 20 minutes, I gave up on seeing anything remotely entertaining 
 It's beyond me how Mr. Schaeffer continues to find funding for his self-indulgent films.  He seems to think he's the Woody Allen for the new millennium, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Having seen two of his previous efforts, I should have known better than to give "Wirey" a try.  But I'm a forgiving soul, and I watched it.  Assuming that Mr. Schaeffer's repeated use of himself as a leading man reflects an autobiographical bent to his work, he's a misogynistic, selfish jerk who seems to think that everyone else should be interested in his inability to find romantic happiness.  Note to Eric:  Just because you know you're a jerk, that doesn't make it okay to be a jerk.  A line from "Search and Destroy" also comes to mind: "Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting."  Avoid this film like the plague 
 I enjoyed Priest's earlier book "The Prestige." I forced myself to plow through "The Seperation," expecting something would happen. Nothing does. It's not an "alternate history." It's about the lives of identical twins Jack and Joe from the 1936 Olympics up to Rudolf Hess's peace offer (from Germany to Britain) in May 1941. The first bit of the book speculates what would have happened if Churchill had accepted Hess's offer, but the rest of the book is pre-May 1941.   E.M. Forster once wrote that the #1 rule for a novelist is to make the reader want to know what is going to happen to the characters on the next page. Priest didn't follow that rule. It's not that Jack and Joe lead boring lives. They compete in the Olympics, one is shot down in World War Two, etc. But the writing is so slow and drawn out that I couldn't care.   The novel did make me curious about the spring of 1941, when Britain and Germany were the only countries in the war. The Soviet Union and the United States hadn't yet entered the war. Did Germany really make peace offers to Britain, which Churchill refused? How would history have been different if, say, Chamberlain had been Prime Minister and accepted Hitler's offer 
 I purchased this book for my 2nd grade classroom.  With a few exceptions, the kids didn't want to take the time necessary to color in all the designs.  They didn't mind doing the math, it was only the coloring that they rushed through.  I was disappointed because it seemed like a way to work some fun into the math lesson, but alas, it didn't work out that way 
 Not only should you not buy this book you shouldnt even open it.Karim Rashid deserves great credit for his ability to fool corporations and college freshmen into buying into his vision of a hot pink world but as far as design goes, he is a joke, his "look" was over in 1995 six months after it started. Anyone with a 3d modeling program on there home computer could produce this work. Take a shape, close your eyes, punch some keys on your computer, color it purple, call it a vase,lamp,chair,whatever and voila the Karim Rashid formula. The entire book almost is made not of photos but of computer generated images, this stuff doesnt even exist(thank God). He needs to go back to Canada or Egypt, repurchase the 40,000 records he supposidly "threw in the trash" and pick up his gig as the DJ he really is and leave the designing to the designers. Shame on the ignorant people out there who cant see the Emperor is naked 
 Others have written many of the same words I would have used so I will be brief. I grabbed this book based on a mention from John Grogan in the Marley book. Katz is not nearly as pure of a dog owner. He seems to take pleasure in recounting his practiced dominance over his dogs. He claims to adore them but uses force and physical punishment while explaining how lucky they are to have him. In my mind, the dogs seem like experiments. This book is more about Katz than it is about the dogs. A lot of ego on display. I didn't come away with warm regard for the author. 
 The absurdly obvious title should be enough to tell you: this book is painful.  From the outset, the characters are all completely stock, thus assuming the reader already knows who they are, thereby releiving the author of developing them significantly.  In keeping with this bland characters, their problems seem to be little more than dopey whinning and fail to be anything more than annoying.  The plot is VERY predictable and I found I was just waiting for the expected outcomes to run their course: Devlin's self-absorbtion does him in, Max's inner goodness helps him adapt to the situation, Zeffy and Tia are set up to become big stars after overcoming self-doubt, the mother becomes more confident with the help of a new lover and the teenage daughter meanders through standard teenager problems before spontaniously deciding to grow up at the end.  Don't feel like I've blown the ending- its obvious from the get go.  I admit this is the only De Lint novel I've ever read, but I don't feel like reading another 
 This book tells you nothing about collections that you haven't already seen in the movies & with your mental sterotypes.  It borders on criminality ...  I recommend it to convicts & gangsters 
 I REPEAT: WHY THE HELL IS THIS BEING SOLD FOR SUCH A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY ??? IF ANYONE ORDERED THIS FROM THIS SELLER FOR THIS AMOUNT...LOAD A GUN AND END IT NOW ..... -CHRI 
 First and foremost this book is listed as a "hardcover" edition. This collection, in point of fact, consists of 4 paperbound books with a cardboard slipcover.  Secondly, there are no traditional recipes with a list of ingredients followed or accompanied by instructions for preparing the dish. "Recipes" are one paragraph descriptions that list the amount, the ingredient itself, and directions all in the same sentence. Regarding the structure of the individual volumes (Meat, Poultry & Game, Fish & Seafood, Vegetables & Salads, and Desserts) they are divided into chapters covering a major subgroup. For example, in the Meat Volume there is a chapter on Chicken. Within each chapter recipes are listed alphabetically. The authors, in my opinion, have haphazardly mixed recipe titles to include usage of english and foreign names. For example, there is a recipe titled "Chicken Liver Flan Chavette" indiscriminately mixing english, spanish and french terms.   The recipes themselves leave a lot to be desired. As an example the above cited "Chicken Liver Flan Chavette" recipe starts out: "Bake a flan case (pie shell) blind. Thickly slice 500 g (18 oz) trimmed chicken livers. Season and saute in hot butter." There are no cross references to where the recipe for a flan case appears (which it doesn't as far as I could find) and the instructions to saute in "hot butter" are useless. It would be more instructive if the authors had considered a statement such as "saute over medium heat until golden brown". Very little thought and testing was used to list these recipes.  I would give this book a "0 star" rating if it were available!      
 Horribly, horribly disappointing.  Books that simply trash another opposing theory (think US politics in 2004) without coming up with solid ideas of their own is not nearly as interesting as original/positive thesis.  Smith spends a huge chunk of the book doing just that and portraying scientists as soulless students of dead matter.  Really, if Smith's version of science was truly the dominant cultural paradigm, 5 percent instead of 95 percent of Americans would believe in God. In addition, he takes superficial examples from other cultures and uses them to defend his monotheism (an underlying Christianity, based on some passages).  While I agree with the author that tolerance without thinking is just as bad as  intolerance, using native cultures as examples and then arguing that there is an absolute religious Truth (not a spiritual truth) is difficult to swallow.  Sorry, you can't have both.  In addition, the writing is generally chaotic in the last half -the author seems to be trying to squeeze his life work into a few pages.  Again, Huston Smith has MANY better books out there that treat the world's religions with more respect 
 I had high hopes for this book after hearing Ms. Jentz interviewed.  Unfortunately, it's mostly just navel-gazing.  Her thoughts and feelings might hold my interest -- if they had been focused enough.  This book has an intriguing story to tell:  the attack on Ms. Jentz and her friend, their reasons for riding across America, and Ms. Jentz's later search for the perpetrator and the reasons the case was never solved.  Unfortunately, the book is very heavily burdened with navel gazing and overwrought prose.  This would have been a nice, tight story at 200 pages.  At 500, it's bloated.  An editor is desperately needed.  Large portions of the book seem to be virtually lifted verbatim from the author's journals.  We find out how she feels about EVERYTHING that happens.  You get to hear about every little gesture and movement as if they are important.  I don't care what evil portent for the future is contained in the color of a road sign.  Everything is burdened with dense discussion of feelings and everything seems to portend ... something -- virtually always (of course:  99%+ of life is just happenstance) leads nowhere and is never mentioned again.  Here are some examples:  Navel gazing: "Rather, because I wanted her to pay attention; I wanted her to reach in and touch me in response to this life-changing event.  (And anyway, hadn't she helped save me too?  Without her energizing presence fighting for life, I might have bled to death in that place.)  No.  It wasn't about the saving.  I wanted her to let me into her psyche, as she had lodged in mine.  Something, however small, was missing in the room that night -- an unrequited something or another -- a missing moment that followed me with the fidelity of a shadow for a very long time."  (p. 106)  (Gaaaakkk!)  Overwrought prose: "The desert is a holy void, all essentials burned away.  It has a presence as powerful as the ocean, a raw force that acts on us, puts us under the influence of what we cannot control."  (p. 70)  What does this have to do with the story?  Has she read The Desert (Van Dyke), Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Arabian Sands, or even the Bible?  "Perhaps a fascination with transgressive excess, our seduction by the spectacle of power, goes some distance in explaining why Americans are in swoon, why the movies, books, and popular music dwell on criminals, particularly killers of the serial or mass-murdering variety."  (p. 158)  Please!  So much of this stuff is larded amongst the story, I just stopped caring after a while.  These kind of things have to comprise at least 50% of the book.  Some entire chapters are made up of this.  I found myself skipping entire paragraphs all the time (oh God, more of that!).  So, you're thinking, oh, he's just a MAN, they have no feelings and don't care about feelings.  Well, no.  I like a good, emotionally charged book.  However, I don't care to hear about how she felt when remembering how she felt at age 4 when she found her pet beetle dead.  I read many sections of this book aloud to my wife and she thought them ludicrous.  If you enjoy slogging through another's every little emotion and thought, regardless of relevance, you may enjoy this book.  Maybe it's therapeutic self-help for some traumatized readers.  But for me, the story just gets lost in the mess 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 All the sources show in this book are easily found in website and those sources are not really will help you maximize your profit because most of the sources you need to pay monthly fees. Better think twice when you purchase this book, I already waste my time and money to own this book. Good luck on yo 
 I decided to rent this after reading a few good reviews and hearing some decent things about her. I truly believe I have a good sense of humor and find comedy in all aspects of life. I do not get offended when watching any comedian.  There are very few stand up comics that I do not find funny in some way.  However, I was dismayed to realize that I just did not find 95% of this dvd funny. The jokes are slow coming and it even has some serious moments when she touches on some dead friends and gay marriage. Sure, there was a joke at the end of each, but I prefer stand up comics to deliver jokes a littler quicker than 1 every 3 minutes. It's as if she decided to use the recording of the show to get a serious message across. The serious 'hesitate' speech at the end did not make me hesitate to turn off this poor example of comedy. A nearly 5 minute speech on how we should accept everyone.  The voices that she does to represent other characters are extremely annoying. Especially the colonic therapist who is helping her when she goes for internal irrigation. That whole routine sounds like she actually went there and only for the purpose of new material. You just *knew* that some lame joke about touching her other area was coming, and sure enough, she delivered it.   Getting fisted by a lesbian dwarf?  Sorry, but it just was not funny.  The whole scene about visiting an S&M party seems to have been developed just to sound cool. Her method of repeating punch lines is also annoying, it was not funny the first time, why repeat it 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 this is a wonderful value. full of fact filled fun. my 10 yr old grandson has every year. he waits until christmas when he knows he will get the new one. he compares it to the other records from years back. this is a wonderful gift for anyone and is great when also bought with the ripley series. it is fasinating what records people accomplish. c 
 Not well organized, arbitrary, puffed up, dense. If writing well is writing simply and clearly, this writing gets a D. The book is  fraught with tautologies and contradictions not to mention simply not matching reality. It reminds me of the products of academic careerism at their worst 
 I wish someone had warned me -- as I'm about to warn you -- just how lame this movie is.  A low-key, though stylish, story about a mismatched couple whose relationship implodes, this movie finds a tenuous comedic premise in the idea that neither of the ex-lovers is willing to move out of their jointly-owned condominium, and thus are present to torture each other day after day.  She brings home cute guys to make him jealous, he retaliates by throwing sleazy strip-poker parties, and so on.   There are a lot of factors that make this such a lame movie.  In terms of the overall structure, the decision to go straight at the beginning of the movie into the Big Fight that ends their relationship sinks this story right from the start.  We never see them as a happy couple, and never understand why they were attracted to each other, why they were pulled apart, etc.  In short, there's no character development, and no buy-in from the audience -- we just don't care about either of them.  That's a big drawback.  Also, there's no real chemistry between Anniston and Vaughan, and meanwhile the script and pacing are both rather slack... Nothing really clicks here -- the story, the acting, the direction, all blah.  That being said, it wasn't until the very end of the movie that I realized that what the directors were aiming for was a Woody Allen-style character study, a Serious Film.  The first inkling comes when Vaughan delivers his big, serious, take-me-back monologue (which was painful to watch; he was woefully miscast) and the clincher comes in the final scene, where the two ex-lovers meet a year later and have an awkward, um-hi-how-are-you conversation, ala Woody and/or Robert Altman.  In the context of the lifeless film that precedes it, the scene is a dramatic flop (although both actors do reasonably well in the scene itself...) OHHHHHHHH... so THAT'S what they were aiming for!  I get it.  Too bad it didn't work.  Anyway, the short version is: skip this film.  It's a waste of time.  Nice set design, though, and strong cinematography 
 Like most people I got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image.  I've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment.  Sure enough:  * The shutter cover has often stuck open or shut.  * Sometimes it refuses to start at all.  * It sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera.  * Finally, the LCD stopped working altogether.  This is after 8 months.  Casio has decided I'm not under warranty (no explanation as to why, no phone number to argue with them), and is charging me $97 to repair it.  Don't be seduced! It's a poor quality product 
 This Pride and Prejudice fan was hoping for a modern-day movie with a storyline much closer to Pride and Prejudice.  Even Colin Firth could'nt save this one for me!  On its own I found it sadly lacking in just about everything I look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor.   If you are a true Pride and Prejudice fan, I recommend buying the BBC series and the 2005 movie version.  Both are excellent.  I would'nt waste my time again with this one 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 I recently purchased the electronic format hoping I could free up some shelf space because I already own the hardback.  What a disappointment.  I expected links in the Table of Contents but there wasn't even a Table of Contents.    I'd return this if I could.  If it was print, I would.  Two stars only because I liked the print book 
 The key to weight loss is simple, don't eat like a fat big.  The reason people are so very fat is that they stuff themselves silly and then sit down and watch TV.  The best advice: get rid of your TV and eat less.  You won't get that good advice from Dr. Phil, and that is the problem 
 Winter's tale is a series of connected vignettes taking place in Manhattan and upper state New York, spanning more than a century. It is really an ode to a fictionalized version of New York City, from its slums to the homes of its movers and shakers. It is the tale of the search for the perfectly just golden city, that New York is (unbeknownst to most of its inhabitants) striving to become.    Winter's Tale is a maddening book. Helprin is an extremely gifted writer and individual passages are a delight to read. But the story meanders over its 600 pages. There is no coherent plotline. All I can say is that it took me 6 months to wade through it. It is long and it is dull 
 I actually bought this book via reference from '100 ways to motivate yourself'.  The first two thirds are very dry and it taughts about the history of research on learned helplessless.  What I am seeking is 'How to'..which is later part of the book but it was a bit hard to digest 
 I did not finish the book (I got about 70% of the way through before I realized I could not bear to read one more page).  Maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but I doubt it.  This is the first time I can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book.  The characters were flat and plot went nowhere.  Please - there are million of books out there.  Spare yourself, and find something else to read. Anything. 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 a friend of mine recommended this book a while ago and i decided to give it a try. what a waste of time! after a so-so start it dissolves into a silly, improbable, absolutely unbelievable mess, the conclusion being particularly stupid  and unrealistic. if you want to do yourself a favour, stay with patricia highsmith instead 
 Very diappointing for purpose of home decor color inspiration; color quality pale, boring, nothing very interesting.  Not the book for me 
 Around 100 thread count, worst possible quality, not soft, not comfortable. Pattern is ok, but these people think you'd buy a turd if it had a Jedi on it 
 I love to hear old standards and such.  But I like to hear people who put their own take on it.   I can't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra wannabe.  Where are the male versions of Nora Jones?   Tone down the cheese!  We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall.  But what can I expect from the music industry?  Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention.  So, hmmm, nevermind.  I guess it's always been that way 
 It took me 3 years to read this book - should I end the review now? It's not because I am an extremely busy person, or because the book was so enormous that I read it endlessly for that long. No, the reason it took me 3 years to read this book is because it's just not very good. As excellent as Lies My Teacher Told Me was, this was equally bad.  The book is a collection of small essays about various roadside memorials, or statues, or other historical tidbits that adorn the United States landscape. Loewen goes on to expound how incorrect all of them are, in the process suggesting that - now get this - there is racism in this country. Nothing in this book is eye-opening, by a long shot. While some essays do shed some interesting light on our history, the majority of these essays can be summed up by saying that white people have treated black people and Indians poorly. What a surprise. In his next book we may find out that the sun rises in the East.  I'm utterly baffled how anyone can give this book 5 stars. This is a 2 star book which narrowly escapes the fate of a single star only because some of the history here is enlightening, to an extent. The vast majority deals with the deep south and it's predilection towards racism.  In any book which the author doesn't have enough material to sufficiently back his claim, he will resort to such tactics as telling one side of the story or failing to give the full history of the situation. Loewen does both, often times leaving the essay a bare skeleton of what it might have been; leading the attentive reader wondering why things don't seem to add up on the pages of his text.  I feel like the motivating force of this book was to make money, and little else. Perhaps there was a drive to create controversy. But the book is so tame that it can hardly do that. The pages are mostly a chore to get through, as evidenced by the 3 year period it took me to get through it. Truth be told, it may have been sitting on my night stand for 4 years. Either way, I found it dreadfully difficult to pick it up most days.  Entirely not worth it 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 SD110 NOT A GOOD DIGITAL CAMERA. BETTER YET FIND SOMETHING ELSE. I'VE HAD THIS CAMERA ALMOST A YEAR BUT I JUST SELDOM USE IT BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THE PICTURES ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING. IT IS JUST FINE DOWNLOADING THEM ON THE INTERNET BUT WHEN YOU HAVE IT PRINTED ON THE PAPER, THE PICTURES GET BLURRED. NOW,IM LOOKING FOR ANOTHER DIGICAM THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT ME 
 If you're looking for earth-shattering news, this is not the book for you.  While there were a couple of eye openers, most of the information is well known if you've kept up on current events.   Some information is noteworthy.  The fact that people are killed or injured from prescription medication is not news.  Tragic?  Yes, but it's not a secret.  It is something that has been studied and needs to be addressed. Some information is pointless.  Carl Sagan was a pothead?  Why am I not supposed to know that?  More importantly, what's the significance of that?  Drug and alcohol use is hardly a rarity among great thinkers. Some information is questionable.  Someone in the goverment considered biological warfare in Afghanistan?  I'd be surprised if someone didn't at least think of that.  Creativity is not bad in itself, but the execution of the idea may be.  Considering that Rumsfeld and Rice put the kibosh on the idea, I'd say the government acted correctly, and thus, no shocker here.   There are definitely a few winners in here.  Not a great book, but okay to have in the bathroom for some short reads 
 This book did not give the info promised. It does not rate each product. Only gives a review of what something is. I was very disappointed with this book & do not recommend. Go get Baby bargains. It's been my bible! 
 Simply, a terribly written book.  It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style.  His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour.  And that's all.  The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world.   The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of "the soul is love" type crap.  Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place 
 This is misleading...not even 5% of the Ruskin masterwork is printed in this book.  
 Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams 
 LOL! Some people cant be serious these days. The lyrics on every track are straight garbage. So he failed BAD lyric wise. Production wise, some of the beats are pretty good, but a beat doesnt make a song good! Nor does it make horrible lyrics good!! So I think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try J-Kwon, but the game aint for you. I think this album is garbage 
 I read the bad reviews but I bought it, it worked for one week and died. Pure Junk, avaoid anything by Griffin 
 This jacket is so tight that it holds down all the buttons at once and the Creative Zen will not work with it on.  Do not waste your money on this product, you will be very disappointed.  
 I bought this DVD for my third-grade twins who are having difficulty memorizing math facts, and don't quite understand the relation between these math facts and the real world.  I thought this DVD would be perfect, explaining basic math facts with humor and real life examples.  But their explanations are way over the heads of this age group.  In explaining the concept of "carrying over" while adding, for instance, here is what is said and written out on the screen:  "Carrying over means you take the digit in the tensplace of the digit place sum, and carry over that digit to the next digit place to the left in your addition problem.  You do this whenever the sum amount in the digit place is greater than nine."  Yeah, *I* get it, but it is not the simplest way to present it to an elementary grade child.  I'm not certain what grade level this series is for -- perhaps middle school and above? -- but definitely not for those just starting out 
 Other reviewers have noted, quite correctly, this book's divergence from the titular theme.  Without question, this is a book more about the Crusades than the Templars as such.  One reviewer correctly noted that the content addressing the Templars directly is only about 40 pages of the book.  I personally don't object to a book entitled "the Templars" that would be more aptly called "The Templars and their Times" or something of the sort.  My criticism lies more with the factual errors in the book.  Read shows his lack of depth in a variety of ways.  His summaries of relevant sidebar issues (the Assassins, for example) are often both overly simplistic and flawed.  His historical guesswork (the sexual dispositions of Frederick II or Richard the Lionheart) is often slipshod and ignores significant historical facts (like Richard's act of contrition in Sicily).    Finally, maddeningly, he keeps referring to Muslims as Saracens.  True, this is a historical term which was used at the time by many Crusaders.  But, there's no such group of people, and no historian uses it beyond the acknowledgement of a term that was used at the time.  Muslims often called Crusaders "Frengi" (the Franks) though many were of course English, German, Italian, and other nationalities.  It would be just as ridiculous to use this term throughout the book, and equally erroneous.  If you want a good history of the Crusades, and better coverage of the era (including the Knights Templar), I suggest anything by Runciman 
 The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).  The DVD player completely fails to recognize them.  Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....    Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed.  More Taiwanese junk.  (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)  As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...  I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 Guys,  Do not take this sheet piece for GOD sake. I am repenting on it :( please take my advice. Thanks 
 This book is not useful, helpful or inspirational. I received this book as a Christmas gift and was skeptical of it, but decided to give it a chance. Instead of giving me good advice on "getting a life" it gave me literal advice, i.e. how to make your bed, how to take a shower, telling me to make a schedule, etc. I really can't figure out who would need this advice. I was hoping for information on how to feel less like a drooling idiot and feel more connected at the end of a day filled with housework, cooking, Dora the Explorer, frazzled nerves from my 2 year-old and a husband who does't appreciate how hard I work. Instead I wasted the little time I had to myself by reading this simplistic and obvious (yeah I have showering mastered by now) advice.  The authors suggest getting a journal and writing in it and they give you exercises to write about. However the authors never give you any idea about what your writings mean. I guess it's meant to be reflective for each journalist, but I'm still confused as how this is supposed to help me.   I'm pretty sure the authors were stay-at-home-moms who needed some cash so they jumped on the "let's write a book" bandwagon, unfortunately there is really no depth or substance to this book. Save your $15 and buy yourself something - you'll get more satisfaction out of it 
 I read this book because my English Professor spoke highly of it. I would call it a collection of stupid and hypocritical opinions and ideas. So why did your bridge fall down Mr. Engineer? Oh, I dropped my structural steel class so I could do a course in another language. I don't think it's right to criticize something like a college degree if a person doesn't even possess one. Actually I think that something like a college degree would be a great start before writing a book like this. It might decrease the chances of writing a book as stupid as this one. This book insulted my intelligence and I wouldn't even recommend it for a laugh 
 The only thing that I find at all interesting about this book is that so many people take this bad philosophy seriously.  Daly seems to be saying more about her own fears and feelings instead of getting closer to any type  of truth.  She searches, just as the supremacists she so hates did, for the  answers that she wants.  But not to worry dear souls, until such work is  built upon substantial evidence instead of psychofantsy, no one will really  listen or care 
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 I can't believe that Acharya S. thinks that The Christ Conspiracy is the 'Greatest Story Every Sold." as the subtitle to arrogantly claims.   This revisionist materialist seems more bent on reducing spirituality to mere historical factoids which are questionable in themselves in regards to their authenticity.  Unoriginal, unimaginative, The Christ Conspiracy is recommended for insomniacs as it will put you right to sleep 
 This movie is more a curiosity than a "chef d'oeuvre" (French for masterpiece) of erotism. It hasn't aged very well either... It may have been a hit then, because it was one of the first of its kind - although I am not sure.   Coming from my fellow French men, I was expecting a more sensual and passionate love story rather this 2 hours of voyeurism and sadomasochism. I found the movie rather boring, expect maybe for a few scenes. The total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some. 
 It looks like I bought this unit based on the very positive reviews only to come back and see the few less than positive reviews that are brand new. I've had this happen on several products now from Amazon - product has a lot of good reviews, I buy it and by the time I go back to review it there are several non-positve reviews. Makes you wonder if some are being written and scored by people involved with the products. Some of the review sound like sales pitches and brochures and I personally question if these are real consumers -  not that I necesssarily think that happened here.  I bought this unit to and just received in. So, far I am disappointed in it as well, but I'm not ready to throw in the towel with it yet.   The interface takes some getting used to, but I don't find it that horrible compared to others. Some GPS have excellent user interfaces, but most just seem average to below average and the X930 fits in there too. So, I would say its interface is just as bad as most are - there are only a few units with very good interfaces IMO.   The POI in this unit seem ridiculous. Michelin tries/wants/is/offers travel type services in general and I thought this unit would be packed with tons of accurate POIs (Points of Interest) - not really. Maybe I expected too much here but I think their POIs are dismal and very dismal if they are a travel services company. This unit should overflow with POI and again, its just about average. Though I will say again, there are onl a couple of very good GPS unit and then there is all the others, so this unit fits in with all the others IMO.   Its directions are not fabulous so far either.  Any route from my house actually has me drive a circle around my block.  I have not found any route from any point in my city where the "quickest" or "shortest" route is any different and I know of shortcuts.   It also wants to route you to the most major interstate and streets even if a less major put acceptable roadways are closer and shorter. For example, from my house to work it routes me 4 miles west to catch the north-south interstate to get me to the west-east interstate. There is a major road that gets me to the west-east interstate less than a mile to my east though. Shorter distance and quicker drive time.   Same on my work to home route - it routes me 5 miles past two major roadways in order to stay on the interstate - and it does this regardless of choosing "quickest" or "shortest". The interstate may be quickest with no traffic, but it is definately not shortest.   It does attempt to tell you what lane to be in on the interstate but its been the wrong lane for me about 50% of the time - 25% is due to outdated maps, 25% seems just wrong.   I've tried it for some in city driving where I already knew the routes and its routes did get me there, but were not the best or shortest route. I expect a GPS to actually return a shortest route when I ask for it. So far, all the directions I've selected - the shortest route and the quickest route are identical.   I am headed on a several hour drive in a couple of weeks and will see how it goes there.   Like the other reviewers, the speaker is ridiculous - at the out of the box volume level the speaker is distorted and crackly. Its not loud enough with windows open, vents on medium or with a carfull of conversation. Its adequate if you are concentrated on following its directions.   The screen itself is decent. I don't have a big glare issue and the unit responds to my commands ok. The mount is adjustable so glare can be avoided. The unit seems to respond quickly to commands.   I don't think this unit calculates routes or picks up your GPS position extremely quickly. It seems about average there too. I've used some other GPS and I would not say they are much better so maybe my expectation is too high. Again, there's the very high end and then everything else and this fits in with everything else.   Overall, I am disappointed but I may keep the unit because I need a GPS and I don't see one that seems much much better. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I don't think they are.   The MIOs, Garmins, Magellans, etc all have pros/cons and none seem to hit the target completely on price, function, accuracy, interface, etc. They all have their quirks and from playing with several the key items of speed and accuracy don't seem much different. I tried a friends MIO 310x and if I were to review it, my review would sound worse than the Michelin.  I've also used a Garmin 350 and other than perhaps the user interface, my review of it would not sound much different.   So this seems to be par for the course for the $200-$500 GPS - I did not look at higher priced units, because I'm just plain not interested then.  I was really only willing to spend up to $250 on one so my choices were cut down to just 3 units really anyway though I did review some of the $299, $399 and $499 sales units.   Up to $250 your choices are the MIO c310x, Michelin X-930 and a Nextar model. I don't think any one is appreciably better than the other so its a dart-shoot.   If your expectations are high and you need/want a GPS now with the low end price target then all 3 of these are about the same with their own set of quirks. If you don't need/want a GPS now then I would personally wait for the low end units to be improved. They are not worth it (nor do I think the higher priced models are) until they improve.  [...]. 
 I purchased this DVD with my eyes wide open, because I had been forwarned by reviewers I respect, and I still place Dylan's 1977 "Renaldo and Clara" near the top of my most pretentiuos doo doo list. But wait, that was almost 30 years ago and this movie stars Jeff Bridges AND John Goodman (the Dude abides), also Jessica Lange, Giovanni Ribisi, Val Kilmer, Bruce Dern, Mickey Rourke and was co-written and directed by Larry Charles of Seinfeld and Friends fame, so how bad could it be? Well I planned on watching it one night but after about 30 minutes became fatiqued and fell asleep. This went on for about 3 more nights until I finally finished the movie. The week before I had watched the uncut "Heaven's Gate" (nearly 4 hours), a deliberate slowly paced film, in one sitting, and yet "M and A" seemed so much longer. I also skipped watching the few deleted scenes (something I can't remember ever doing), and went straight for the "Making Of" and watched and listened to those involved talking about the great script and a movie I can't remember seeing. I realize now that deleted scenes would be overkill since the entire movie seems like it's just a bunch of strung together deleted scenes. This is not to say the movie is unwatchable, I had kept coming back to it night after night, in fact there are some very entertaining and surreal moments in the film, I just wish there had been more of them. For starters I would have liked to have seen more of Ribisi, for he was the most focused in his part (though it also seemed like he was in another movie), they could have beefed up the Christian Slater-Chris Penn bits or even made them the main characters and created a sort of Abbott and Costello Meet Jack Fate. Val Kilmer was great, but he disappeared too soon, and some of the songs Dylan did with his band were pretty good, but they could have given the young girl (Tinashe Kachingwe), who stole the show singing "The Times They Are A-Changin'", more of Dylan's songs to sing.  The best part of the film for me was Jeff Bridges as a Dudesque reporter asking Dylan's Jack Fate lots of bizarre questions, in fact a short that just edited together all these bits would be enjoyable. I guess that's most of the good stuff, but on the other hand, I wish they had removed the entire subplot concerning his dying father (Richard Sarafian) Angela Bassett, and Mickey Rourke, and despite old man makeup, his father still looks younger than Bob (things must have been pretty bad in prison).  Less of Lange and Goodman would have made it less irratating, and Luke Wilson and particularly Penelope Cruz should have ended up on the cuttingroom floor. I'm not sure what to make of Ed Harris in black-face except that I felt like he was a refugee from some old Fellini film. Bob Dylan acts like he sings which isn't so bad in a film where  many of the other actors are so over-the-top, and watching him is like looking at an abstract painting, it doesn't ever change but you keep looking at it to try and find some inner meaning. This is Larry Charles first film and judging by his TV work you would have expected it to be at least funny, but where "Seinfeld" was supposed to be a TV show about nothing but was actually about alot, this movie really is about nothing 
 I would NOT recommend this book to any electrician, engineer, or architect.  It is extremely difficult to comprehend.  Gaining any practical information from this book is futile.   I have had the twelfth edition over ten years.   I used it to study for the electricians exam.  I hated it then.  Since that time, I have found it to be a very poor reference book.   The thirteenth edition is no better.  I understand why some electrician training schools might use this book - it is very comprehensive.   It would make a good reference for a classroom lesson plan, but not a direct teaching tool.  If you want to learn the material in this book, get the National Electric Code Handbook (and related materials published by the NFPA) and appropriate textbooks.   FYI - I am a licensed electrician and a registered professional engineer 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 I suffered through three-quarters of this book then took it back to the libary without bothering to finish it. i simply DID NOT CARE about the story or characters.  I told myself if the author wrote, "dear bookbuyer" one more time within the book, I'd throw the book into a river (which I couldn't do since it wasn't my book, but would have loved to!) I was really surprised at how horrible this book was since i figured the author of Schindler's List (which I haven't yet read) would know how to write 
 Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music "self-indulgent bullsh**" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's "Fair and Balanced" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there 
 I wish I had read further in the reviews, if I had known that the song 'I Love The Nite Life' had been replaced I would never have bought the film. It is very limp without this...shame, shame, shame! This should be mentioned so that folks can make a more informed decision, instead of wasting money 
 THE DAY I GOT IT I WAS SO EXCITED TO MOUNT THIS AND START USING IT. ATTACHING THE ITEM WAS VERY EASY TO DO IF YOU CAN READ, WHICH I WAS IN LUCK THERE, SO I GOT THAT DONE. AS SOON AS I USED IT, IT WASN'T WORKING CORRECTLY TO START WITH. I OPENED THE SLOT TO PUT THE CD INTO IT, AND THE CD TRAY WOULDN'T CLOSE. I HAD TO TURN THE POWER OFF AND THEN BACK ON TO GET THE TRAY TO GO BACK INTO THE UNIT. BY THIS TIME IT WAS EASIER TO JUST DO THAT THEN TO REMOVE THE UNIT AND SEND IT BACK; SO TO THIS DAY I HAVE IT IN THE KITCHEN BUT BETWEEN THE CD TRAY AND THE POOR SOUND QUALITY I DONT USE IT AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT I WOULD 
 Badly organized book.  Repetitive text and graphs.  Stretching theories.  Bad analogies.  Hardly provide any useful framework can be used in real life.  Like the auther is sitting in a small dark room and murmuring to himself 
 Despite the fact that this item is described as a "set", and the picture shows stones on the board, this board comes with no stones.  When my board arrived, the top of the board had rubbed against the cardboard box enough to partially wear away the grid on the board, at least to the point where the item is unsuitable as a gift 
 This little book sounded like just what I could use in running a group of "Primetimers" at church...having socials I mean.  It is not very cleverly written.....and I will probably get rid of it 
 I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   Concerned in Alabam 
 This book leaves alot to be desired. It seems like the author might have been asked to write a book on gemstones and went out to gather a jumble of metaphysical information together and then added gemstone correspondences to them. My advice, stay away and buy something more credible 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 What kind of an experiment was this cable watching thing supposed to be? The guy goes on a hike and imagines he comes back full of some eternal "wisdom" and then sits down and watches TV for 1700 hours straight, and comes to the conclusion that the 1700 hours of TV watching were not particularly rewarding...! give me a break! well duh-of course watching tv for a month straight isnt rewarding! Its amazing that people sit down and write big books making these sorts of obvious points. In the end mcKibben succeeds in shining a damning light on our culture - not through his "experiment" but by publishing the book. A culture, where people can pretend to be clever intellectuals by making the kind of social experiments and delvering the kind of half baked "insights" as McKibben does, is in serious, serious trouble 
 Wusthof is high quality stuff, but there is no lifetime guarantee and the handles aren't dishwasher safe.  If I was going to chose a set, Cutco knives are by far the best knives in quality and price.  They also have a comprehensive lifetime guarantee that makes that 10 times better than this large wusthof set 
 I just recently got the 1999 HBO Home Video/Deluxe version, and I cannot stand to watch about a third of the movie.  Starting with the "Blue Shadows" song and running through to the scenes in El Guapo's villa where Ned has his shootout with the German pilot, the film rocks back and forth across the screen!  I tried it on two different DVD players, and the lateral movement is nauseating.  It seems like somebody hit the camera while filming this off of a screen to DVD, and to top it off the final credits are cut off about midway through.  I hope to find a better version so I can watch this great movie again without the experience destroying wobble 
 This was a very thin book for the price. I didn't get a lot out of it. I love spiritual books but this one was not very informative and each page there was just a lot of repition. I got bored with it 
 Though some people might find this book to be exciting and sexy and intriguing, please don't consider it as truth. This book should have been labelled as Fictional, which is what it is. Sally should have interviewed people who really knew the details- maybe spoken to members of the families involved, instead of spouting lies and touting them as truths. As a member of one of the families in the book, I know what I am talking about, and it hurts me deeply the lies that were told, which I can verify, matter of factly, were false.   
 I am an academic economist who frequently collaborates with scientists and find that interdisciplinary collaboration is often fruitful and that there are clear synergies from letting scholars from different fields interact. I therefore purchased this book with the expectation of being exposed to useful ideas. I was sadly disappointed. The book starts with stating the need for behavioral physics. I smiled a little at this, since economists have been doing this for 150 years, but I guessed that you can't know everything. Then the author started writing about economics. Oh boy! Either the author is truly ignorant of economic research the last 50 years or this guy is to scientific writing what Ann Coulter is to punditry. I doubt that there is a single economic concept that the author has understood. A fundamental concept such as Pareto optimality is botched. Apparently there is evidence that prices fall when demand grows which would be news to most economists (including Adam Smith who is supposed to have expressed this interesting idea.) The author states that economists look for theories that enables prediction of market movements whereas real traders know that this is not possible. Any economist will tell you that the truth is the other way around. In fact, economists know that unless there is asymmetric information among traders it is not possible to consistently outperform the market. Real traders make a living trying to do so. And the statement that microeconomic models ignore interactions between agents is just laughable. In fact economics is a holistic science in the sense that it is explicitly acknowledged that actions are interconnected. This is what general equilibrium analysis is all about. (I don't recall the publication date of Cournot's market model but it was a long time ago.) I could come up with more examples of nonsense but if you want a laugh, just borrow the book at the library. I am concerned with the disingenousness of the writing style. There is no end to the number of statements like "Some economists believe," "mosts economists will" and "many think that." Since I don't recognize any of this I can only assume that he made these things up. The other approach is to cherry pick bad ideas from the past and present them as current practice. (Kontradieff cycles!!!)   In my interactions with scientists I have often despired about the calvalier attitude they have to economics. They seem to think that having a Ph.D. in e.g. physics means that they are super-smart (which they often are) so something as trivial as economics must be dead simple to them. This leads them to say the dumbest things like claiming that energy should be the unit of account when measuring value. It seems to me that having a brain that understands quantum mechanics and relativity makes you supremely unable to understand elemenetary aspect of behavioral science. (Although you may be able to predict behaviour in queues and other not very interesting patterns.) The contrast with biology is interesting. The flow of useful ideas between biologists and economists has been very beneficial to both sciences and promise to be more so in the future. 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 I think I must have got a bad batch because this polish is highly rated.  It never dried to a haze for me.  The first time i used it I thought I hadn't shaken the bottle enough.  The second time I shook the bottle - seven days later it still hasn't dried enough to buff off.  I'm not sure if its the product or whether Amazon are selling an inferior conterfeit 
 Dull, antiseptic, lacking any interesting perspective. At best, you could say this book is like a series of colorless newspaper articles strung together, at worst, a book written by someone so far removed from his subject that he might as well of been writing about extraterrestials.   I wonder if Raab has ever actually met or talked to a mafiosi face to face. This book seems to get all its information from law enforcement souces, prosecutorial types, or other books. Nowhere is there any kind of sociological context that might raise the subject matter above the level of journalism -- and flat, lifeless journailism at that.  For someone so accomplished and genearlly recongnized as an "expert" in his field, this book is a big snooze 
 	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.  	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations. 	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.  	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.  	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away. 
 Nrretranders is not a scientist or researcher, but rather a science journalist.  That isn't necessarliy a bad thing in itself, but his book clearly suffers for his lack of scientific training, and the rigour it would have introduced.  User Illusion reads like a series of breezy, vastly oversimplified pop-sci articles.  His concepts - ranging from info theory to thermodynamics, are strung together with the loosest of connections.  For example, he compares the information intake of our senses with that processed by our consciousness in terms of bits.  But, he clearly has no formal definition of a bit in mind, using it to refer to anything from an actual binary bit, all the way up to an entire piece of music.  This makes it impossible to take his comparison seriously.  Consciousness itself is never even formally defined.  His treatment near the end of the earth's energy intake, and even dirty diapers, in terms of information theory is laughable.  The only useful take-away here is the reminder that there is a lot more going on inside our heads than we are consciously aware of.  A useful reminder, but that should not be news to anyone.  User Illusion also makes a good index of current (in 1991) 'sexy' science topics such as complexity 
 i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective-like game.  unfortunately, this game is very kid-like.  here's an example.  the first non auto-generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy.  these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children's word game book.  i easily got all of them except 1, meaning i couldn't progress past this point.  no problem for me, because by this time i didn't want to!  i'm not saying it's a bad game, it's just probably not a good game for grownups. 
 I bought this book after seeing Gary Null speaking on a PBS TV program. I was so impressed with his knowledge and the hope he offered in the anti-aging remedies he discussed and other valuable information he was offering in this book. I just couldn't wait to read it.  Unfortunately, after I purchased this book, I was very disappointed.  My strongest impression about the book was the very disorganized way it was prepared. There is a serious lack of appropriate catagorization and sequential arrangement of subject matter, topics, etc. It was hard for me to believe that Gary Null had anything to do with the preparation of the book.  I thought he had just mistakenly designated an unprofessional, inexperienced person to take on that responsibility for him.  After approximately 3 years, I'm still trying to understand his anti-aging program/s and the approach of implementing them. Its hard to make sense of a bunch of information randomly thrown together. Since then I have found  valuable books with practicle approaches for emplementing the anti-aging programs in them.  I recommend The Perricone Prescription, and The Wrinkle Cure by Nicholas Perricone M.D..  He has recently published additional anti-aging books, as well 
 This book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the Dot Com Boom was at its zenith, shortly before the crash. Interestingly, there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon.  Lewis' "Liar's Poker" was extremely enjoyable, particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players. In this book, Lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character. The tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to Clark's disciples as the "smartest," "best," "greatest," and "most ingenious," individuals in their various fields.  What strains credibility, however, is the attribution of all Clark's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight, while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and short-sighted beliefs of others. History will probably not judge Clark as charitably as Lewis -- especially since most of the Clark's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their Dot Com era glory (most notably SGI, Netscape, and Healtheon).  Throughout the book, Jim Clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between $3 and $4 billion. The list of 2004 Forbes 400 Richest in America shows Jim Clark with an approximated net worth of $700 million. For a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of Oracle's Larry Ellison, today Clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation: billionaire.  
 do  not buy this i got a large and feels like a smal 
 Unlike most AP review books, this one fails to include what I'd call "American History in 150 pages." The content review is extremely minimal and extremely difficult to navigate. Anyone who sells this book would also sell Kaplan or Princeton Review. Definitely better choices. 
 If you are looking to obtain a basic knowlege of web programming, then this is not the book for you. I wanted a basic guide, but the author managed to create a book that is TOO basic. Yes, I was able to get my first website up on the internet, but it doesn't DO anything. For that, I'll need to buy another book. 
 Worth getting for the Bowie cover (Rebel Rebel)but a Rollers Hits collection without Bye Bye Baby is pretty silly. The covers of I Only Want To Be With You and Be My Baby are somewhere between pointless and horrid 
 The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these 
 I felt that the authors writing style was about that of a middle school student.  Unfortunately, there are few books on the life of Lady Bird, and I did learn quite a bit about her life.  I was disappointed that once LBJ's presidency was over, the book ended in a few short chapters.  The author flew through the last 30+ years!  I find it hard to believe that Lady Birds life didn't include much that could have been included in the book.  Also, one of the women I admire most in American history is Congresswoman Barbara Jordan of Texas, who was a close friend of LBJ's.  There is a photograph of Ms. Jordan with Lady Bird included in this book and the author did not even mention her in the caption that accompanies it.  Tacky! 
 All throughtout this book Alex Delaware and his police friend Milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover.  They have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture.  The reader longs for the pair to actually do something.  In the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings.  That is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking.  I read and enjoyed several of the early Alex Delaware books and then quit looking for new ones, now I know why 
 I was excited about reading this book because the cover and table of contents looked so interesting. However, upon reading it, I'm not sure exactly what it was about. It was boring, disorganized, and the author's overwhelming sense of snobbery was quite a turnoff! (Not to mention the blurbs on nearly every page singing her praises. Weird.) If you can check it our from the library, it's a quick read, but don't waste your money 
 The recipes and wine suggestions are all right, but the plot is improbable, and the characters are badly drawn.  People fall in love for no particular reson and murder one another for even fewer reasons.  It took me forever to wade through it even though it is a short easy read 
 I have been drinking green tea for years, and love not only the taste but the smell too.  When I opened up the box of this tea I thought I was standing over an old ash tray!  It's smells horrid and doesn't infuse well into the water.  I steeped a table spoon of it for five minutes and the water color barely changed.  I highly recommend you NOT buy this tea.  Exotic product aside, the plain old Lipton green tea bags from the grocery store are far better 
 What made Wall Street Meat entertaining were the personal anecdotes regarding his contact with various well known personalities.  This book starts in a similar vein, with stories about his efforts to raise money for his hedge fund.  Then the book seems to completely lose its focus.  It turns first into a high level history of the industrial revolution in England, and then into an economics lesson.  The history is circumstantial and of questionable relevance.  The economics is pure poorly thought out drivel.  This stuff goes on for chapter after chapter.  Had I written a review after the first few chapters, I would have given the book four stars.  After finishing the book, I think I'm being generous giving it two stars 
 This was a critically lauded film, so when I went in, I had high expectations.  Roger Ebert himself called it a masterpiece.  I saw it, and it was certainly interesting, but I immediately forgot about it right after I left the theater.  There really isn't much depth here.  It's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something, then after it wears off, you don't even remember how you felt afterwards.  I remember a scene where a cow is blown up, but other than that, it's hard for me to remember anything about it.  It ultimately was very ordinary, and not a really deep film about war.  
 You can find all the information (and more) this book provides on the internet. So if you have a little time to search the web, you don't need this book.  And it doesn't answer all the questions you may have. You still need the help of a lactation consultant or your baby's doctor. So if you have more problems than mastitis and engorgement, this book won't help you 
 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 I received the wrong item.  It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my little girl and I had to hurry and find this item at another store.  The company still has not sent me a call ticket for UPS to come and pick it up so I can receive a refund after many emails.  I will not be purchasing from this company ever again 
 Th French Diet is an enjoyable read and does contain a few molecules of truth. Unfortunately, the French Diet is misleading in that it does not tell the whole story of why the French people have lower rates of heart disease, and are less overweight and obese than Americans. The book is "politically correct" in that the author does not explain that, for the most part, the French reject the lipid hypothesis, which is the belief that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease. Montignac over-emphasizes the role of olive oil in the French diet. Although the French do consume (and produce) large quantities of olive oil, they also consume large quantities of butter, cream, full-fat yogurt, raw-milk cheese, and duck fat. These foods are all high in saturated fat, contradicting the authors claim that the French consume primarily monounsaturated fats. The author also neglects to mention the ugly fact that the French smoke more than Americans and the potential impact this has on caloric intake.  
 Tepid entry in the collection. Lorre's Moto a bit of a bore 
 I found Mitchell's topic very interesting and approached the books with a lot of enthusiasm.  However, in the end I found Mitchell's description disappointing.  While he does note a few concrete changes he expects to come about in the urban landscape (e.g. buildings being less clearly distinguished in terms of the kinds of activities they contain, and perhaps a shift in the importance of the urban center as digital connectivity diminishes the emphasis on physical location) that were good starting points for a consideration of architecture in the digital age, the bulk of this book was characterized by repetitive speculation about the changes associated with the digital age (accounts that may have made more of an impact on his readers in 1995 when the book was first published, but today seem rather obvious or exagerated and tiresome to read) without really relating them to architecture in an insightful way.  Mitchell's vague and speculative language distracted me from the few interesting points that he did make. Interesting topic, but Mitchell's treatment of it was not particularly satisfying.  
 The messages in this book cannot be faulted: treat your child with respect and teach self control. The prequel, "Raising Your Spirited Child", teaches parents to first adjust to their child's temperament and is quite good. Much of content is repeated in this book. The disadvantage of this book is that the messages get lost in the overly abundant stories used to humanize and illustrate behavioral points. And all have simple causes and neat conclusions. Reading was slow and not particularly beneficial. For a parenting book that better addresses common problems, common responses and better responses, read "How to Talk to Your Child". However, there's still the need for a book that addresses how to handle situations where time doesn't allow diplomacy or diplomacy doesn't yield results 
 After quite a while I finally put the time into reading this book and I am totally ambivalent whether I should have or not...I do not think that one should pay too much attention to those readers who do not take their history seriously, to those that want to propound a certain ideological agenda -- something I am realising has been,and is, a depressing fact of American socialisation. Those people of the ideological left will love this book and the those of the ideological right will hate it.... that is a given.   My question is this: What does Zinn have to say for the non-ideological historian? For the thinking and well considered historian, the person who well distilled in classic debates of history and the role of people, power and groups (classes?) in the grand scheme of things? What does Zinn have to say for those who were raised with a university education where the primary goal was to "display an adequate overview of all major acceptable views, and to show a mature understanding of those views?" -- not to argue just one side. American historiography has a broad tendency to degenerate into opposite truth camps of the right and left, mindlessly shouting out statistics, citing dates, supporting and dashing administrations to try to make a point. The entire pursuit of knowledge has been subverted by a kind of default to crude rhetoric for rhetoric's sake (see any American news programme or most prime-time columnists), and purile debate. Other countries and cultures shake their heads at such perversion of the whole idea of the way Americans understand history.    So do historians such as Zinn add to this atrophy of the brain or do they ammeliorate it? I am not so sure I know the answer. I am thinking that his whole style may betray an answer. Zinn's "radical" style is deliberately unbalanced, he makes no apologies for this, it is an attempt to right the largely unbalanced scales of history written by dominant elites, those who have and hold the power. This is a worthy ideal, but I am not so sure that a descriptive litany of abuse by those with power really says that much about an accurate interpretation of history. And if it does not, then what are people actually taking away from this book...?  Anyone who reads history, and I mean people who read a lot of history, will find Zinn to be more than just unbalanced, they will find him to be simplistic. I was caught up in his light drama (he writes well), in the same way as one reads a comic book... and then it dawned upon me... Zinn (like a left-wing version of Fox News reporting) writes as if history were a comic book. All evil on one side and all deprived and down trodden masses on by the other. For the considerate person looking for a higher understanding there will be an amazing sense of dissatisfaction, a feeling of being swindled. If one is trying to achieve social justice, there is a feeling of being swindled.   That may not be flattering for Mr. Zinn, but I got the distinct feeling that one was dealing with a light-weight in the area of history (some of his research is hard to check, he does not cite pages, and I sometimes wonder if he ever cracked an economic history textbook). He certainly would not be considered up there with the grand old man Hobsbawm (who is truly an intellectual joy to read -- and a leftist with common sense!!), or Lukas(another leftist) in his great tour-de-force "Big Trouble: A Study of Class in America." Zinn does not even rate compared with these historians.   So the question I return to is this.... for the considerate person of history, what does one get from this read? My conclusion is that besides some interesting vignettes on American inhumanity to man, or American inhumanity to American -- not much...Even if American history is imbalanced because the "majority" or mainstream history does not pay heed to the downtrodden, meeting diatribe with diatribe is neither a worthy nor reasonable approach -- moreover it is intellectually dishonest. Being biased, for whatever reason, is not something that historians, scientists, or social theoritst should TRY to be...   Historians must try to grasp a modicum of understanding through the haze of sources and alternative viewpoints. They must neither be hoodwinked by the codswallop of postmodernism or the absolute truth "certainty" of various right-wing historians. That is the challenge for the historian -- indeed it is the challenge for any thinking human being. If one wants to write comics that is a worthy endevour -- it is not however history. For a man of his age, he should know better!  *If you are thinking of reading this I would say that his writing style and capturing the drama is rather good, despite the fact that his sources (from the little I was able to check) are horrible.  
 I just got this edition from Amazon a couple of weeks ago. For starters, I've been looking up favorite movies that I know extremely well. It seems like every 3rd or 4th review in this guide flat-out gives away either the film's ending or a crucial plot twist! Very strange, and completely bogus IMO. It leaves me confused and disgruntled.   I thought I understood the English national character pretty well, but what's up with these London reviewers? Do their British readers really tolerate, much less appreciate, having the thrill of mystery and discovery just stolen away?   As we all know, here in the US it's taboo to ruin the narrative surprise in any kind of review, unless one explicitly puts a "warning-- spoilers below!" comment in first. Obviously, I support this taboo, and for whatever reason, the Time Out film guide editors have decided to flout it. Their bizarre lack of sympathy for the reader's feelings is simply inappropriate IMO for a film guide, so I rate this work only 2 stars 
 In today's pace driven world, I was looking forward to a little respite in James Ogilvy's book.  Unfortunetely, it didn't deliver for me.  What  suggests to be a guide to finding creativity and fulfillment, ends up being  nothing more than the author's sterile philosophical rantings.  Actually, I  don't know how it ended since I only made it through half the book.  I  would have liked less history and more "evidence" or anecdotes  from the author's life that promote this way of living.  Ogilvy wants to  sell us on "goallessness", but doesn't offer any kind of  convincing argument.  Too bad, since I would tend to agree with this point  of view! 
 I've never seen another book that gets mostly just 1-star or 5-star ratings. That's how it manages the 3-star average. Don't bother reading the reviews. They depend only the political views of the writer, and not really on the book at all.  However, it's worth noting that by far most of the bad grammar and spelling in the reviews are from the voters who gave the book 5 stars. I can't imagine that that has ever happened with another book 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 Judging by the introduction to this book it is hard to believe that Rick Steves has actually set foot in Portugal during the last 20 years let alone 2005. The statement right at the start of the Intro, that the "roads are rutted" is a ludicrous. I have been travelling regularly to Portugal since 1965 and can guarantee that the main (toll) roads in Portugal are now some of the best highways in the world. They are certainly better engineered and constructed than any of the highways in the US Interstate system. The secondary roads are also generally well maintained although crowded at times. This one totally outdated piece of information alone casts doubt on the validity of the rest of the information in the book. I would recommend looking elsewhere fo more accurate information 
 iF i COULD, i WOULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS.Caveat emptor! Let the buyer beware. I made the horrible and expensive mistake of buying this the beginning of Feb. 2007. I had to open the box to realize I needed to load it as administrator. That was beyond my limited knowledge. Since it was opened I stupidly believed in their money back guarantee and got a return authorization. It took forever and many calls. They kept on lying on when the refund was mailed. Yes, this went into April 2007!!!!! They insisted the mailing date was April 9th. On the 18th I thought I'd never get it. They stopped payment and maybe issued another. Well, I received the $199 (I am shafted on my state sales tax.) But because those idiots didn't put the name of my street, it apprently was returned and what I got was postmarked April 16th!!!!! And they refuse to rescind the stoppayment. Sooooo...I now need to pray I will ever receive the replacement. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I can't beleive these people sell accounting and contact software 
 Anyone hoping to gain an objective insight into the complex tragedy of the GLF should avoid this book at all costs.  Despite the author's reputation as a noted scholar in the field, he makes sweeping, generalized claims that  are simply not documented.  In discussing the negative aspects of the GLF,  for example, all efforts are made to present Mao as not  responsible--somehow separated from the policy-making process and therefore  not responsible for the terrible consequences.  The millions of deaths that  resulted are acknowledged, but the author quickly points out that Mao did  inspire millions of workers in China to work for the common good, as if  this somehow compensated for the maniacal toll on the country.  I don't  know why Mr. Macfarquhar is such an apologist for Mao, but it clearly  interferes with the balance of his analysis and would outrage any sensible  student of Chinese history 
  I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY!   This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up.  Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something.  Thumbs DOWN. 
 I was disappointed by this book. I thought the book would be about BIG, but the book focused on people who really didn't have anything to do with him. The book doesn't focus on Christopher Wallace, instead it tells more about Tupac, Orlando Anderson, and other unimportant people. A lot of things are mentioned six times in the book. There are few new details. What I would have liked was more about his childhood, as Voletta Wallace is a source that shouldn't have been a problem.  What exactly happened that night? Some people are keeping their mouth shut and that is a real shame.  BIG is still the greatest, he should have gotten more respect than this, not only from Cathy Scott, but also from his "friends" 
 Hi  I bought this heater at Home Depot and was very happy initially. It did an awesome job at heating my garage. It would heat up my 2 car garage from high 50s to high 60s in a couple of hours. But, I needed something that could work in the garage for 3 to 4 hrs everyday. A month after we bought it, it broke down....it would not start up...  Awful - not durable at all. 
 As a professional photographer, I think the organization that publishers this magazine has truly lost their way.  The images are predictable and unimaginative and haven't changed in the past 25 years.  There are much better magazines to read 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 I found this book to be a disappointing read. The writing was simple and lacking descriptions that had depth.  Half way through I just put the book down, which wasn't terrible far along, because there was a lot of dead white space between the large font type. I couldn't help but think this book was written by someone cashing in on their Amish ancestors, that they, in this case Louise Stoltzfus, doesn't understand.   Good Books has some outstanding books available, I am not sure why they bothered to publish this one 
 bestseller -Stupid plot -horrible plot -dumb characters  I have one conculsion Matthew reilly was trying to buy up all the copies of this book to save himself from embrassmen 
 Julia Child was a lovely person with an interesting life but this book as written is unreadable. Poor sentence structure and continual,unecessary use of parenthesis. Try My Life in France. Much better 
 Nrretranders is not a scientist or researcher, but rather a science journalist.  That isn't necessarliy a bad thing in itself, but his book clearly suffers for his lack of scientific training, and the rigour it would have introduced.  User Illusion reads like a series of breezy, vastly oversimplified pop-sci articles.  His concepts - ranging from info theory to thermodynamics, are strung together with the loosest of connections.  For example, he compares the information intake of our senses with that processed by our consciousness in terms of bits.  But, he clearly has no formal definition of a bit in mind, using it to refer to anything from an actual binary bit, all the way up to an entire piece of music.  This makes it impossible to take his comparison seriously.  Consciousness itself is never even formally defined.  His treatment near the end of the earth's energy intake, and even dirty diapers, in terms of information theory is laughable.  The only useful take-away here is the reminder that there is a lot more going on inside our heads than we are consciously aware of.  A useful reminder, but that should not be news to anyone.  User Illusion also makes a good index of current (in 1991) 'sexy' science topics such as complexity 
 Save your money!  This is the worst computer add-on I have ever purchased.  Not only did the product not work as described, the software and documentation were absolutely pathetic. The software does not come packaged with the device drivers, you have to download and install it from the company's horrible website (If your still tempted to buy, check their wesite first).  I returned the device to Amazon and thankfully got a refund.  Amazon needs to include a Zero Star option 
 Pros: -Exercises are well described and illustrated with caveats to avoid and variations. -A well organized plan for exercising.  Cons: -Lots of editing mistakes -Using almost the same exercises over and over seems boring and counter productive -The book recommends you to limit your exercies to one hour yet the workout routines at a minimum contains 14 exercises of 2 sets each even for the beginner. With one minute rest between each exercise and one minute for performing the exercise and moving/changing plates/waiting for the rack to empty/etc at the very minimum that's already an hour (especially that exercises are superset so you will be doing a lot of moving around). Add warmup set to that and you've got a lot more than you anticipated. -Selection of exercises do not mention which exercises targets which muscles (i.e. only chest/back/shoulders). I would prefer mentioning what parts of the delts or which part of the chest. -Follows from the previous point also the author says "You can replace with another exercise .." but doesn't tell you which exercise can be replaced with which. We know that not all chest exercise are created equal. Not enough information on that. -No mention of warmup. For example in the breakin routine which is supposedly for beginners, the book specifies 2 sets of 10 for most exercises. Now I can't imagine going straight ahead to the gym doing 2 sets of each exercise with a heavy weight that only allows 10 reps. Definitely that's the shortest way to injury and soreness. Also as you do the first set of 10 without prior warmup , the second set will be easier and you can increase the weight. So is that the goal? just doing 10 reps of whatever you can? not enough on that. -No mention of stretches prior or after workout. And given that warmup is not mentioned either, it seems it was just neglected rather than being intentionally designed out of the program. -The book website forums are almost ignored, no questions answered any recently, and sending email to the author doesn't seem to make any replies back 
 Plan of attack in releasing anger according to to this CD is by imaging your in a room with the person responsible and letting your anger go at them - didn't work with me only made things worse 
 A triumph of crass commercial misinformation and hyperbolic dilettantism over actual learning. Bragg and his handlers, in their rush to make a quick buck, seem barely to have skimmed a few shady amateur websites for their facts. Those readers with any education will find their eyebrows rising with incredulity to read that the Indo-European languages stem originally from India; that English is a rarity among languages for not being controlled by a French-style scholarly academy; that Shakespeare, apparently in need of even more credit, invented no fewer than 2,000 new English words; and that Bede apparently had a time machine, since his quotation of the then 300-year-old letter to Aetius is related as if Bede were the author. Beyond the unblinking confusion over basic facts, the story-telling style ham-handedly anthropomorphizes English itself, alternately "wanting all the space it could claim" or growing "confident enough to take on newcomers", as a "battle-hardened" hero with mysteriously unique qualities, smacking of manifest destiny, that could only be perceived by an author who has never read the history of any other language or heard of the concept of sampling bias. For example, English is characterized as having an almost superhumanly unique "capacity to absorb other" languages, in a breathless description requiring the support of no fewer than three sinister adjectives - "cunning", "subtle", and "ruthless" - just in one sentence. Telling, then, that the guileless five-star reviewers' praise emphasizes such qualities as "easy to read". The less undiscerning will balk at hunting out the residue of actual knowledge from among Bragg's galloping storytelling, unless as a parlor game, and will find far more profit with any of a large number of excellent, slightly less easy alternatives. And by the way, the English translations from Frisian omit entire clauses 
 When I got half way through this novel I asked myself: "Why am I reading this?" It's isn't very interesting. For the first time I can recall I fell asleep midday while reading this book.If a good editor had slashed the manuscript by 50% it might be more readable. My recommendation: Give it a pass 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 I wouldn't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that I had to when I saw what Christiane Schmidt had to say. Now we all know Mr Gibson has got issues with the British (as well as others) - just look at that other pile of tosh - Braveheart. But here is an example of why rewriting history to fit your own personal prejudice is dangerous. The usual response is "It's not history but Hollywood, it's fiction based on historical events". But the problem is that some people actually believe it really happened like that! Now I'm sure that many atrocities took place on either side of what was in effect a civil war, but I've never read of the British burning down churches with people inside - Nazis, yes....British, no. But who cares about whether it really happened....it's only a film!! Good grief, next thing you know they'll be making a film about the US recovering the first enigma machine.....oops. 
 Did you travel around the world to pay high prices to hang out with a bunch of ill mannered tourists?  If so, the Lonely Planet is for you.  If not, throw the LP in the garbage 
 I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility.  Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow.  Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case.   The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development.   The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks.  The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs.  At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as,        "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way.   This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries.  
 I was very excited to read this book after finishing Duane Schultz excellent book about the damage control on USS Houston, where Santa Fe played an important role, but by page 15 I had counted 4 serious errors or editing mistakes, most notably that USS Saratoga was at the Battle of Midway.  I couldn't plow on because I couldn't trust the information that I didn't know given that the stuff that I did was riddled with mistakes 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 Me, my husband and my daugther all HATED this CD.  The artist line-up seemed so good, but the very creepy & morose first track, "Pure Imagination" only led to further disappointments as the CD progressed.  The only track worth listening to was the "Rainbow Connection" by the Dixie Chicks, but it really wasn't worth skipping through all of the other heavy and uninspired tracks.  I wasted my money on this one 
 This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed 
 This boys' adventure, republished by Tor in a hardbound edition, was published in 1948 and was one of Robert Heinlein's first books. Set several hundred years into the future, the solar system has been colonized on one of Jupiter's moons and on Venus, where beneath the clouds the air is breathable and intelligent life was discovered. Keeping the peace is the Solar Patrol, whose atomic bombs circle the earth while its members continue exploring the planets, moons and asteroids.  "Space Cadet" follows the journey of Matthew Brooks of Des Moines, Iowa, and his friends Tex, Oscar and Pierre (from Texas, Venus and Jupiter's moon), through their education at the Space Academy, finishing up with an adventure when their ship runs into trouble during a mission to Venus. Heinlein spends the first hundred pages moving them through this world — the patrol bears significant resemblance to the U.S. Navy — then puts them onboard a ship for about the next 50 pages before bringing in a story.   There are a couple sections that shows themes Heinlein will explore in future novels. There's the wide gulf between the civilian and military worlds, that Matt discovers when he tries to explain how the atomic bombs circling the earth — ready to be dropped down the gravity well on any city that gets uppity — are maintained. This leads to some bizarre lines such as "Now, Catherine, you can't imagine Matt bombing Des Moines, now can you? And that is what it amounts to. Tell her, Matt."  So far adult readers, "Space Cadet" brings with it the charm of "Golden Age" science-fiction: the finned rockets, the elite space organization and a few aliens thrown into the mix. Heinlein nails portable phones, but computers are room-sized and rockets land on their tail. In his perfectly run Solar Patrol, he includes officers from all races (even a black officer is mentioned, but not seen), and yet the patrol is firmly phallocentric.  As for children, "Space Cadet" is pretty bland stuff. To children brought up on Harry Potter, video games and anime, "Space Cadet" is more likely to induce eye-rolling than a sense of wonder 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I think I was a little mislead by this book. At first, I thought it was going to contain funny material like George Carlin's Brain Droppings. But instead it was more about Cedric's life. And to be honest, I didn't find it all that funny. I stopped reading it after the first 20 pages. Hard core fans of Cedric will like this, but others might not. I thought Drew Carey's bio was much funnier 
 This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason. 
  I was forced to read Abel's Island for a school assingment. It was about this mouse on and island. Very boring.... It was miserable to have to read this, so do not waste your time reading it! 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 After reading five of her novels, I have become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I will admit (and this probably proves that I am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself) that I've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that didn't make it on the list.   Initially I liked the book and it kept me reading, though maybe just out of habit. I enjoyed reading about the Amish way of life and the Amish traditions - though it did make me think of that Harrison Ford movie, Witness (circa 1989 or something). I like that she used one first person voice as well as the third person narrative in a well crafted and varied way.  I like that her main character has a powerful job that challenges gender stereotypes by being the morally questionable lawyer. That being said, she doesn't explore this as well as she could. We sort of forget that Ellie has blatantly suppressed evidence and watched as little girls saw their rapist acquitted. Rape, she can defend, but infanticide creates some problems for the notorious defense attorney.   Something about the book bothered me. Maybe I am reading too many of her books too fast but I am seeing a formula here.  - Many of her plots include a court room drama.  - All of her plots feature romance or end with the obvious potential for one.  - Mothers and their powerful (all encompassing, self-sacrificing) love for their children are a theme in all of her books I've read.  - There is usually a "twist" at the end. She's becoming Koontz like in her formulaic predictability and I stopped reading his novels as a teenager.  Most of her books left me content, like I'd eaten a good, hearty meal. However, this book left me hungry and searching for critical reviews to see if others shared my dissatisfaction.   So: - I was unimpressed with the "twist" at the end of this one - I knew "whodunit" about 1/2 of the way through. I was getting bored with that part of the story. The red herrings are too obvious and her suggestions that Katie didn't do it were there from the beginning. She should've stopped the heavy handed attempt to make us question that and just made it known through the 3 person narrative exactly who did the killing or hiding. Then she could have explored that character in depth instead of hiding her and others she wanted you to be suspicious about. Just because we, the readers knew, didn't mean that Ellie had to know - or anyone else for that matter.   - The characters in this novel were a tad generic. I am sorry, I like her, but they were boring.   For instance, I was bored with Ellie's dilemma over Coop - to the point where I often skipped the interaction they had when they discussed their potential future together. Duh, I knew they were going to get together after a little drama from Ellie through which Coop - being the quintessential "sensitive ponytail guy" - would wait, albeit in pain. It was just too predictable.  Hannah's ghost; she has a ghost hunter in a later novel and I was a disappointed to see another one. But other than that, Hannah's ghost seems a bizarre and meaningless addition. Is it to suggest that she, Katie, might be crazy and a murderer? Is it to explain why she was so drawn to Adam? Katie being the good Amish girl could only fall for someone who could share her secret ability to see her sister... In a book that is so Amishly pragmatic and logical in every other way makes it so the supernatural element clashes with the rest of the novel. Maybe Hannah's ghost killed Katie's baby or hid it.  I liked the details. The Amish and their daily lives, those who assimilate and those who don't, and how the religion and way of life affect one's thinking offers a neat, un-scholarly insight into a different culture. I liked the culture clashes and I wondered how they would be resolved. But what I did like, doesn't measure against my dissatisfaction.  My most recent book purchase included three works of fiction; two by Picoult and one by Atwood. I think I'll shelve the unread Picoult for a while. I'll have some time to forget her modus operandi. I'll read the Atwood and then I'll buy a book by a different author 
 The movie is great.  The DVD is not.  The French soundtrack does not play properly.  I had to return it for a refund 
 This is just a way for Urban Dictionary to milk what their site stands for.  If you want to keep up with slang, an offline dictionary is not the way to go.  New slang is created and added every day on urbandictionary.com; most of it varies in importance, origin, use and documentation.  All together, this is not an appropriate dictionary.  Don't waste your money 
 Johnny Tremain is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life, hands down. No book has filled me with such a sense of dread as I opened it like Johnny Tremain has. The way this book is written is as follows; *30 Pages of Filler *One page of plot For the entire book. That's really it. This haphazardly thown together clump of ink and pulped wood is like a swirling vortex of bad writing and mediocrity. I would not wish this book on anybody. not even my worst foes. I promise you if Amazon had a way to input stars lower then one, that vote would be mine for this book. Teachers; Don't let this be used in class. Everybody else; Spare yourself the misery and torment you would otherwise bring upon yourself by so much as reading the first paragraph 
 I found this book very unhelpful.  I agree with the reviewer Luiza about its shortcomings.  
 After reading this book I was inspired to do the same. So I got out on to the streets and applied Pastor Ted's idea.   4 of us started streetwalking 3 times a week when our spouses were out of town.  Then we added crystal meth to the mix.  Trippin!  After just a few minutes everything changed. The environment felt different and a lot of people tried that special, really deep kind of sensual massage, the kind of people that you would think never tried the homo sex thing before.   Streetwalking on meth is one of the greatest weapons against evil Christians!  This book is a short read but it can help you get started and achieve great release. Allways apply all the necessary protection, target the zone of attack, and start streetwalking!  Let the Spirit of Pastor Ted guide you on this 
 I live in Murrieta. I Grew up with brandon... God this album was horrible. I was even high when i herd it. God it sucked. Please Brandon Bolmer Stop sucking and shoot yourself in the head. I should have stabbed you on the bus when i had the chance you no talent hack. I hate this band. Despise. I know that kids are making a big deal over nothing. Watch, next year they wont even be around Screw Yesterdays Rising. Screw Brandon Bolbmer. 
 Maybe you thought Yumi was the main character, but the one to be most admired is certainly Cass.  She is the strong one, the stable one, the woman I most liked.  Yumi turns out to be a pretty crappy mother, among her many other faults.  It was an okay book, but predictable.  Although I saw it coming, the ending did turn out to my liking. Momoko was another undervalued jewel.  In the scheme of likeable women, Yumi (for me) came in a distant third 
 THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone.   This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role.  Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen).   By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother.  Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray.  Do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original.  
 Yeah, I am a big fan of moby, and accidentally buying the CD that almost ended his career doesn't shake that, if you want some good Moby might I suggest 18 or Play, this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise, but fail to build up to anything, everything else is Moby screaming in a traditional punk style, which were almost humorous, except, not [this much money] humorous, I am not a fan of this CD, I know he was starting out in a punk band, but his other stuff is much bette 
 Don't waste your money.  Their first book. Smoke & Spice, was one of the best I own.  The success must have gone to their heads.  It's a shame that they will surely make a lot of money for this poor effort only because of the first books quality 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This is a book that loses your intersted about 1/3 of the way through because the conclusions don't follow from the premises.  An example is that the author states that war has always caused economic conditions to worsen.  But he compares prewar conditions to post war, rather than comparing projected post-war conditions to those that would have been had there been no war.  None of us likes war, and delving into why humans always wind up fighting them would be interesting, but this book doesn't really go there 
 Benson has managed to remind me of Dan Brown, with all of the bad writing and none of the interesting research. The premise seemed interesting--tale set in the future and the past, with similar events.   Unfortunately, the writing was so bad that I, as a respectable Creative Writing major at a university, could not get through more than the first five pages. If you like endless cliches, bad dialogue, and thousands of thoughts in italics, pick up the new John Grisham and skip this mediocre tale. 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready. I don't know anything about what they have done in the past, except for a song I remember being played on the radio a few years ago. Must have been on the album prior to this. But that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. Not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests I couldn't really tell any of them apart. Horrible music with no feeling or soul, not even creative. don't waste your time with this. 
 The author presents the reader with an Aladdin's Cave of information. However, with only a cursery attempt at analysing the growing body of evidence as to the aetology and pathophysiology of these illnesses, newcomers to FM/CFS are left to determine that which is credible for themselves. With the gathering mountain of clinical and scientific understanding of FM/CFS now available it is disappointing that a book of this recency hasn't taken a more considered and focused approach. Veterans of FM/CFS will be disappointed; newcomers will struggle to determine the wood from the trees.   
 WARNING: Look carefully at the title listed above before ordering.  Amazon is listing the same reviews for both Maier's "The First Christmas" and his children's book "The Very First Christmas."  "The First Christmas" is NOT the children's book "The Very First Christmas" as suggested in most of the reviews and Amazon's own description.  It is actually a book for adults.  It is an interesting archaeological study of the story of Christmas, but it is NOT a children's book 
 The design for using the DC adapter with this little light is extremely poor.  It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter.  But, it must not have been very big.  I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case.  These were brand new batteries.  There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them.  This is bad.  Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.  Then, after I cleaned it all up, it worked for about a week w/o the batteries installed.  Then the LEDs started flickering.  The next day, it was dead.  To see if it had to do with the battery leak, I took the little guy apart and found that the power was still getting all of the way up into the head.  But something on the little circuit board must have blown.    The other part of the design that is bad is that the metal clip has a sharp edge that digs into and tears up the pages of the book.  I found this a problem with soft cover books, at least.  Putting a little electrical tape of the end made it better.  I had hoped that the design of this edition would last longer than previous editions.  I've gone through many Zelco lights and stretched out their lifespan by repairing the poor connections as they wear out.  This one is beyond my ability and I'm done giving Zelco my money.  They are a nice idea, but have no durability.  If they were cheaper, it might not be such a big deal, but for their price I would like to see them be far more durable 
 I found a supposedly "New remastered edition" of Sade's "Diamond Life" on sale for less than 10 bucks. OOPS! Great mistake! When I tried to return it, the CD store was already out of business, and the copy is one issued in the Netherlands which is marked INTO THE BOOKLET as "2000 Digital Remastered Version". The whole album HAS BEEN RE-RECORDED with new arrangements! The digital sound is quite good, but the new arrangements made for 'Smooth Operator' REALLY SUCKS!! 
 Spare yourself this grindingly tawdry recounting of Ms. Juska's tedious, unpleasant encounters with tedious, unpleasant men.  Far from being what her ad claims she wanted -- "a lot of sex with a man I like," which sounds frisky and appealing -- it's actually a dreary tome primarily detailing two things:  her unbelievable neediness and her nauseating tendencies to sweat, drip, ooze and otherwise leak under her politically correct drab Berkeley costumes. These absolutely endless descriptions are intercut with pompous philosophizing about Trollope and Bach and self-congratulatory droning about her work with prisoners.    I feel sorry for the editor assigned to work with this tripe, oddly sympathetic to the poor men she hounded, and angry with myself for being stupid enough to buy this book 
      I hated this book even when I was a kid. Lucy Maud Montgomery didn't know how to "create" a happy marriage between Anne and Gilbert because her own marriage was so disasterous. In real life, Lucy Maud's only friends were women and her negative attitude towards her husband is reflected in this book. Gilbert should have been outgoing, interesting, debonaire and REAL. Instead, he's a flat cardboard character who hides in the background. Although Anne is only in her late 30's, she's a prim and repressed matron who feels life has passed her by as she watches her children grow. And the kids are annoying! Saintly Walter is being primed as the sacrificial lamb and martyr--a destiny he fulfills in "Rilla of Ingleside." There's something weirdly disturbing and unreal about them...and their parents. Believe it or not--the most fascinating character is "Christine," the sultry widow who flirts with Gilbert and tries to "steal" him away from Anne--sort of! Christine is a little naughty and not very nice (by early 1900's standards) and she spices up this otherwise dull book.  
 I found this book very terse.  It seems like it could be a great book for someone already familar with topology, I don't recremend it for anyone who is not very familar with the subject.  It lacks examples of how to solve problems, then throws quite complicated ones at you very quickly.  A few mistakes in printing also 
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 Hey, congratulate me; I made it through 90 pages.  My main complaint is the swearing.  Good grief, once it started it was non-stop (I only checked the first five or so pages when I picked it up in the bookstore).  I would never be friends with such a foul-mouthed toad.  It should have been an enjoyable book, but it went nowhere.  The uncomplicated development took place in maybe the first ten pages and then the story should have gotten underway, but didn't.  It never started, never went anywhere.  Let's hope Anne Tyler can keep being entertaining.  Or try a children's book.  Saffy's Angel by Hilary McKay is funny 
 These containers are a great size and hold exactly what they say they will and save cabinet space.  Unfortunatly my sugar clumped up because of moisture and bugs got into my flour..  I'd suggest Snapware instead.. 
 I've always been a fan of Roger Moore's James Bond, but what I've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his Bond movies were, like, actually good.  "The Spy Who Loved Me" is not one of them.  Oh, sure, it's fun -- almost ALL of the Bond flicks are fun -- but it's basically just a kid's movie, and that's not necessarily a good thing.  (1)  Stromberg is a lame villain.  Yes, his underwater lair is well-designed, but it's silly.  Not as silly as that ice palace in "Die Another Day," but pretty silly. (2)  Barbara Bach is one of the very worst Bond girls.  She's not an ugly woman, to be sure, but she was a terrible actress; she sounds like she's reading -- poorly -- from a cue card in ever single scene she's in. (3)  Jaws is a stupid character.  Having metal teeth wouldn't actually make you capable of biting through metal.  The metal you were biting would resist, and you'd end up just tearing up your gums.  I don't expect realism from 007 movies, but I also expect them to not be outright idiotic.  (That said, Jaws is effectively used, and Richard Kiel was excellent in the role.) (4)  The disco score is terrible.  TERRIBLE. (5)  The plot is nothing more than a rehash of "you Only Live Twice," but on the ocean rather than in space.  Certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies!  Embarrassing.  I love Bond, but this is not one of the highlights.  The DVD is good, with a couple of fine documentaries, but the commentary track grates, because the director and other commentators spend WAY too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did.  Even if that were true, it'd be annoying 
 For years people have been calling this album a "masterpiece" but what's so great about it?  This is the sound of a man and his woman holed up in their apartment for far too long.  Really, is this the best Lennon could come up with after five years?  It's a shame he had to go out on this note.  These simple songs about domesticity may have had a certain charm at the time but time has not been kind to this CD.  The lyrics are mostly love letters to each other or their son Sean (who was five at the time) or both.  But there's nothing wrong with silly love songs, RIGHT JOHN??  Correction:  there's nothing wrong with WELL WRITTEN silly love songs, and that's one thing that Double Fantasy lacks.  "Woman" sounds incredibly monotonous now, even more so than back in 1980.  The one saving grace is "Watching the Wheels", an interesting observation of Lennons perspective on the music business.  The music, which was played by popular session musicians back in the day, is unremarkable and lacks distinction.  And I haven't even mentioned Yoko yet!  Walking on Thin Ice has a repetitive, robotic groove that appeals to some, but why must this woman open her mouth and utter such banal shrieks and shrills?  Kiss Kiss Kiss is the definitive low point for this record.  Yoko's orgasmic screaming on this track makes one visualize the ugly prospect of John & Yoko having sex.  That was too much for most people who didn't even want to visualize the two of them even being together 
 "When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'.  
 I found Henry F. Pringle's biography on Theodore Roosevelt to be bit overrated. Probably because it was published back in 1931 that make the material so dated. Passage of time and reassessment of Theodore Roosevelt make this book somewhat of an oddity. Despite of being published just 12 years after Roosevelt's death, it was interesting to read that this was basically a pretty negative outlook on a great American. The style of his writing, the way he jumped forward and backward simply confused the subject matter sometimes. It doesn't helped that the author never really get into the mind, personality and motives of his subject. Many of the issues surrounding Roosevelt's life are simply not in-depth enough to be interesting or informative.   I supposed for readers back in the 1930s, this book had a lot to offered. But nowadays, with works by Edmund Morris, David McCullough, Nathan Miller and Kathleen Dalton, there is really very little purpose in reading this book. It doesn't offered any thing new nor offered any great insights.  I read it because it was so highly acclaimed back then. It won the Pulitzer Prize and won high reviews back then. But reading it now after going through many of the modern materials on Roosevelt, make Pringle's work looked weak and stale.   Not really recommended for anyone unless your curiousity get aroused by ancient work 
 Followed all directions, added fish, within hours the fish were "sleeping" on the bottom of the tank. Luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so I took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better.  Changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water, added fish, 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom.  took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better. Something is seriously wrong with this tank.  Bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what... they are doing great!  Do not put fish in the shark tank.  They will die 
 Nothing new, and no new information in this book. It's basically just common sense stuff that most women know already. There was nothing earth shattering - and it's also kind of disjointed on topics (ie- chapter is about "x" and then they bring in letters from women that are totally unrelated. It's a waste of money 
 This was a very disappointing book.  Most of it flows like a string of daily recaps of the Athletics' individual games with expanded one-liner quotes from the three pitchers.  Those quotes are not particularly insightful, mostly soporific comments about each others' personalities or reactions to silly media questions.  It does a good job of chronciling the emotional ups and downs of injuries, streaky performances, and shortcomings of teammates, but it does not get into strategy within games, take a team perspective in the fight to win the division, or do a good job of storytelling at all.  This last one is an especially noticeable shortfall considering this book has the hard position of following Moneyball.  Urban apparently had no access to the front office as there is little to no discussion of the trades GM Billy Beane makes or the business end.  The teasers that make you want to read this book- complaints about tight-fisted management, Zito's dating Alyssa Milano, Hudson's bar fight during the Boston playoff series- are very short (no more than 1-2 pages each) and disappointing.  In sum, it's a full season version of a beat writer's experience following a team, and much of it, you feel like you are reading the local newspaper's daily story 
 It is CONSERVATISM that is a mental disorder! In fact, that's a perfect description! Conservatives think that marriage has a magical "sanctity" and that allowing homosexuals to enjoy the feat of marriage will somehow cause the earth to implode or something. They also believe that everything should be ruled by word of the bible as a mirror of the Middle Ages, just like the Taliban. Liberals try simply to reverse this epidemic, but they are simply outnumbered. 
 This product may be good for something but it is not good for plucking your own face. I was very disapointed in it. The tweezers were hard to push together. The light was too narrow to be helpful. The product was hard to position is a way that the magnifier could be used. I tried to use it several times and always got frustrated. 
 I recently ordered two of these antennas and have not yet had the opportunity to set them up on my CB radios for a test run.  However, I did want to comment about the packaging for the products which I purchased from Amazon.com.  The antennas arrived inside their original Mgf display packs which had been placed inside a narrow rectangular cardboard box with a strip of plastic air bags on either side for packing material.  However, this did not prevent the cardboard box from collapsing & bending during shipping, which in turn bent the stainless steel antennas inside their packaging about 20+ degrees.  I have spent the last couple of hours trying to straighten the antennas - the stainless steel material is not easy to straighten by hand, and I still am not done working with one of the antennas.  It would have been nice if the packaging had been better (and/or the boxes marked as fragile) so this would not have happened.  I am confident that these units will preform very well, but am not happy with the shipping - thus the 2 star rating. 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it 
 Don't waste your time or money on this book.  It was about as interesting as watching paint dry!  Maybe Danielle Steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out 
 I find Season 6 to be a somewhat tough one to get through, though I will grant that for many people, it is the best season of the series.  From my end, the season shines in the episdoes "Once More With Feeling" and "Tabula Rasa," both of which demonstrate the sheer genius Joss Whedon is capable of, and additionally the often wonderful chemistry of the Buffy cast.  Additionally, Season Six plays to several strong points - the ever gaining complexity of Xander's character, and the beginnings of Dawn maturing into a more adult-like person.  However, the season begins to falter on several points.  Some people may like the tortured redemption-seeking conflict that takes place within Spike.  I find that it often works, but occasionally gets somewhat ponderous ("We get it.  You want to bite people, but can't").  Additionally, while certain aspects of The Trio's hijinks are a needed comic relief, they fairly quickly lose their ability to hold one's interest and simply become an annoyance.  Perhaps the season's greatest flaw is that it frequently plays to the actors' weaknesses.  Alyson Hannigan does not play junkie nor bad guy terribly effectively, and consequently Willow's development and conflicts in Season 6 don't feel terribly compelling.  More problematic, Buffy's constant depression and self-pitying schtick becomes little more than petulant and irritating after a while.  As the season hinges around our identifying with Buffy's pain, confusion, and anger, it becomes hard to sustain our interest or sympathy after a few episodes.  All-in-all, this is one of the weaker seasons.  While Season 5 is arguably weaker, one still has to wait until Season 7 for the return of a stronger Buffy season 
 After seeing this film, I am pretty amazed they have been able to put what they did on to a dvd. I actually felt sickened by the images I saw and had to turn it off many times. Yes its an interesting documentary but can you imagine how the victims family felt knowing the images of their loved one being violently stabbed were being shown to people? Personally, I think you've got to have a strong stomach to watch it 
 I wanted to like this book.  I tried to like it, I really did.  But this book failed to capture me.  I love Andre Norton and grew up reading her.  The first sci-fi I ever read as a kid was Andre Norton's Solar Queen books, and I quite like the new collaborations written in the SQ universe.    Even as an adult, I can pick up and re-read with great enjoyment most of her books.  I often pull out my copies of "Catseye" or "Moon of Three Rings" or "Flight in Yiktor" for a great few hours of reading.   I'm afraid I won't be re-reading this book. For while the basic idea of this book is vintage Norton, the writing failed to pull me in like the best of her books always do.  The switching point of view threw me out of Laris' character, but then again she didn't come across as a very compelling character to begin with.  The writing was noticeably choppy to the point where I had to put the book down in frustration several times.  It's a fairly mediocre successor to the excellent "Beastmaster" in my opinion 
 I have to say that I was disappointed with this DVD.  The variety of dance styles it shows is nice, but the bellydance and bollywood sections were awful.  I'm only giving it 2 stars because it is the only DVD I've found so far that even touches on the flamenco style, which I've become interested in lately 
 We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new.   They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense.  I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash 
 I read this book after reading all the glowing reviews here and couldn't believe how much I hated it. It was long and dull,  repetitive and predictable, and it went NOWHERE. It was depressing and not in the way that I like. I actually hated the characters and felt a sort of repulsed pity for them...Their upbringing is NO excuse, either. There are millions of people who had similar backgrounds to this and still managed to become intelligent, sensitive people who are aware of the world around them and have many interests other than sex and drugs. To be fair, the story and characters do contain an unfortunate realism but...I sure don't want to spend my time reading about them. The narrative however flows nicely, the author's very talented.. 
 I am a teacher at a new school, and this was a mandatory read for all faculty and students. This Tracy Kidder book is about a man who has sacrificed a lot for people who are in desperate need. I applaud Paul Farmer for his work and giving nature. However, I question his parental abilities and dedication to what should be the most important thing in his life: his family. He will most likely never be around to see his daughter grow up. His unselfish (?) actions towards the Haitian people put his family on a second level of importance. Who is going to be the father figure to his daughter if he is never there? What about the abandonment his wife must feel? How about sharing a romantic French meal with his wife? Why not put this in the book? Kidder spent more time describing the relationship with Ophelia than talking about the docter as a family man. The reason for many broken families in our society today is because there is no father figure around for the wives and children that need him the most.  Is he working for the greater good? Probably. Should he abandon his work? No, but maybe balance is a good thing. He seems to be a person who backs up his talk with action. A lot of people criticize without doing anything about the world's problems. Farmer is not one of those. He reinforces his ideals with personal committment. But one couln't help but notice the socialist undertones that he projected throughtout the heavy and tedious narration. Instead of blaming the Haitian Government for the woes and poverty of its people, for the corruption, for the heavy hand of the military, and educating Haitians on how to better their country, it was the US fault for building a dam. Farmer is admirable in many, but not every way.  The Kidder writing had its moments of dry humor and captivation. But my genuine interest was not tapped until the two female doctors' conundrum of taking John to the US. The high point was how Farmer and Kidder demonstrated how useless the United Nations and the WHO are: a burocracy that should learn a lesson from Farmer. Action not words.  As a literature and foreign language teacher I found the narration troublesome and politically skewed. Some of the Spanish translations were too literal. The descriptions seemed insincere and artificial. I lived in a third-world country for five years. Pulitzer Prize? Not this time! Is Paul Farmer an inspirational main character and a good role model: obviously in many ways. Is he flawless? I'll tell you when I get back from the my daughter's art class 
 This book is nearly 200 pages of nothing but cliches and stereotypes, flat characters, and writing so comically atrocious I thought it might have been a parody; there isn't a single thing about this book that isn't totally eye-roll-inducing. Jacqueline Woodson attempts to communicate something Big and Deep with "If You Come Softly" and fails spectacularly. 
 I can tell you first hand how Amazon makes easy money. I am a formal seller here at Amazon. Not a big seller,but an honest one with a 5 star rating and zero claims.However Amazon allows dishonest buyer's to do chargebacks months after a purchase and then has nothing in place to assist seller's in getting their merchandise back. Sounds like retail fraud to me!! I wish there was a lower rating to give to this website.They are truly at the bottom! 
 Ms. McNaught is a fantastic fictional novelist.  It is hard to find any other writer in this genre who has created so many memorable stories and characters.  I can read her books over and over and never grow tired of the material.  But, this book is lacking her "magical touch".  It is not her best work.  It has more filler than story line and will not end up on my bookshelves.  If you love her work and must read this book than get it at the library.  Some of her best titles includethe following:Paradise,  Double Standard, Until You, Once and Always, Something Wonderful, Kindom of Dreams and Night Whispers.  Read these first and you won't be disappointed 
 This was my first time reading Kellerman and I'm not sure if I'd ever pick up another book by him.  
 What does it mean when someone gets excessively-defensive? It doesn't express that they have peace or comfort with themselves.  Writing sludge like this just fuels the fire - that I suppose they are trying to put out. If .. there .. WAS .. ever .. a .. fire. 
 This book is totally weird. The pictures have nothing to do with anything.  I was not inspired, my mother in law, an accomplished painter, saw nothing of interest. Check this book out carefully before you buy it, because it may not be what your looking fo 
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 If you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what's really going on in the world, read this magazine. National Review is for people who sympathize with Christian jihadists and white supremacists. Wouldn't want to be in that camp if I were you.  Read Time, Mother Jones, The Nation, or the American Prospect instead. 
 Too many numbers without enough explanation. Shandler seems to assume that you have been reading his books for years and have a thorough understanding of all of his metrics.  However, I do believe that the approach is sound. Including more commentary on players would be useful.  The primary advantage to this book is that it has one of the earliest release dates for books that discusses the coming season. Without much competition, what else are you going to read in the cold of winter?  I doubt if I will buy it again next year 
 The book is only interesting if you are an avid fan of the Boston Globe, as the subjects are almost exclusively the pols, "community activists," and entertainers idolized by the Globe over the past three decades. Seriously, how could a figure as prominent as Boston Herald columnist/Boston Magazine writer/PM Drive talk host Howie Carr not be included as a influential Bostonian? It couldn't have something to do with the fact that he is a staunch critic of former State Senate President Bill Bulger, a friend of the photographer's brother...could it 
 The book is interesting in that the author tries to relate human consciousness, quantum physics, and eastern mysticism to an undersdtanding of dreams. Some of his commnents are thought prevoking but the material  needs to be more tightly organized. He keeps telling the reader "I  will explain this more fully in a later chapter...". This made the 360  page read less enjoyable for me than it might have been had the material  been presented in a less conversational format 
 You can get all the same advice in this book from women's magazines. No new insights 
 My professor had us buy this book for class only to end up having to pass us alternate tutorial handouts and video trainers to learn the right way. This has got to be one of the most frustrating instructional handbooks I've had. I agree with others who have mentioned gaps and missing procedures in some of the projects as well as unclear instructions of how to use certain functions. Others may be too generous to give this book a higher rating but have agreed that this is not for beginners. Please do yourself a favor and get the Alias foundation books instead.  
 Lots of stilted pseudo-intellectual dialogue.  A pseudo existentialist hero. A painfully ideological lecture against the death penalty.  Stilted performances by brilliant actors.  A receipe for disaster.  Why this film was a hit, I have no idea 
 After reading this book, it is so obvious that the author/s know nothing about chiropractic. Have they ever even been treated by a chiropractor? It is also not very professional for one doctor to condemn another. I am an orthopaedic surgeon and I refer many of my patients to be treated by a chiroractor before the final choice of surgery. After giving a lecture at a chiropractic college in Japan, I was amazed that the doctors know as much about my job as I do! But how much does the author know about chiropractic?  It is books like this that keeps modern medicine  in the dark ages. Some doctors are even ignorant about the fact that HIV is the cause of AIDS! I have a copy of this book at home which I bought for 5 Dollars in a second hand book shop; if anybody wants a good laugh at a doctors ignorance, you can have mine for a buck 
 I, too, wish I had read more reviews before buying the set. Although the interview with Loggia was great (I remember him fondly as ex-cat burglar Thomas Hewitt Everett Cat from the old one-season 'T.H.E. Cat' series that played at 9:30 on NBC Fridays long ago...I think U.N.C.L.E. was playing afterwards, but I could be wrong about that...it might have been the season Star Trek played at 10), the number of episodes of the two shows was VERY disappointing.  If Disney can give us an entire 17 hours of Spin and Marty, what's with three episodes each of these two? This is not a good value for $35. Most full seasons of 25 episodes of most TV shows are in this same price range.  Don't forget, Disney, you're talking TV shows here...ones that you're rerun on your own channels. (Unfortunately, when I didn't have access to the network.) Asking $35 for six episodes is VERY steep.  I wouldn't buy another set if they issued another with more episodes. Too pricy.  bo 
 We finally broke down and went looking for a complete set of quality kitchen knives. The name Wushof came up several times and we purchased a set of them.  They work well until they started getting dull sooner then I thought they would . I have numerous sharpening stone ,(ceramic, diamond)and buffing wheels, and sharpened them myself to a razors edge.  Again they worked well, but soon became very dull. We were very careful in the storing and handling of them which made no differance.  They are well balanced , looked well made but are over rated and priced.  The 2 Mac Japanese knives we have stay sharper longer, take abuse better and sharpen easier. 
 One of the reasons I like buying on Amazon is because of these reviews.  Usually I can get a feeling about a movie by the reviews it receives....Unfortunately I bout this on sale as a "Previously Viewed" before I ever checked out the reviews.  The fact that they list on the cover that 2 of the writers nworked on Scary Movie naturally made me hink this had to be good because all of the Scary Movies have been roll on the floor funny.  This movies does have some funny parts to it, but not enough to really want t spend much on it.  The JayLo bit has been over done for some time before the movie so in the movie the giagantic rear end just comes across as silly nonsense....As with much of the movie... 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 I work in a school library and as a cat lover am always seeking out the cat books.  This one caught my eye and I was expecting something wonderful.  I found the story to be hopeless and defeating.  How sad the only comfort the father has to offer is composting tips and the last memory the child has to hold is that of a decomposing cat.  I'm no censor, but two thumbs way down.  Also, if you are looking for something wonderful for pet loss, try Cynthia Rylant's, Cat Heaven 
 Yeah, I used to read Cubiclegirl.  I'm fairly certain I found her a good read, well, because I kept reading.  So, I read this book and it was sterile.  I had nobody to love or not love or even care about a tiny bit.    Were there words on these pages?  I can't remember.  Sterile 
 I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.   From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment. 'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here. The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'. Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story. The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.  Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid 
 The book is really not that realistic when it comes to buying properties, especially for a novice investor. It helps with some real estate lingos but not with the trade itself. A lot of the examples are too shallow. It's like, the author only gives you an idea but does not go into details. Also, there are lots of "plug-ins" about the author's website and other newsletters. I think it's more of a sales pitch than a book 
 If we were not to educate or cause attendion to the Holocaust, it would already have been forgotten and repeated again. This book only prove the myth of an author's begotten desire to fund his own interest. Most childern will never now the story of Uncle Remus but lets all hope they remember at least who Ann Frank was 
 As a counseling psychologist, I read this book hoping to better understand the nature of this issue. I think Dr. Forward has a greal deal of experience and knowledge about the subject, and there are some helpful sections in her book. I feel, however, that the tone and way in which she delivers her information comes across as self-promoting, at best, and is presumptious and harmful, at worst. Through the vignettes and therapeutic dialogues, Dr. Forward paints herself as an expert who knows what people should think, react, and behave regarding this matter. I am concerned for the general public because Dr. Forward is so absolute and dogmatic about how people should approach this situation and "heal." At no point in her book does she qualify her statements or advice, which I feel should have been addressed. While the advice in the book may help many people, I would like readers to know that she does not take into account cultural, ethnic/racial, social, economic, or other personal differences that could influence how you perceive, respond, and relate to "toxic parents." 
 This book had some helpful information in it. However, if you really want a great book on bad bosses buy The bully at Work by Gary and Ruth Namie 
 Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice 
 How people can read and be fooled by the nonsense sprouted in ths rag is beyond me. All the usual suspects are found through out it's pages. This rag represents all those things that leftists are now notorious for: Polictal correctness, anti-capitalists, anti-gobalisers etc With all these -isms and ologies your in for a pain in the head. What's more the 'ideas' you'll find here have been tried, tested and more importantly failed. Ah well... some people are just too easy to fool 
 I agree with the last parent: It's a very fun book; Robert sneezes so much and so hard that everything falls down & so making the "achoo" sounds is good interactive fun.  However, my 4 yr old understands that it's a bit unfair that Robert loses his job just for sneezing and knocking people over; she says "but he coudln't help it".  So, I suppose there's a life lesson in there that much of life isn't fair.  And finally the Guns! Oy, this book I guess was written when the idea that kids can play with guns is just okay.  I skip over the text about how the guns go bang when robert sneezes.  Buy at your own discretion; there are so many other good books without guns that I'd probably skip this one 
 CRAP.  That's all I can say for this annoying movie, Amanda Bynes is a pain in the a** once again.    If I had a wider range of ratings, then I would give it -20 stars out of 5 
 One start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific  facts about the Ebola, but very weak regarding origin of the virus, very unconvincing about possible "theories". sound more like that old music of desinformation, he almost blame another monkey for the Ebola like they did before with HIV.. 
 What a disappointment this book is!  The majority of the stories are a turn OFF unless you're into a lot of girl on girl or anal sex.  I have Five Minute Erotica and I love that book.  It's pretty much full of winners.  With this book though, if I'm looking for a little inspiration before my husband comes home, I literally have to search for a decent story, flipping past so many ones that do nothing for me that I lose interest completely.  I actually went through and marked off the stories that were complete turn offs - 45 out of 69.  There are a couple of good ones in there, but you really have to search.  If you're looking for a great book of Erotica that you can flip to just about any story and get turned on, go for Five Minute Erotica.  It doesn't have as many stories, but you'll get a lot more out of it 
 Because I could find the Baseball America Handbook and having seen one of my classmates with it, I decided to acquire it. Although it is not a completely waste, it is disappointing.  First of all, stats like wins, saves etc. are not listed. I think it is important to have some idea of the basic statistics. Secondly, I do not like the organization of players. They list players who have changed teams on their old teams, keep pitchers and position players separate which can be hard to follow at times.  My biggest complaint though is the fact that they seem convinced that they know everything and that they are funny. As a result, there are quite a few snarky comments when describing players like Alejandro Machado (Nationals) that is not even close to informative and their attacks on Pat Gillick and Jim Bowden are nothing short of vicious.  For a prospect handbook, this is disappointing 
 Ugh!  Never having heard of the author or his other books, this is the first book I've bought solely on the strength of Amazon's  "Recommended for" list.  I'm disappointed both by the book itself and by Amazon's flawed ability to suggest books.  To be fair, The Amateur has all the elements of thrillers I enjoy:  foreign travel, word play, conspiracy theory, a parallel body of knowledge about which the reader can learn while following the main plot.  But it's dull.  The lines set up to sound world-weary or self-deprecating sound simply smug, depressingly self-satisfied.  Heller, the main character, has all the quirky tics of a Spenser or a Reacher, but none of the depth.  (Yes, even Parker's Spenser has depth compared to the hero of Littell's yarn.)  It' s as though Littell can't be bothered with back-story or background, trying instead to telegraph the results of a life experience with references to "his Mona Lisa smile" and the begging, sniffing, and returning of cigarettes.  Best line:  a remembered message home from young Heller miserable at summer camp:  "everyone here goes around in twos;  I go around in ones."  We do get a brief glimpse into the bizarre, self- aggrandizing, vanity press micro-world of "Shakespeare didn't write those plays."  But the self-absorbed and classist men (only men, of course) who burrow away to prove that no one without a title could have produced Shakespeare's canon are ultimately as boring as the rest of the book.  Littell writes good minor characters - Mr Diamond, Uncle Ludvic --  but one can't help wondering if that's because he doesn't need to sustain them.  Elizabeth is his best character, the only woman who gets more than a line or two.  Toward the end, however, she becomes yet another superficial cipher in the service of Heller's revenge saga.  As for the plot, Littell may deserve a prize for the most sustained series of coincidences in a spy novel.  There's virtually nothing else moving things forward -- certainly not the dialogue, which is both tedious and brief.  Over-all judgment?  Big yawn.  Spend your money on Daniel Silva - great writing, compelling characters, complex plots leading to the heart of varied darknesses and back again 
 Our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button (making the toy unusable), I bought another one.  Wouldn't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later?  This toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion...the manufacturer needs to correct this problem 
 I'm sick of this song!! It's overplayed...Can you people stop loving Green Day so much. They suck. 
 i love the colts, but this sweatshirt is supposed to be a large, it is the wierdest fitting sweatshirt i have efer seen. the shoulders are to big and the neck is to tight. i wear a large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward 
 3/4 of the way through and am just starting to be curious...I hate to not finish a book so i'm determined! I read thru half with nothing gripping me.  I was getting annoyed that nothing seemed to be happening....started thinking 'am I missing something?"  will finish hoping for a big bang... 
 I'd give this chair 0 stars if that was an option. The chair seemed great at first in helping my son sit upright and practice his sitting skills. He started using the chair around 4 months old. I was very careful in using this chair. I only put him in it when it was on the floor and I was always nearby to supervise. One day my son was reaching for a toy next to the chair and he fell completely out of the chair flat onto his face. Luckily he wasn't hurt and there was no furniture nearby for him to bump into, but this could've been a very serious and scary hazard. The chair seems like a great idea, but I really want all parents to know that it is not safe. I have written the company to complain and am awaiting a full refund. DON'T USE THIS CHAIR FOR YOUR BABY 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 The author cites the evolutionary and empirical evidence of modern day science and presents a convincing picture for justification of God, then completely deviates from reason and fact and concludes that science is a type of mythology - that we know nothing.  It was a boring read but I hoped for a climatic or at least informative ending...neither manifested.  
 If you're looking for a quick mystery read, then this was the way to go.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  After my book club read "Ain't Nobody's Business" we were eager to try one of Wilson Wesley's mysteries.  However, the group's general consensus was that the book was too short, too predictable, and the storyline was not all that original.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading her mainstream novels, though 
 This is a book about why digital is better with perspectives from several people. It is not about digital photography techniques used for weddings or portraits. I found no usefull information for me in this book!   It does have a few nice photos in it but overall I found it to be a total waste of my money. If you think you may want this book, make sure you take a look at it at your local book store before buying it. 
 This is a very weak book.  It contains nothing but disjoint, pointless tidbits of info.  There is little logical flow. Because of this it isn't suitable for beginners. Because of its basic nature, it isn't suited for non-beginners.  If you're a beginner looking to learn to play, look elsewhere.  If your an advanced beginner and you want something to doink with, this may be ok for you.  "Blues You Can Use" is a *far* better guide for the advanced beginner who wants to be able to play something 
 It's really not the authors' fault, but there are so many people that worked on this case, it is confusing trying to keep everyone straight.  Same with the victims.  To me, this book never fully developed the characters.  It's more like a rundown of what happened, but nothing of substance.  This book is mainly about Malvo and Muhammed, but who are they really?  At the end there is a brief conversation from Malvo that was very interesting because it gave some feedback on what he'd done, but that's it.  I just felt a void, like what was really the point?  By the end I was ready to be done with the book and move onto something better.  I bought this from a book club and wish I hadn't 
 One woman's anti-male fantasy passed off as scholarship.  I'd list my problems with it, but the dozens of examples below should be enough to convince even the most casual reader that this is a book for the serious student of history to avoid. The inaccuracies are numerous and the bias obvious. It is disturbing to consider that a virtual work of fiction with about as much veracity as Harry Potter could find its way into colleges and high schools 
 For the second time, I tried to read a Sallis book and for the second time gave up half way through.  He does have a nice turn of phrase, and that's what brought me back for another try.   Unfortunately, style is clearly his primary focus, leaving the balance of his writing in the two books in this series to shallow story line and characterization.  As a result, while the reader may be entertained by the author's style, there's no depth of story or characters to hold his curiosity. At least this time around Sallis didn't serve up another gooey helping of his syrupy-sweet (and Walt Disney phony) view of the Deep South, as he did in "Cypress Grove" 
 This book was a great disappointment to me.  The author has fallen into the trap of reading what she needs from her sources, whether they provide the evidence she wants or not.  I will admit I couldn't finish the first chapter and it may improve further along, but her rational for her conclusions escapes me.  The handwritten recipe books/journals/scrapbooks she studied could have provided a fascinating look at how women's lives and priorities have changed over the centuries, but her insistence on broad societal conclusions from these very personal documents left me cold.  When she directly discussed the documents and individuals she did a wonderful job, but when she tried to apply to the society at large their was a huge gap between her evidence and her conclusions 
 I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.  
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 It is conventional wisdom that good books are written by good writers, and that understanding of the subject is of secondary importance.  This book is a disproof of that conventional wisdom.  Mr. Olson is a fine writer, but he is not a scientist.  Within the first 50 pages he has spent 2 pages on an incorrect explanation of an important genetic concept.   Give me instead the real McCoy: Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza is a scientist with true insight.  His book, "Genes, Peoples, and Languages" is beautifully inspired.  He truly understands what he is writing about; and the most interesting elements of Mr. Olson's book are better handled in (if not derived from) Dr. Cavalli-Sforza's book.  Mr. Olson, by contrast, is a layman who doesn't quite comprehend that about which he writes.  He is the blind leading the blind; and most of his readers don't know the difference, apparently including  the nominating committee for the National Book Award.  
 I have yet to finish this book, but I've definitely read enough to know that this author did very little to no research when writing this novel. As a meteorologist and storm chaser, I've come to realize that the average person does not understand the dynamics of severe weather, how it is forecasted or how watches/warnings are issued; therefore, I will not delve into the numerous weather-related errors included in this novel. However, as a Kansas native and proud graduate of the University of Oklahoma, I was shocked and disgusted by the number of geographical mistakes contained in the novel, all of which could have been avoided had the author simply taken the time to open an atlas. It is blatantly clear that she has never lived in or even visited the states mentioned in this book. I understand that it is a work of fiction, but I expect at least some truth when it comes to geographical background. She did have a few Oklahoma towns named correctly; El Reno and Lawton do exist. However, Ponca City is also in Oklahoma, not Kansas, and I-10 is located across southern Texas, not Oklahoma. If this town of Promise is north of El Reno, which the author states at the beginning of the book, then it would take far more than 1 hour for the Sheriff to drive to "Wink" in East Texas. But surprise, surprise...Wink, while a real town in TX, is actually in the far western part of the state, not eastern. This would actually lengthen the drive to 9 hours, clearly NOT a round trip that could be made overnight. These are just a few of the ridiculous errors made by the author, by no means the end of the list. I will admit, the story is fairly good. It has to be, to keep me from forever closing this aggravating book of falsehoods. I'm just glad that I obtained this book from a library. I'd hate to think that I paid the author for a book that she clearly didn't respect or care about; otherwise, she would have taken the 5 minutes it would have taken to look at a map. 
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up 
 I guess I am the only reviewer who found this book tedious and banal.  It's more a series of thumbnail biographies of pga tour players, linked together through weekly accounts of pga tour stops, than anything else.  Feinstein's writing seems to move along at a brisk enough pace, but after several chapters, I found one event starting to blend into the next, one Q school qualifier after another, one harrowing tournament finish after another, and so on, and so on.  Feinstein's writing verges on being formulaic- it's all written in a sort of breathless, anxiety filled pace, as the nail biting details of who's missing the cut, who's choking under pressure, whose marriage is on the rocks, who's in danger of returning to Q school all gets mixed together in a swill of golf gossip and insider minutia.  What I found missing in this harried chronicle is any sign of the transcendental joy that marks golf at it's best.  It's almost as if Feinstein writes to show us how miserable and unbearably tense the world of professional golf is.  While some of the details he provides are interesting, overall I found the book repetitive and lacking in the sort of poetry that the best sports writing sometimes achieves 
 The picture was so grainy, I thought something was wrong with my DVD/TV. But not so, when I put in other DVDs they had a great picture.  The sound was good, but the picture was horrible 
 I expected alot from this book, and did, indeed, glean some useful insights. I am sure there is much, however, that I did not get from the work due to it's style. There is no focus in the composition, and most of the time it seems to ramble with no clear direction. The author does not state her thesis and present her supporting evidence; rather, she has an almost stream-of-consciousness approach, pulling in seemingly unrelated materials and ideas, depending upon the reader to make the connections. Her scholarship and love of the material are evident, but the author's style doesn't allow the reader to assimilate nearly enough of what she has to offer 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful.  Gracie, her ex-husband, her friends...they are the most pathetic, shallow bunch of fakes I've ever read about. What's even worse is that's the authors real life (maybe not the divorce part, but the rest of it).   In the end, all I have to say is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! I should of listened to the others, but I didn't, and now I regret that I wasted so much time when I could of been reading something worth while. 
 The text is a decent introduction to the basics of Biblical criticism and is fairly readable for first-time students in the field. That said, the author is given to overstatement of his case, often failing to recognize that the theories he espouses also have had some criticisms by other scholars. This leaves open the very real possibility of biasing new students against other theories prevalent in the field without giving them an option of weighing the evidence for themselves. So it's good, only as long as you remember that what is reported in many cases is simply the opinion of the author. (As a rule, whenever somebody says "modern scholars say", look to the evidence they provide, not the blatant appeal to authority). 
 How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject!  This book is a tragic waste of wonderful material.  I hope that another biographer with greater literary skills decides to take  on Armand Hammer 
 With all the reviews I expected a great book to start programming with.  However, after reading the first 50 pages I have learned not one single thing about Programming but I have learned A LOT about the students in his class.  This book is a total drag and a big waste of time.  It never gets to the point!  I returned it and you'll probably do the same.  I dont see why everyone is reviewing this book to be so great 
 Would somebody please put up a track listing, it's really annoying trying to get any information on this album.  There's lots of false advertising associated with it.  
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 Eden in the East turns the prevailing archaeological view of southeast Asian prehistory upside down. The author presents a view of southeast Asia as the cradle of civilization with the technology and culture of an Ice Age  southeast Asian subcontinent spreading north and west at the time when the  sea levels rose following the melting of the Ice Age glaciers. An  interesting idea, but without real support of actual archaeological  excavation on the part of Dr. Oppenheimer (a pediatrician). The author  picks and chooses data from many sources to suit his theories. A  questionable technique to say the least. The second half of the book  reviews the legends and myths of various cultures concerning creation,  floods, Cain & Able stories an so forth. Mildly interesting, but not  convincing 
 The story started off OK with the first two short chapters.  Then it falls apart.  The template is used but isn't filled out.  The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that.  Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction.  Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid).  There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's.  A very disappointing read 
 Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain 
 Henry David Thoreau did something truly magical in Walden. He brought boredom to an entirely new level I never knew existed. The amount of pointless and extraneous details that overflowed the pages of the book never ceased to amaze me.  I was forced to read the book for an english class. My life has never been the same since. Thoreau's brilliant writing technique has allowed me to realize the full potential of other "books." I often find myself engrossed in the phone book or the dictionary, which have become suspenseful thrillers in comparison to Walden 
      I wish I would have came here and read the negative reviews before I ordered this book. Buried underneath all of these glowing reviews are a few that were much more appropriate. This book is almost like studying German in order to learn English. One of the key reasons for wanting to learn about notes, scales, chords, arpeggios, etc., is to be able to communicate with other musicians. Like one of the reviews said, unless the people you're with know this system, it's not going to help. I'd recommend the Hal Leonard/Musician's Institute book "Guitar Fretboard Workbook" by Barrett Tagliarino. It's available here on Amazon, and is the best written book I've come across. I gave it a quick first read-through, and everything made enough sense that I fell that once I read it a few more times, I'll understand it all thoroughly 
 I was very disappointed by this guidebook. I added nothing to the Eyewitness Travel Guide. I highly recommend the latter 
 Yes, this is a good selection of songs from Sons of the Pioneers. Unfortunatly, the recording is also obviously created from old vinyl recordings. There is an unacceptable amount of hiss and popping on several tracks that really detracts from the music and I have yet to figure out if the recording is stereo (don't think so). I was really disappointed at the quality but for those of you who miss the nostalgia of a well-worn mono LP, give it a try. I doubt that I'll be listening to this CD much 
 If you like trashy, you'll love it.  I like a little more romance. This was more soft porn! I didn't see the romance, only the physical relationship.  It was okay 
 Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam, guilty pleasure of the middle 80's scene, she was the queen of Freestyle by that time, her music was around every club, and her style will remain in many people minds.  Her sounds were extremely danceable, although some people thought that her voice was a little bit squirky and anoying, it fitted just great to the type of music she wanted to approach, even her hit ballad "All Cried Out" a bittersweet melody with amazing lyrics, that will be covered later by many, fitted her just great, but undoubtly her greatest achievment was dance music, "Head To Toe", "Lost In Emotion", where #1's the same year and make everybody love this, sadly she became lost in more pop oriented tunes with the next albums, saving only "Let The Beat Hit Em" that it's truly a comeback to the dance music scene, but too late, the magic was lost and we should point to "Little Jackie Wants To Be A Star" as guilty for throwing Lisa's career to oblivion, but if you forget that and concentrate on the early materials you will find an artist that surface out of the bunch, because they were talented and had a new flavor to offer to the public 
 Why do most of us buy sharper image? Most of the times their products work well, and they look great.  This heater looked great in the picture. It ends there.  I bought three, thinking I would keep one for myself, and two for friends. There's no way I would give this to a friend. Maybe a stranger whom I didn't care about giving the wrong impression.   Pros: It's small.  Con: It looks cheap. It feels cheap. It doesn't work at all. If it didn't have the sharper image logo on it, I would guess that it was a 5 dollar clearance item at walgreens.  
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 Ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a "  cult classic" ( isnt that  what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch? )  or "underated" (theres a reason  it was underated -IT SUCKS). Brad Pitts performance was laughable. Watch any episode of Gunsmoke and tell me Early Grace wasnt a bad impersonation of Festus from start to finish. And that guy from the X Files ,David sumthin or other, mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film. This guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand.And Juliet Lewis playing a  yet another brain dead bimbo. Who woulda saw THAT one coming??? The only reason I gave this one 2 stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat. I think its called " morbid fascination", like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident - it repulses you but you just cant turn away. If you want my advice ( and you probably dont) take the money you were gonna spend on this movie and go buy a Gunsmoke DVD. That way you get Festus AND you get to watch Matt Dillon beat the h*** outta somebody 
 Easy setup, but who cares, when the end result is a very slow video.  Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movie "The Mask". When he whips his head from side to side and you see the "blur", THAT'S what you see with this webcam! Don't waste your money. I'm sending it back tomorrow! 
 The doctor used a broken thermometer, so we thought it was dumb.  We didn't like the part when the stranger played with the rabbits. We thought the doctor was dumb.The story was realy dumb so we will never ever read it a gen. we liked the part when he heard a thump and thought it was a deer and when he got out of the truck and he is stupid.           - 
 I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got.  I could understand why Rose decided to leave California.  I was glad that she decided to keep the baby.  Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter.  The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me.  I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched.  I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening.  At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal.  As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title.  It was frustrating and disappointing.  Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth 
 I love Christina's voice... and it's just not very well utilized here.  I can see why Christina fought the release.     The writing is bad to the point of being funny though (JUST BE FREE, the title track). I can write better lyrics than this, and I don't know you, but I bet you can too.   These are lyrics you expect on a "Mickey Mouse Disco" song or maybe slapped together for an episode of Sesame Street:  "Don't you see?, you just can't fight We'll be dancing till the morning light Just keep going, don't let it slip away There's no stoppin' till the break of day"    ROFLMA 
 I have no idea why I saw this movie in the first place, perhaps it was because The Jungle Book is a fascinating story. However I was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly   (in a stupid way).The action scenes were terrible. I recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies. 
 Very disappointing version of this story.  I was hoping to see the actual Horton, animation and all and this was a page turner with a voice attached.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Don't bother 
 This is one of the best Evans tittles, of course..., but at least this edition, (the first in cd, 1989), needs a deep mastering. 
 the jacket works well for shedding water which isn't really losing positive weight. the pants rip during the first work out. i've purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woouldn't rip. but they did. save your money unless you just want to jacket. 
 The audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep. Not a good thing while drivin 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
 The book is very nice and well done - as far as it goes.  That's the problem, though... it just doesn't go very far.  The pictures are very good and the information presented is very good.  But, the authors have tried to cover too wide a subject with too thin a book.  As a field guide for identifying insects or spiders it is almost useless.  While it is easy to identify the ones they have listed, there are just so few that you usually find only disappointment rather than identifications.  The subject should have been broken up into perhaps 5 or six books - each with as much content as this one, to more adequately cover each group 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 Those who listen to Maroon 5 are highly likely to be severely mentally handicapped. thus far it is unknown whether being handicapped caused one to listen to Maroon 5 or whether listening to Maroon 5 causes one to be handicapped. mostly likely a little of both 
 I made it to about page 100 before I surrendered - something I rarely do.  This book, while well written, does not move at all. Page after page of nothing. I'm giving two stars because I think that Stevermer is probably a good writer and is capable of actually creating some fantasy worth reading - this book isn't it 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 I honestly admit I did not finish this book.  The topics jump from one to the next with no focus. The author reminded me of my worst profs in college; a self proclaimed genius with NO ability to write or communicate.  
 I should of read the reviews! To begin with it took 3 weeks to get this book straight from Amazon.   This book is no more then a way over priced little 5X8 pamphlet.  I don't think I will be purchaseing anything from Amazon in the future.  Barbara Guilmette  
 I make pancakes almost every day (its one of the only things my toddler will eat) and it usually cooks one side, but for some reason turns off when I flip them half the time.  It nevers cooks evenly and every day I have to adjust the heat settings to make the same old pancakes.  I'm replacing this as soon as I can afford 
 I have read Ralph Kimball's Tool Kit as well as Nicholas Galemmo's Mastering Data Warehouse Design books recently - both are excellent for techno-functional professionals. This book reminds me of a textbook they made you read to have an overview of EDP about 30 years ago.. 
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 "Hailing from across the ideological spectrum" "twenty-one of the writers who have thought longest and hardest about immigration" - what a joke! Only one immigration sceptic, George Borjas, is allowed a voice; the rest are all drawn from the shop-worn ra-ra neocon pro immigration chorus, with a few leftists thrown in, whom TJ must have known in her college days. Even worse,as Steve Sailer points out in "Remythologizing the Melting Pot" on VDARE.com, she displays no grasp on  statistics and allows her writers to contradict themselves on matters of fact, such as why the German 19 Century influx was assimilated. Far better, in view of President Bush's Amnesty/Open Borders proposal to read Borjas' "Heavens Door" 
 Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper.  
 I cannot recommend this novel to any reader.  It had too many aspects of the countless, over-the-top feminist rants that are becoming so tiresome.  It was predictable that one of the few decent men in the story was dispatched toward the end so that the women could resume their life together.  The history, the relationships and the settings were unbelievable. 
 I was disappointed with this product.  The format is convenient, but the walks they recommend aren't real intersting.  Most of the walks are very short (usually only a few blocks) and are mostly in the touristy edges of the city.  I much prefer "Stairway Walks in San Francisco" which has longer walks (a few miles each) and focuses more on the more diverse interior of the city 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 i wrote a too lengthy review of this book a couple years ago yet Amazon.com printed my review..i see it's not here now!! ... this book gives some good physical practices like 'breath of fire' but gives so much horrid sociological and historical and philosophical information it's astounding..Indians lost because they smoked marijuana..dreams aren't helpful..ya gotta not eat sugar, caffeine etc. to make guru status..gotta get up at certain times in the morning and take cold showers? ... whew, all in all this book has an attractive cover but is an ugly piece of work...joh 
 I'm not a "jock" but I am a reasonably fit 50+ male that still runs, backpacks and cycles.  This book does a very good job of explaining why men need to be working out and staying fit, and provides good motivational information towards that end.  But much of the message is "To stay fit over 50, you should have been working out while you were in your 40's".  Well, DUH!  And as others have well said in these reviews, this book is way too short on specific examples of workouts and examples of how and why a reasonably healthy male can increase their flexibility and strength.  It's very strategic (30,000 feet) rather than dropping down in the weeds and getting  specific.  I don't want strategic- I already know that I need to stay active to stay healthy.  I wanted specifics, and this didn't deliver.  Unless you want a book on WHY you need to stay fit over 50, instead of the specifics of "Conditioning for Outdoor Activities" (as the title states), don't buy this one.  Sorry 
 Okay, Alex, I'm not reviewing the book.  I just have to respond to you calling people morons.  Yes the computer may make the "recommendations", but if you think Amazon was not aware of this recommendation and its potential to make them a lot of money - you're extremely naive.  I'm not going to be rude and call you a moron.  My mother raised me better than that.  Shame on you and shame on Amazon 
 If your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power, then maybe this plan is right for you. but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy. ie nuts, avocados, fish oil, even butter (gasp!) he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell! I've never heard of this phenomenon, I refuse to believe it, and physiologically it doesn't make sense. the only reason I gave this book one star is because of his advocation to "whole foods" which are unprocessed. contrary to what one "anti ornish" reviewer said, it's in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives. Many people in Europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market, and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two. AND THAT IS A GOOD THING! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives, the better off you are eating it. Long story short, if your protein needs aren't large and you don't have an insulin sensitivity problem, then you may lose fat  and become a bit healthier on this diet. otherwise, just make an effort to eat foods in moderation. it's as simple as that! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible. (no one ever needs those and in my opinion they aren't hard to live without.)and don't eat any more than you need to, to reach satiety 
 As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes.  House By the Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr. Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues.   Got that? Good, because half of that stuff never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths, makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around his son's head feels like self-parody.  Fulci's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad, but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse.  Also, this version has a "never before seen deleted scene", but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack 
 This is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn't finish this. It is drivel 
 This was a complete waste.  Walken is good, but God what a waste!  I never finished Strieber's first book which had intrigued me.  But in succeeding books, he does nothing to prove anything.  He gives a tale of experience that borders on religion.  This horrible, suspenseless, and cheap film gives nothing to redeem Strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke.  Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on it.  After all I'm not a UFO reasercher or whatnot.  But I'm still human.  I still have opinions.  And my opinion of this is, yuck 
 Although well written, this book has many flaws. It is very pro-union and fails to mention the fact that unions, especially in this town are [bad]. Where else can a slacker maintain his job? The book also is a very hard read and goes on endlistly about dribble 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 I had a very hard time getting through the 154 pages and almost couldn't make it.  Without a doubt Howard knows a lot about WWI, but he does not write in a way that I can enjoy reading him.  It took me a long time to finish this book and came out pretty empty handed.  James Stokesbury (A Short History of WWI) tackles the job superbly if you want an introduction to WWI 
 Don't buy peg-perego their customer service is horrible!! I will NEVER buy from them again!! 
 It's amazing to me how people can have such different opinions of a movie. The 5 star ratings are BEYOND ME but to each his own!!! This movie was absolutely horrible. I rented it out of curiousity thinking it might be a good horror flick. Oh My!!!!!!! I could not wait for this movie to be over with. Stupid beyond imagination! A killer snowman who melts and reappears where ever he wants to? There was some blood in this movie but that doesn't make this a horror movie by no means and doesn't make this movie any better. The stupidest part is this Jack Frost the snowman making snowball babies who try to kill people following in their "father's" path. This is more of a dark comedy than anything else but even as a dark comedy, this still remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen!! Don't waste your money!!! 
 The Executed God covers an important and controversial issue, but it did not rise to the task. I expected to be challenged by the author's approach, yet his methodology left me feeling ill used. Taylor's tone and presentation hindered his message. I found many of his arguments superficial for such a weighty subject. His use of Mumia Abu-Jamal echoed the cries of too many Hollywood elite. They know little of the facts of the case as available to criminal justice professionals, and they trust what Abu-Jamal says despite evidence and conflicts in his statements. Facts don't matter, only emotional responses. I expected more from a theologian and academic from Princeton. Instead, I felt as if I was reading propaganda. References to "gulag America," the "theatrics of terror," "big house nation," "lockdown America," and the like further confirmed this. I am well aware there are many injustices in our (and any) political system, and I am open to the possibile abolition of the death penalty. Yet, his use of these terms and method of argument make me suspect the merit and academic value of his work. I wanted a thoughtful, challenging examination of the issue. Instead, I got annoid 
 It's a disturbing trend that qualified scholars who are clearly not UNintelligent are playing leapfrog with sources, to produce an impression that is unsupported by genuine source material.  Unfortunately, this book is typical of many similar to its type - i.e., source material is not dated, assumptions proliferate, conclusions are drawn between one point and another as though the points' existence proved their relationship, and so on.  I hesitate to recommend this work even to those writing theses on the subject of early polytheism, as it's difficult to sort out what text actually says what and in what context, let alone supplying information on chronological reliability of sources, their dates, and so on 
 How Cherry Red allow such releases to be part of their roster (albeit under the Lemon subsidiary) is beyond me. I've heard several Lemon CDs now, and they've all clearly betrayed their vinyl origins with audible surface noise. In one case they've even ripped it from a scratched LP  This time around they've done a better job, but check out the fade from track 4. It's all gone quiet, then suddenly the needle jumps and you get the last few seconds of music all over again  Far from being furtive about this, they routinely trumpet their releases as "remasters", and have made several false and misleading claims about albums being available on CD for the first time  I don't know if Amazon will accept this review, but hope for the sake of honesty and fairness they will. Emails to Lemon about the poor quality of their CDs get no response. With so many reissue labels out there doing a fine job, this company should be ashamed of themselve 
 Delma raises the issue of how women lose their sense of self and sensuality in marriage because of how they live what she calls the delusion of the perfect wife.  [The reader is left with nothing on how many women actually find happiness in marriage, as if it doesn't happen.] The book then goes into individual stories that reflect how these women rediscover and re-empower themselves through infidelity.  These stories read like segments from an exploitive woman's magazine reaching for ratings by describing those encounters in explicit sexual detail.  While it doesn't linger on those details, it is obvious there is an awareness of "Sex Sells" in her approach to relating their stories; a big surprise in a book coming from a former columnist that made her living writing sex advice for a magazine.  One wonders if she could have sold any copies without the inclusion of personal stories and exploitation of the women she was supposedly enlightening.  The data is disqualified as limited, and she takes care to present the work as her personal learning from the interviews and not statistically representative and yet she then presents it as if it were. In this country a writer could find ten or twelve people that would give personal stories on any concept and how doing just about anything from praying to the moon to running naked through New York City changed their lives.  Delma simply uses the act of infidelity as a personal growth tool for women because it sells.  Not recognizing how the limits of her data or how the obscurity of the infidelity solution offered make this book dangerous for the immature or gullible reader; most others will dismiss it.  What she fails to expound upon at length are the ramifications of infidelity as a vicious and painful scar on the women's lives and the lives of the people that love them after having made this decision to cheat. She never once recognizes the ramifications for children or the families of the men they cheated with, nor does she recognize how the stories of these infidelities will affect the future men in their lives.  She simply discusses whether they should tell or not tell and how most of the time the act of telling was detrimental.    All in all, I see this as a cheap way to sell books and a sad way to council women on finding self respect or self worth. 
 Where do I begin in explaining this story?!?! oh, i know. it was the dumbest book man kind has ever written. But i'm 15, so what would i know? not a lot right? well i do know when i like something...and this i do not like. but if your a science geek and you like science fiction then this just may be the book for you!!!!!!!!! 
 What a terrible book. It's slow and mostly pointless at times. Think of all the excitement you have working in a cubical with situations much less funny than those you'd see in Office Space. That is the premise of this book. I went into this book thinking:  1. This a great author! 2. All the characters are about my age! 3. I'd love to see what working in Microsoft was like when things were just starting to get huge! 4. My friends and I are all computer nerds. This is EXACTLY what it are going to be like when I graduate college this year!  I was wrong on all counts. There is nothing I, as a 21 year old tech-savvy, internatioanl business major, could relate to. It lacks an interesting plot. It lacks characters  the reader can enjoy. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of a few mildly interesting situations scattered few and far between in the book. Go. Read ANYTHING else 
 This is what I call a "long article" book. When I was very young, there were general interest magazines that contained long articles. No such magazines exist any more, so long articles are made into books with lots of white space and sometimes chapters of one or two sentences. That is the case here. This book does talk about meditation, but is so specifically directed towards film that it will probably be worth the cost only to people extremely interested in how David Lynch makes movies 
 I felt it was very scientific and difficult reading.  I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although I am sure by the title it has great information in it.  I don't feel it's for the average person more medical / scentific minds.   Truthfully, I feel my money was wasted and wish I would of took the time to return it.   
 The book and chapter titles sound promising, but unfortunately the content fails to deliver. She just skims the surface of these issues and says nothing that isn't common sense.    
 My biggest problem with this book is that the title suggests material that is only covered in the last 10% of the book. I purchased it to get a lay person's view of string theory but the book hardly refers to string theory  at all. It covers a lot of material in the first 90% that I was already  familiar with and did not need another book to explain it all to me again.  I was expecting a book that concentrated on events over more recent years,  and not another book going right back to the beginning of quantum theory.  In my opinion, the title misrepresents the content 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 I served as a Member of The Force from 1956 to 1967 and this is a down to earth piece about what ( MOF) went through. Jurgensen was a damn good cop.  Every former NYPD officer past and present should read this book 
 For some reason, Amazon keeps deleting my review but here it goes again.  I personally found the book interesting when I first read it (particularly the box theory on triggering stock purchases and sales).  However, when I bought a later copy I found a newspaper clipping from December 1964 which stated that the New York Attorney General had sought and received an injunction against Mr. Vargas from promoting his book because the results he cited were not real.    I don't know how the case ended up because there was only the one clipping, but buyers should be forewarned before buying this book 
 I have been anxious for such a device for a long time.  I want hot strong espresso made in my office and not a bulky countertop model.  The first time ever I used this, I  used 'untamped' Illy espresso. Once hot the pressure started shooting hot water out the base of the bottom pot. (It was not the joining gasket area.)    Now that the pressure had broke whatever was holding it together in the first place the water leaks out just by gravity.    I will have to return this one and hope for a better made one but I suspect it is poor design and others will also fail.    In the meantime I am back to drinking the office swill.   #$&$#^$% the people that made this item 
 I never received this book.  Apparently it had been sold to someone else the same time I bought it - that's fine, however, I had to write numerous emails inquiring on the status of the book.  I couldn't get a clear answer for over a week.  This seller just needs to respond with correct information so the buyers are able to make adjustments to find the bookd elsewhere.  I ws on a time constraint because this book was for school. 
 Image quality is pathetic.  It generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest ISO (80).  Rest assured, you will be disappointed.  I returned mine within a day 
 Weekend Buzz is the only track worth listening too and you're better off saving your money if you didn't like the Harmony's Bhudda Luvaz 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 This is what happens when great authors go to seed. It seems like a cruel mockery of a Greene novel, parading the same old themes around, corrupted more than ever by an unjustified excess liberalism. There isn't a single living character here, and even though the prose is generally competent, I think it has to be buried in consideration of the man's memory 
 I bought the volo after reading many reviews. However, it was utter disappointment. As soon as I took out the stroller from a box, and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece. Yes, the stroller is light, and very very flimsy. I returned it right away 
 I purchased this set from amazon just a few days ago, when it was priced at $15.99. I had read a lot about the unacceptable image quality of these DVDs. Also, Disc 1's episodes were mistakenly placed in disc 3 and viceversa. When I opened my package, I saw that the back of the box had a small orange circle sticker with nothing printed on, nor it seemed to have any reason to be there, unless... FOX was quietly trying to tell customers in-the-know that this version was revised and corrected. Many DVD editions which originally came faulty and have been corrected have this sort of thing (i.e. Back to the Future Part II had a small sign "V.2" next to the copyright and Dario Argento's OPERA had a a sticker saying Version 2.0)... and in fact, this was the case.....sort of. The episodes belonging to disc 1 are now on disc 1, BUT the picture quality is still the same crappy transfer. Before the set arrived ,I was very eager to know just how screwed the image was... well, for casual viewers who don't mind watching VHS-quality content on DVD there should be no problem. However you don't have to be a technophile to notice that the image is lacking any detail, sharpness and contrast. I've read there is ghosting most noticeably on the long shots but I haven't seen it yet, however, I have only watched many parts of many episodes and judging from what i've already seen I'm sure there will be ghosting somewhere. There are also horizontal resolution lines visible through out every episode I've checked (however, ALL LIS season sets have them as they were apparently mastered from the same analog source as the Columbia house VHS tapes). Still, if you already bought the previous sets like I did you'll obviously want to have the whole series, so, the only thing I can say is that I hope you find it on a 60% off bargain like I did here at amazon, cause the quality is so substandard (at least, not DVD quality) that it doesn't deserve the $30+ price. At times, even the episode-name credit looks noticeably shabby 
 Perhaps I wanted the wrong thing out of this book.  I was hoping for some probing assertions and introspection about the role of the media, its relationship with the public and the government, and its future.  There was some of that, but it was incoherent and tied more to specific examples than to an overarching idea.  Page after page were tenuously connected stories where she tried to tie together a theme, but ended up completely disorganized.  When she did hit on a major theme like conglomoration of the media into only a few corporate hands, she automatically assumed that would lead to a narrowing of the viewpoint without explaining how the proposed bias would actually accomplish that.  From someone with an inside track, I hoped for more than just assumptions.  Similarly, her discussion of protection of source confidentiality was completely one-sided, with not even a mention of the ways it can be abused (aside from its over use).  The perfect example even looked her in the face, and after pages writing about the Plame incident she still had no comment how, for example, confidential leaks can be used for political gain and disinformation.  I was frustrated after about 30 pages, but stuck it out through most of this book.  If you are new to liberalism or haven't heard the horrors of the Bush administration then it might be useful.  Otherwise, it's not worth reading 
 One has to admire the career of cult director Joe D'Amato. He's made everything from action, drama, comedy, westerns, horror and even porn. And porn/horror.  According to the IMDb Joe D'Amato has 198 films credited as director and with all the names he used I wouldn't be surprised if he had more.  Anthropophagus: The Grim Reaper was directed by Joe D'Amato and written by and starring cult actor George Eastman.  The Grim Reaper has become quite infamous for the gore scenes and in particular the fetus ripping scene, all which I will touch upon later on.  Fans are in the middle on this one. Some see it as slow and boring, others as a really scary flick.  I normally like movies like this that move at a slow pace, but this time it just didn't work.  The slow pace worked great in D'Amato's Beyond the Darkness. The movie was weird and disturbing and that is what kept it from being boring. But here things in my opinion didn't work as well.  The first hour is painfully boring. What Joe D'Amato was aiming for was a feeling of dread, which just didn't seem to work like it did in Beyond the Darkness.  The characters also were quite boring. Had they been interesting than maybe what D'Amato was going for would have worked. The cast though is excellent.  Serena Grandi who is known as the Italian Dolly Parton is one of the stars as I mentioned George Eastman (this guy is great). And Tisa Farrow, yes Mia Farrow's sister.  But 3 good actors still doesn't make this movie rise above. Had the characters been good well I think what Joe D. was going for would have worked better.  As for the gore it's really not that much, the final gore scene is quite graphic, but the rest wasn't much.  The late 70s the gore films really began and the 80s it blew up and Italy capitalized on that. But The Grim Reaper really isn't the gore movie it's made out to be and even the fetus-ripping scene isn't a big deal like it's made out to.  That's not something we see a lot of in film so I understand why people talk about it.  I just never felt the dread D'Amato was going for. Eastman like always is great, but really not used to his potential. The guy is 6'9! But he wasn't as intimidating as he should have been.  Fans of Italian cinema and of Joe D'Amato might wanna check this out. Despite my feelings I understand why some love it.   I felt the tension built up didn't work, but if you watch it and think it does this movie will deliver.  Regardless of how I felt I'm still a fan of Joe D'Amato and will always buy his flicks. 
 Everyone else raves but I really really didn't like this book.  Here are my reasons: -  he rejects all herbal remedies because they have not been FDA approved.  I admit there are problems with quality control and no you shouldn't ask the check out clerk for advice on natural remedies but there are other educated practitioners, even doctors, who can give advice on natural remedies. -  he is too quick to recommend a hysterectomy.  While he says that you shouldn't have a D & C to try to identify excessive bleeding if you're going to have any surgery you might as well have a hysterectomy, forget myomectomy or any other less invasive surgery.  I'm quite happy that I got rid of my fibroids with a myomectomy and still have my uterus - thank goodness my doctor didn't agree with this book. -  the book is 4 years old now and doesn't take into consideration the recent studies which show that HRT may not be the right way to go.  I'd like to know how those studies affect his recommendation that all perimenopausal women take low dose birth control pills -  he seems to have only one answer for perimenopause and that's low dose birth control pills.  I'm always suspicious of complicated problems that have only one answer.  I'm still looking for a book that I feel comfortable with 
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 Enjoyed reading this manuscript but I wondered if the author had himself  read such works as Wallace's own "Malay Achipelago."  The  dedication of this latter book reads: "To Charles Darwin, author of  the "Origin of Species," I dedicate this book, not only as a  token of personal esteem and friendship, but also to experss my deep  admiration for his genius and his works." In light of this, one feels  that "Spice Island's" fairly dismissive treatment of Darwin is  rather unfair. In sum the point of view of Stevens is interesting but in  the end not particularly satisfying 
 I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie. The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be 
 First off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said.  Anyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good..  However, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though..  This DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD..  Finally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft.. That's a huge crime in itself. 
 What a bad book! terrible writing. Plotless story. Cardboard box characters. No descriptions. Ms. Malladi, please cease and desist from writing...especially your own 5 star reviews. Your work doesn't deserve publication even if you pay people to read it! 
 Unlike some of the other Little People DVDs (e.g., the "Friendship Collection"), this video is contrived and painful to watch.  Even our toddler can tell that it's trying too hard to be educational 
      No matter HOW you cut it, the FACTS (of life) regarding christmas, or Yuletide as it's actually known as, seem to always escape most fundamentalists' brains - folks, this is reality: most christmas traditions (as well as easter) are in FACT (GASP!) PAGAN. And it doesn't take a genius to do a little homework and come to grips with that. Why not just allow your children to be children, and ditch the dogma until their old enough to decide for themself? Or are you afraid that Whelchel might put 'hot sauce' on your tongue? But nevermind me, by following the tripe Lisa Whelchel and comrades are pushing, you should all feel free to do as they tell you! That's right! Feel free to do as they tell you!  
 My seat is BRAND NEW and I love it, but it has already quick working. I've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly. It won't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes. VERY DISAPPOINTED. 
 this is one of those bottom of the rock "slasher" movies of the 80's. the story rips off every other slasher movie out and doesn't even do that well. not scary or funny just a waste of time and disc space. save your money 
   This is the worst book I've ever read by Danielle Steel. I kept looking at the author's name to be sure it was hers.  So boring, so repetitive, I got so frustrated with reading the same information over & over just arranged differently.  She has some wonderful books out but pass on this one. 
 Well, lookie here, we have yet another band that decided to go ditch their previous sound and make a boring radio rock album. Okay, here's the problem, I picked up The Showdown's first album, "A Chorus of Obliteration", because it was a catchy metal album with some excellent leads. It took me a while to get into, but I enjoyed it. But here, with "Temptation Come My Way", you might as well be another copy of Avenged Sevenfold's "City of Evil", which is just bland formulatic arena rock. I downloaded this CD, because I wanted to hear how it would be. Well, it was deleted from my hard drive after I listened to every track on this album. I am so disappointed with this CD. If you're into southern rock or radio music, you'll cream yourselves over this. Old Showdown fans, don't even bother. 
 It seems here like everybody absolutely loves this book. Whilte it does have some witty moments of insight, I found the book to be enormously overrated.   The allegorical form of writing, as letters from a demon to another demon, gets old pretty quickly and it gets extremely repetetive and frankly quite boring. Way too much time is spent on how to tempt humans away from Christianity, and to a non-Christian, those long portions of texts are completely uninteresting.   Lewis does make some good points about human behaviour in general that are both witty and insightful, but those are exceptions and for the most part "The Screwtape Letters" is quite boring. The novella would have been good if it was about one third as long and not be so centered on Christianity. Christians will probably enjoy it more than I did, though 
 I'm disappointed to say this book is just one long 117-page sales letter.  Matt Bacak is a well-known promoter and marketer and this book contains basic snippets of information without really revealing much content. Lots of web site addresses and links to go check out but many of those just promote products. The information that is exposed is pretty old-hat in the Internet arena now, such as "squeeze pages" - there I've just revealed the main "amazing new" concept of the book.  I'd be less harsh on the merits of the book if it was free, but as Matt is taking your hard-earned money then the book needs to be judged more critically.   If you're a real newbie that doesn't know the basics of traffic or lead generation then the book will provide basic concepts. But to its claim to being an "Ultimate Lead Generation Plan" - well that's just marketing hype 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 We need the Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings Trilogy fame, to do this book justice.  The Book MISTS OF AVALON was WONDERFUL - this film was chopped up and missing so much that it wasn't really worth watching, in my humble opinion.  A waste of wonderful actors, terrible job on screen play.  GET PETER JACKSON and his production company busy on this 
 Your web-page is misleading.  It quotes, and the image displays, the Middle English original of the poem. The inside pages shown are from the Middle English edition.  However, (and the modernized title should be a giveaway, but it wasn't) the edition on this page is in modern English -- a translation, not Chaucer's poem.  You need to clean up this page, take away the Middle English quotations, state that it's a modern translation, and refer the prospective buyer to the actual, modernized edition -- which the buyer may or may not want (in my case I did not), with assistance in finding the actual Middle English masterpiece 
 ...who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange.  I love beef jerky, especially peppered and hot & spicy varieties. But this jerky lacks the chewy-ness that I expect in a quality beef jerky.  This stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy, grainy consistency.  The flavor isn't bad, but after reluctantly finishing the first bag, I can't bring myself to open the second one.  Perhaps I wasn't paying proper attention, but I was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in Brazil.  I would not have purchased it if I had known this 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 The book attempts to discuss the importance of multiculturalism within America's educational system, yet, the author's method of discussion throughout the book portrays biased and hipocritical views.  The book intends to inform readers to stray away from prejudices and personal opinions, yet, the author seems to include his own prejudice views making his book hipocritical of the very point he attempts to conjure.  He makes various comments throughout the book that disclose negative personal opinions upon current education within America's schools and educator's "white" methods of teaching.  I agree with his claims on the need for educators to incorporate a more multicultural perspective in teaching, but he seems to boast more on his negative views and multicultural issues in education throughout the book, rather than including ideas and advice for educators on improving it.  
 I'm convinced that I've wound up with the used copy of this album that the earlier Seattle reviewer had such a hard time getting rid of. Reading such glowing reviews here, and liking "similar" music like Zero 7 and Tosca, I snapped up the one (used) copy in the store. Disappointing, to say the least. On first listen it seemed, like the earlier reviewer said, cheesy and corny. I shut it off after about the third track. Then I thought it might be decent background music for work, where I have to avoid being too caught up in music anyway. Wrong! This album is just not good. It's almost mindnumbingly repetitive, so much so that instead of soothing and lulling me like this sort of music is supposed to do, it started to drill into my brain like some sort of torture device. And hard as I ended up trying, I just couldn't detect any kind of personality behind the music. It seems almost entirely derivative, though there are some nice effects with chimes and bells or something 
 This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book. His other one: Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is much better 
 2024 is about mindless consumerism. People are driven only by caring about themselves and collecting "points" to buy useless stuff (really, isn't that where we are almost at now?). It was okay, it only takes about 45 minutes to read. I wish the art was better. I don't enjoy the ugly comics of today 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 And so, the everpresent Smooth Jazz carries on in its elevator type way through some Mall in someplace. George Benson started this stuff off back in the '70's and though it makes me cringe to say it - he at least did it with some attitude. Mr Standring can clearly play, but as far as any Jazz tag goes - it kinda goes against the grain of the progression of Jazz from Duke Ellington, through Charlie Parker, through Coltrane each one pushing the envelope and being purely innovative.....the bubble burst and instead we got Kirk Whalum, Boney James and Kenny G on the airwaves. Booooooo!  Come on Mr Standring, at least put a little whisky in your coffee.  The only positive thing I can say is that the CD cover is awesome 
 It was slightly interesting, but I found myself skipping around in the book to see if it gets any better 
 Highly disappointing. No substance. It was a book filled with references to other books. Wish I had bought one of those instead!!! 
 some of the answers follow no logic at all and majority of the questions have errors.  Try another boo 
 These watches sounded like a good deal, given the original price.  I ordered two, one for myself and one for my brother.  They arrived today and both could not be set.  That is, the pin on the side of the watch which you pull out to set the date and time would not pull out.  They were both stuck in the case so tight I broke a nail in the attempt.  And I agree with the others that the minor dials are so small they are useless.  They go back tomorrow 
 If you're looking for traditional corporate global marketing think, the author ably extrapolates from past history. If you want to truly gain insight into real-time ethnocentric e-marketing, look elsewhere 
 You like repetitition, repetition, repetition: you'll love this. The musicians let fly oh so rarely. This one got hyped. I fell for it. Shame on me 
 My 9 year old daughter is very athletic and excells at all sports but these things are difficult to master.  Very large danger of ankle and leg injuries from falling and twisting the ankle.  Maybe it depends on the body type of the kid; mine is tall and thin, built for speed not strength.  Maybe a stronger kid could do it.  These are going back 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 If you're building a computer based trading system, this title offers some interesting insight.  There are several example trading systems that implement commonly used system features, and these systems are analyzed and commented on.  But this is far from a blueprint--the methods used are too rough to actually use as defined, and the descriptions are very confusing in many places.  Included TradeStation code is a bit easier than most to understand, but that's not saying much.  Every time I read this book, I feel like my time would be better spent reviewing Conway & Behle's "Professional Stock Trading:  System Design and Automation", which covers much of the same material but with considerably more coherance 
 How can people listen to music that promotes the killing of people because of race? It promotes hate crimes, death, and destruction....how could anyone listen to this? I would give it negative stars becuase it perverts  the youth of americ 
 Ms. McEntire sure likes her music loud and overpowering.  More is not better and this CD could use some toning down because some of the songs are actually pretty good.  Its the overproduction that kills it.  That's why I'm only giving it one star.  Listen to the first track if you don't believe me.  You'll need to take some Excedrin Migraine after it.  
 Warning spoilers...  In the worst installment of a bad series, Fitzchivalry wont die.  Perhaps the most interesting plot point of this whole contrived series is wasted entirely.  Fitz, who died, and rose again has his potentially interesting ordeal descrobed in perhaps the most boring way possible.  I supposed his dead body was infused with both wolf personality and human for a while (I guess souls mix when they are contained in a tiny brain), and of course the seizures.  Seizures trouble Fitz for a while, as long as they are convenient to the plot, and then, of course, they totally vanish.  While I found it really interesting that Fitz used to be dead, and the ramifications of that, we find that there are no ramifications whatsoever, except for a brief period of eliminate-the-wolf-behavior rehab.  I mean, he was reanimated after a period of time, but that's no big deal I guess.  Robin Hobb is such a good story teller, but she is horrible at plot.  Except in the Liveship traders series, but she must have written that one entirely differently, because you can't tell that this is the same author.  What she is good at is writing loveable characters, and slowly feeding you tidbits of knowledge about interesting things as the characters "learn" about them.  In other words she can "feed the fire" of the story well to keep interest.    But that doesn't mean she does it consistently, and this book is a great example of how even Hobb can utterly fail.  Robin relys solely on you LOVING the characters (which I feel she herself does) and she allows that to distract you from reasonable pacing.  This book starts out slow, then begins the ending phase of the master plot, and slowly slowly slowly panders through that and then ends in a rush.  Not to mention the fact that she knows nothing about plausibility.  This whole series is based on a character that is as loveable as your little brother, yet supposedly kills without compunction.  You know, an assassin.    This series asks people a simple question.  How would you describe an assassin?  Prior to reading this series you might say ruthless, cold, cruel, at best disaffected and callous.  Crafty certainly.  After reading this book, you would say, kind, affectionate, and loves dogs?  Add to that loyal to himself first, good natured, well liked, and an advisor to royalty?  So is Robin Hobb rethinking the role of an assassin?  No, you can't do that.  An assassin is an assassin.  You can't change that FACT.  No, she's creating a hero who was trained as an assassin, but who only functions as an assassin very very very few times at all, since that is a nasty business.  As kind and good natured as Fitz is, he never once questions the morality of killing someone because he was told in the weighty manner such a question deserves.  He never is actually put to any test.  So, Robin creates a hero, calls him an assassin, and swings the plot around to have him doing everying imaginable EXCEPT functioning as a cold-hearted killer.  He's a spy, a soldier, a telepathy partner, a wolf-buddy, and for some reason everyone just thinks he ought to be the hero.  When everything comes together, everyone just says Fitz, be the hero.  For no good reason at all (because you have telepathy does that make you the guy to go to?).  [...] Perhaps Robin thought the weirdness of the ending scenes would add a sort of tension, and of course, they were being persued, and so I guess that added drama.  But of course, the main threat, the "forged ones" were not really a threat anymore, but of course, you still have to resolve that issue, and was neatly done in the end.  But I felt the whole story, the drama of the "forged ones" really wasn't so dramatic, and I just don't get what caused them to behave just like they did.  On a fantasy scale, it was new, but not very interesting.  Robin does much better with dragons in the Liveship traders, and these dragons are just stupid.  And Verity-as-dragon is perhaps the dumbest of all.  Over all a slow build up for an overall letdown.  If I began Robin Hobb with this series, I would have never read her again.  I am forcing myself to finish the Tawny man series now, because I WANT to like her stuff.  But I don't know if I will EVER find enough time to finish that sleeper series.  Overall, try Ship of Magic, unless you are already invested in this, and have to have closure 
 This movie was a disappointment.  The story line was so dull!  Buyer beware 
 I am taking number theory and we are using this book for the course.  This book is so hard to understand. I have spent countless hours just trying to understand and comprehend each theorem and the examples are not helpful.  I  do not recommend this book if you are new to number theory 
 I bought this item as a holiday gift. It is a very beautiful piece and is artisitcally designed well. When we went to set it in its stand, however, the lip of the neck brushed the wire frame and chipped! I was shocked that it broke so easily. It's possible that they connected at just the right point and it was mere coincidence, but I am not getting another one to find out. Beware 
 I couldn't figure out if this was a novel or a liberal political op-ed piece.  Which is it Mr. Woods?    Two Dollar Bill pretty much follows Woods' imagination of the normal Stone Barrington agenda, with the inclusion of several underwritten and hidden political personal opinions.  Installing political opionions in his books have been common practice for Mr. Woods, I would know because I have read EVERY SINGLE ONE of his novels prior to Two Dollar Bill.    Political opinions are all fair and well...when incorporated into a politically focused novel, which this isn't by any means, but it would be hard to know it by the shear number of snide, unrelated, and personal attacks Woods makes concerning Bush Administation policies and general Conservatives in America.  To his credit, Woods did respond to an e-mail I sent him inquiring as to why he did this, but couldn't provide ANY justification for it.  Merely that it was his right to do so.  And you are correct Mr. Woods, it is your right to do so...just like it was my right to make the conscience decision not to read any more of your books, which I am happy to say that I haven't.  And coming from a person (me) who has ALL of your novels (with the exception of one) in hard back, most of which are signed, is quite a statement to make.  I've been a fan of yours since the early 90's, but cannon continue to be with your recent, and quite obvious, politically motivated agenda.  Good day to you 
 If you're looking for a quick mystery read, then this was the way to go.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  After my book club read "Ain't Nobody's Business" we were eager to try one of Wilson Wesley's mysteries.  However, the group's general consensus was that the book was too short, too predictable, and the storyline was not all that original.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading her mainstream novels, though 
 watched like reading a comic book. so many murders for so little money. corpses never turned stink in the thailand humid and hot temperature. lousy acting, directing and totally stupid screenplay with twisted to the limit ridiculousness and impossibility. a story so bad that turned into a disturbing watch. boasted with awards and high praises for the primitiveness or roughness of the poor plot and scenario? give me a break 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 Well,I'm afraid there's almost nothing positive to say about this movie.The plot is ridiculous,the directing is terrible,most of the acting is unbearable and the music is getting on one's nerves. If you are a fan of season one (like me),this movie will totally disappoint you.It has nothing to do with lifeguarding,it's nothing more than another opportunity for the "Baywatch Babes" to show their (barely dressed) bodys.Entertainment at its worst! There are only two persons you can really call actress/actor.Alexandra Paul and John Allen Nelson are really wasting their talents on this movie. You better watch the great episodes of season one and forget about this movie which is a waste of time and money! 
 I preordered this book in hardback, as I have all the author's books since they first started coming out in hardback, but I am just now barely getting through it.  I loved the earlier dog training oriented books in the series and sometimes reread them.  But I must confess the later books seem to be less and less interested in dogs.  And even though the mystery aspect of the novels have always taken second place to the dogs, these later novels are even less interested in crafting a mystery.  What substitutes are more pages of trivia and rambling introspection that seem unrelated to dogs or the plot of the novel.    In this one, I found the mystery incomprehensible. Why would Mac, who seemed to be well off and relatively easygoing if a philanderer, whose kids liked him, and who was reported as begging his wife to forgive him, ever give a wife an ultimatum that she could have no more dogs? Perhaps I missed something -- I was skimming through the book a lot. But the murderer's -- and even the philandering husband's -- motives and actions weren't believable.  Their resolution was also handled "off stage",  in a rush, and left me feeling still more unconvinced as to why the characters acted as they did.  This book, which was a "finale" of sorts in that it involved the marriage of Steve and Holly deserved more attention to producing a believable mystery and more effort in the final resolution of it.  Regarding the trivia, it seems to serve as a way of providing exposition as opposed to dialogue. Whatever happened to bringing characters into the story, to Holly sleuthing and searching to give us some of the information in dialogue instead of having Holly searching the web and giving us a precis of her finds, or having us read emails?  Dialogue, as opposed to narrative exposition would have forwarded the story better.  This novel also seemed disjointed in a lack of real connection between characters and the two main plots.  It would have been better if the mystery and the wedding had been constructed to dovetail, instead of two relatively unrelated plots jogging along, uncoordinated.  Have the murder involve the characters at some wedding planning shop run by some dog lover with a philandering husband.  Or a murder between some patrons of a wedding shop or wedding related business.  Or at a dog training club where Holly went to give her dogs practice in not eating the flower collars (given malamutes eat everything, it was puzzling they should be indifferent to those and that we were given so little info on training for the wedding. That seemed an opportunity lost).  If the murder was more related to the wedding,  some of the information could have been more easily relayed in dialogue even without Holly having to do much sleuthing, as well as tying the mystery to the wedding, instead of so much narrative. The murder and wedding could have proceeded more naturally together.    It would have been nice too, if the familiar characters had more than walk on parts in the novel.  Keven could have spent some time solving the murder while Holly and the rest had their wedding planning around it and him.  Rita could have come in for dispensing some shrink advice on pre wedding jitters, given Holly's resistance to marriage before.  The subplot involving Rita and her philandering boyfriend in some respects had even more attention paid to it than the actual murder mystery, but did nothing to further the two main plots of wedding and murder.  Rita could have had other more relevant roles.  And Steve needed to be much less than a cipher through this.  He seems to show up to bring dinner and take Holly to bed and that's pretty much it for him. Instead, Rita had her own subplot, Kevin's involvement in the mystery was perfunctory, at best, and Steve didn't seem to have much to do at all.  I would have liked to have seen more relation between the characters (these are after all, cozy mysteries) more coordinated plots, more dialogue with each other and much less of the pages of filler.  It would have resulted in a better, tighter mystery.  I'm hoping the promise of the first few books gets renewed by the author putting a little more effort into the nuts and bolts of writing.  In the meantime, I probably am going to hold back on preordering the hardbacks -- which I regret -- and wait to see. I keep hoping some editor is going to take this author by the hand a little.  To put it in words Holly might understand, this was a good writer who -- like a formerly well trained dog whose owner has lapsed on training sessions -- needs to return, reinforce and work on those basics that were practiced in the first books of the series.  
 It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC.  I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it.   Very disappointing 
 I have used MS streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year. It has some map errors that I wish were updated. I read that The Delorme Street Atlas was far superior, so I bought it. It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems. Not only is the mapping way out of date (Many years) Microsoft Streets and trips 2006 Maps are far more up to date. On many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road doesn't exist in that direction. It doesn't even know the name of some very old roads Displays..."Unknown Name" While driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that I am driving 30 feet below. The program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a U-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp. I have used Microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable. The Delorme is very confusing and frustrating. I'm sending it back for a full refund 
 It's a pretty sad world if the stories of Harry Potter cause controversy.  There is NOTHING controversial about these thrilling, fiction novels.  I feel that the churches should have other things to worry about... and if they do not, I am scared of our future.  Anyone who can find Harry Potter to associate with Lucifer has serious mental problems and should probably go see a psychiatrist 
 Nicely drawn characters; good writing; different and compelling story. Why don't I like it, then? Because of what the author did with these things. It ends in disaster and proves nothing. Afterwards, I find that this novel lingers in the mind like a bad taste in the mouth. I wish to God I'd never read it 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 it's horrible.. you imagine that now you could put your TV up your wall and you get this box filled wit just 3 metal piece and bunch of screws and with a crappy instruction manuel. the instruction mannnel doesn't explain at all. it's difficult to attach the parts to your TV, it doesn't work with all kind of LCD tvs, it only works wit some specific parts of walls of your house. The only thing I could say is.. "DON'T BUY IT 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 "The Third Sister", a Sense & Sensibility sequel, treads shallow waters, compromising between the two Barret `extremes' by being sufficiently plotted, but dull and predictable. Margaret, miraculously transformed into a fine, intelligent young lady (one has the impression that Barret watched Emma Thompson's film, which included a lively, appealing child Margaret) has to choose between two young men, one resembling Edward Ferrars in his reserve and quiet demeanor, the other resembling Willoughby in his good looks and `liveliness'. Unpredictably-or is it with complete predictability?- they are neither what Margaret thinks they are. And they are both shallow characters, very much like Margaret. There is very little emotional development and resonance between either and Margaret.  The language is just barely adequate, the events so unmemorable that I can just recall the skeleton of the plot relating to Margaret after 2 years of reading the book. If you must read something else by Barret, read "Presumption". If you wish for an excellent Austen sequel, read "Sanditon", completed by Marie Dobbs 
 I found this one to be very predictable! I don't ususally come up with the ending until very close to the end. But, with this one, I figured it out right off the bat! It was too easy! It was an okay read, but very easy to figure out 
 The movie itself is a snoozer.  There's a good amount of physical comedy, but the story just went nowhere.  However, the running commentary is hilarious!  When the commentary is funnier than the movie, you know the movie is pretty bad 
 Whoever is marketing this should be whipped with razor wire. Do not buy, unless you enjoy wasting your money 
 Other than defining "rankism", there is not much else to this book. The author spends most of the book defining and giving examples of rankism.  He does not talk much about "overcoming the abuse of rank", as the title suggests he will.  He cites a few examples of where some groups are already making progress, but he does not really say what others should do, except maybe "join together".  On some occasions, seems to be implying that the world is on its way to eliminating rankism, so we can just sit back and wait for this new utopia to come about. He also likes to compare rankism to both sexism and racism.  He suggests that rankism can be eliminated, just like sexism and racism have been.  Huh?  There has been progress made against these other "isms", but Fuller really is living in an ivory tower if he thinks they no longer exist. "Somebodies and Nobodies" does a decent job of pointing out that rankism exists, but does very little to provide answers 
 This book's title shows that "qualitative research" is its primary subject, and "developing grounded theory" is its secondary subject. The opposite is true in the case of the book coauthored earlier by Strauss: "The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research." In the interval between the writing of the two books, Strauss may have realized that his thesis was about research work more than theory construction. But the text of this second book too presents research work as theory construction, as explained below. It could be thought that what is to be called a "theory" is a linguistic issue. But the definition of this term must not prevent the construction of real theories as distinct from empirical knowledge.  In lieu of  the implicit definition of "theory" that appeared in the earlier book (p. 1), an explicit one is given in this second book: "A set of well developed concepts related through statements of relationship, which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used to explain or predict phenomena" (p. 15). The new and critical but obscure expressions in this definition are "well developed concepts" and "integrated framework," whereas the idea of explaining or predicting phenomena by using a theory appeared also in the earlier definition. As I mentioned in my review of the earlier book, explaining or predicting phenomena can be done by using empirical knowledge too and therefore cannot be considered a distinguishing characteristic of theories. For example, the empirical laws of electromagnetism known before Maxwell served to explain, predict, and control many electromagnetic phenomena but did not constitute a theory. The authors repeat the same mistake when they admit that "a theory is more than a set of [empirical] findings;" and continue by saying, "it offers an explanation of phenomena" (p.22). They also say, "generating theories about phenomena, rather than just generating a set of findings, is important to the development of a field of knowledge" (pp. 22-23). That is correct, but the problem is to know how theories are generated. Also, "findings" too serve to explain phenomena, as mentioned, although they have a narrower scope than theories.      "Statements of relationship [between phenomena] are commonly referred to as `hypotheses'" (p. 103). "Any hypotheses and propositions derived from data must be continuously `checked out' against incoming data and modified, extended, or deleted as necessary" (p. 22). The key concept here, which the authors do not clarify sufficiently, is the derivation of hypotheses from data. First, some relationships between phenomena can be deduced from the data. But what is thus produced constitutes not a hypothesis but empirical knowledge about those phenomena. It is when those relationships are "generalized through induction," in Newton's words, that they become general rules which are of hypothetical nature, or hypotheses, because induction yields only probabilities, not certainties, as Bertrand Russell emphasized. The authors seem to ignore this fact. Moreover, when the hypotheses thus derived from data are "continuously `checked out' against incoming data and modified, extended, or deleted as necessary" and those that are conserved are finally supported by all new information, they stop being hypotheses and become empirically known facts. And any set of such facts constitutes empirical knowledge, not a theory.  The authors seem not to have a clear view of where induction and deduction are used. "Anytime a researcher derives hypotheses from data, because it involves interpretation, we consider that a deductive process" (p. 22). A relationship that is deduced from the data related to some singular phenomena constitutes empirical knowledge about those phenomena. A hypothesis is created out of that knowledge when it is "generalized through induction." The total process is not only deduction but involves also  induction. The authors express these facts in an obscure way thus: "At the heart of theorizing lies the interplay of making inductions (deriving concepts, their properties, and dimensions from data) and deductions (hypothesizing about the relationships between concepts, the relationships also are derived from data, but data that have been abstracted by the analyst from the raw data)" (p. 22). What the authors unclearly describe as "abstracted by the analyst from the raw data" is what Newton meant by the words "generalized through induction." And the generalization must cover phenomena that do not allow the deduction of the hypothesis from the data if the hypothesis is expected to be used to construct a theory. The authors conclude: "At the end, it is hoped, the researcher has systematically developed the products of analysis into a theory" (p. 22). The major mistake in this conception of theory construction is that it ignores the following fact: A hypothesis that is "checked out against incoming data," (i.e. fits the data, is deducible from the data) is no more a hypothesis but empirical knowledge and therefore a system of statements only such hypotheses constitutes not a theory but a group of empirical knowledge. The authors repeat the same mistake when they say that a theory "is validated during the actual research process" (213). What can be validated during the "actual" (original) research process is empirical knowledge. A second phase of research is concerned with the validation of the theory, i.e. with showing that the consequences of the theory fit the phenomena, or that they are deducible not only from the theory but also from the phenomena. Consequently, the theory becomes usable in explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomena.   Only when knowledge that is deduced, or readily obtained, from the raw data related to some singular phenomena is "generalized through induction" and assumed, or hypothesized, to be valid also in relation to phenomena that do not make possible the deduction of that hypothesis from the data that a hypothesis is created that can be used to construct a theory. This means that a theory contains at least one hypothesis that cannot be deduced from the empirical data related to all phenomena to which it is assumed to apply. The reason for this is that a law of nature may be deduced from the data related to some phenomena but not from the data related to other phenomena. Consequently, by transferring knowledge from one set of phenomena to another can provide hypothetical knowledge that is otherwise unavailable. A theory is a set of general statements, or laws, of which at least one is such a non-testable hypothesis at the time of the construction of the theory. After a theory is thus constructed, consequences are deduced from it that serve to explain, predict, and control the related phenomena. The usefulness of a theory in doing these things constitutes the proof of its usability and also the proofs of all of its contents, including the non-testable hypothesis, or hypotheses. When phenomena that do not fit a tested and accepted theory are encountered, a more general theory is constructed. The old theory is not discarded by being considered wrong but remains in use in the area where it is valid, because it is simpler than the more general theory.  The above-presented knowledge about the content and the method of construction of theories is derived from the grand theories of physics. I have shown in my books how the same method can be used in psychology too. As an example, I constructed a theory of automatic responses such as the symptoms of non-organic mental disorders, dreams, cerebral lateralization as structural response, etc. This theory serves not only to explain and predict those phenomena but also to control them very effectively where this is possible. I had to mention these here because the best test of ideas is their usefulness in explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomena.  Although Strauss and Corbin advocate what they call "grounded theory," which is in reality nothing else than empirical knowledge, they expose their distrust of their work, which contains many unclear points, when they warn the reader by saying, "Remember that a theory is just that - a theory" (p. 213). Theories inspire more respect when their method of construction and their function are better understood.   
 I am astonished that this book might be the support material of a Harvard course... First of all, there is a massive mistake on the backcover of the book "Jean-Francois Le Pen" is in fact "Jean-Marie Le Pen". It is such an obvious mistake - it looks like a joke ! But OK, let's admit it's only a translation mistake, it doesn't change the overall quality of the book.  Just to let you know, the author is part of the left side of the french left wing - She is a typical example of the generation of "soixante-huitard" french intellectuals, who use to support the maoism if not the stalinism. 
 Quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time. Clive Owen is really cool, but not in this movie. Angelina Jolie's polital agenda totally fueled this film. What a waste of time 
 David Thomson thinks he's some kind of superior being and criticizes in a pompous and condescendent manner everything Welles ever did. He's one of those people who think that Welles never achieved anything after Kane. He wonders if he was even really responsible for Kane? He states that Welles did not write any of the script (false), that Greg Toland was director of photography while Robert Wise was responsible for the editing. SO what did Welles do? He directed! Apparently, that's not enough to make Kane his movie, his masterpiece, among others. Well if movies were only based on photography, scripting and editing, then why would directors be needed?  Thomson insults Welles in every paragraph; he hammers him over and over, relentlessly. He focuses on the less successful aspects of his life and exaggerates them. He ridicules him, makes fun of his weight, says he's egotistical, a liar, a misogynist, an unfaithful friend, a machiavellic mischievous man who uses people, cheats on his wives, dates married women, eats like a pig and stuffs his face with anything he could find (he talks a lot about that), a pretend genius or would be genius who thinks he's the victim of evil Hollywood moguls. What other bad things could be said about Welles? Basically, any insult or evil thought you would ever have towards your worse enemy would not match up to the way Thomson writes about Welles.  Welles is not the only target of the author's wrath towards famous people. Any dead actor that was a friend or acquaintance of welles is also treated unkindly, as for the ones who are still alive, Thomson refrains himself from making a judgement. What a coward! Dead celebrities are such easy targets to criticism aren't they?  When Thompson runs out of evil things to say, he talks about his childhood and when he went to see The Third Man with his grand mother who for some reason has a claw instead of a hand. Oh poor little David, he could not hold his grandma's hand, only a claw! Tear. Who cares! Also, he has the annoying habit of interrupting every other chapter with imaginary conversations between the writer (?) and the publisher (?). It's never quite clear and really pointless. It's a way for him to put himself in value and shows how he can also criticize his own work. What a decent man!...  I was not expecting a hagiography, I know Welles was not godlike. Thomson explains at the end of the book that he does not mean to put Welles down, but only attempts to humanize him. Well there's a difference between humanizing someone and destroying the truth. Also, a biography should include anecdotes, facts, it should be detailed and accurate. Thompson writes some kind of very superficial, selective, inaccurate story, with imaginary dialogues about what people could have said to welles or thought of him. You can't assume things in a biography.  The author is too involved with his own thoughts instead of sticking to the facts in an objective manner. If you want to learn about Welles, read "Road to Xanadu' by Simon Callow, which focuses on Welles life up to Kane. Or "This is Orson Welles" which is a series of Welles interviews conducted by Peter Bogdanovich in which Welles tells the story of his life. Sure he had a tendency of lying about his past, but only because he was a story teller. Story Tellers always add a little to the truth. Thomson has no such skill.  Unfortunately I can't give 0 star to this book, or I would. It's really just food for the shredder 
 I have every single volume and love them all.  However, this one was super disappointed with this last volume that I couldn't wait to receive. The CD Album aesthetics were very tasteful but I also (as another reviewer) fear that the production was more in tune with the appearance of the album rather than its contents and the song sequences do not blend into each other as well as they have in past albums. I however DO NOT recommend this album, unless you want it as part of your collection because you have all the other volumes.  I only liked 2 songs on here.  The rest was not as sophisticated as in past volumes 
 I knew that I wasn't going to like this book after 2 minutes of flipping through the photos.  They are mediocre at best.  Not one inspiring shot in the entire book!  And the advice is useless.  Skip this book and buy "The Simple Secret to Better Painting: How to Immediately Improve Your Work With the Golden Rule of Design" by Greg Albert.  And don't be fooled by the word "painting" in the title.  This is a book about composition and it will help make you a better photographer 
 Bought it. Played a DVD on it for 2 hours and the unit failed.  Other DVD players in the house have had no problems at all and have worked non-stop for years.    Save yourself time and money.  Purchase a quality item instead of this throw-away player 
  this book was dull, silly, and slightly offending. every single picture in this book was of blonde, gorgeous cheerleaders chatting up handsome white guys in track jackets. it seemed like the author had only concerns for white and beautiful people. whats more, the advice was not helpful and outdated.  
 Anybody who thinks they're writing a book about the sixty best television  shows ever made yet somehow doesn't include The Simpsons is obviously so  stupid and ignorant that no further comment need be made. Time for this  windy old hack to be sent to the glue factory 
 This was a very informative book.  I have never been in the Greek system but my son is in his first year of college.  I have a much better understanding about the reality of these social griups 
 This CD was very uninformative and provided almost no information about the topic it was supposed to address, which is meditation. The speaker is very preachy and rambles on and on about unrelated topics. Very unpleasant voice to listen to, very boring. Big waste of money 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 dont' buy this cd, it's boring, the on;y interesting song is the theme song, and really, have many times do you want to listen to that 
 It is unfortunate that Diane Stein titled her book "Essential" Reiki as there is a lot of her own innovation and syncretism with other healing and spiritual disciplines in it.  Ms. Stein was very cutting edge at the time for publishing reiki symbols and opening up what was a previously more secret practice.  However, I would recommend this only to advanced students, such as reiki master level students, as an example of how not to write a reiki manual for this reason:  Ms. Stein is a Wiccan.  I have no problem with her being a Wiccan.  I am a Christian and I hope that no one would have a problem with that.  However, I find it problematic that she blends some of her Wiccan beliefs, such as a clockwise "invoking energy" in the Northern hemisphere, into an originally Japanese practice, and therefore arbitrarily changed the direction of the first reiki 2 symbol.  If I wrote a book on reiki, since it is now confirmed that Usui-sensei was a lifelong Buddhist, I wouldn't put the Lord's Prayer into my attunement process.... I believe Reiki should be for those of all faiths.  Ms. Stein's reiki attunement methodology borrows heavily from the Raku Kei/Arthur Robertson lineage and also has some elements of William Rand's "tibetan" lineage.  Neither is acknowledged as at the time she wrote the book, she didn't know the origins of much of her material.  Additionally, since the publication of her book, there has been much discovered about reiki history and Japanese practices.    I have no issue with the book as a snapshot in time, but that she continues to sell and distribute the book over a decade later without crediting some of the sources of her material and without updating it, is problematic.  I believe a second edition should have been provided if the book was to remain in print.  As an example of someone who has changed his material, William Rand has revised his Reiki Handbook for levels one and two to include the Japanese techniques and information.  In short, what was cutting edge and creative in 1995 is no longer accurate or cutting edge and I would caution beginners to look elsewhere for a more traditional, basic introduction to reiki as "Essential Reiki" as a title is misleading.  I recommend the works of William Rand, Frank Arjava Petter, Hiroshi Doi, Frans and Bronwen Stiene, and Tanmaya Honervogt for starters 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 After really enjoying the first 3 books in this series I began to find it to be rather formulaic.  And the characters have begun to be annoying rather than charming.  Amelia is self centered, Hannah is rigid, and Grace has no spine at all.  I found myself being irritated by them instead of curious 
 I bought this one because I was looking for a very hip Christmas album.  Knowing Peter White, what else is there but hip music.  Wrong.  This wasn't Peter White at all (except for 'Jingle Bells') - or not the Peter White I've become familiar with.  It was just another 'dime-a-dozen' Christmas album... boring.   If you want some smooth jazz hip music.. look elsewhere.  If you want to sleep.. this is the baby for you.  Just try not to snore too loud 
 The book was highly recommended by Blogger, radio talk show host, author HH, unfortunately I found it lacking.  The book rehashes ten communications rules we have all heard before (use short sentences, stay on message and repeat, etc.) and it gives (glaringly obvious), examples of communication success stories ( e.g. "plop, plop, fizz, fizz"....., and "Just do it", etc.).  I'd say pass on this one.  This is the first review i have ever written, this book was that disapointing 
 Disciple is a band that, unfortunately, seems unable to find its way to the top of any audience's favorites list. Too unpolished to reach the top of the Christian rock scene and too typical to gain success in more indie-oriented circles, Disciple is perpetually cursed to mediocrity.  Admittedly, this album is a step in the right direction, seeming an improved successor both to the recent, pop-oriented self-titled album and the older, rawer releases like By God and Back Again. The beats are fast and the guitar riffs faster in songs like "Dive", "Regime Change", and "Game On". Unfortunately, the songs never seem to go much farther than that, opting for paths beaten to dust ten years ago or more rather than newer sounds.  The lyrics have enough biblical allusions to satisfy the religious audience, and the riffs have the tired feel that make this exactly the type of release that "old-school" Christian rockers will love, complete with the sleep-inducing power ballad "No End at All". However, in a scene that is increasingly developing lyrical and musical depth, Scars Remain simply can't compete--it has nothing really new to offer. 
 Who buys and listens to his stuff?!  I got this CD as a gift and must say I was very disappointed to hear that this is what America likes?  His voice sounds so average "broadway musical" and not outstanding at all. My bet is he can thank American Idol that he sells any albums at all. 
 This book is infuriatingly opinionated; and Fadiman spends a lot of energy and space insulting great writers and saying stupid things. He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them.  Many of his judgements are simply wrong 
 Leadbetter turns swinging a club into a bunch of scientific mumbo-jumbo that I cannot apply to my own game 
 David Fromkin's "Peace to End All Peace" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. Many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other.  Fromkin attempts to examine how the modern Middle East (extending as far as Afghanistan and some sections of Central Asia) was created during and after the First World War. Obviously, in order to do this, the fall of the Ottoman Empire in that war must be considered. This is where Fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. Focusing on the European political machinations to resolve the "Eastern Question" in their favour, the sorry tale becomes one more of Churchill and TE Lawrence than of the Arabs and Turks who were also involved in the process. Admittedly, it was the Europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such as the CUP Triumvirate in the dying Ottoman Empire (and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much.  Never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. A complex web of national and personal political interests in both Europe and the Middle East combined to make the region what it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. The problem that Fromkin has, however, is that he does not make these very well at all. The story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. Ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.  Additionally, Fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. Indeed, one map (showing Enver Pasha's advance on Baku and his campaigns in Central Asia) is laughable in the extreme. The legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not equilateral triagles.  Where Fromkin does well, however, is in his use of purely European sources. It is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern Middle East, but I have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the Middle Eastern aspects of the events in question. In terms of Europe, however, his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.  Ultimately, "A Peace to End All Peace" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. A diplomatic history of Europe during the Great War can be written much better than this, and a history of the development of the Middle East following that conflict already has been (the chapters in Margaret Attwood's "The Peacemakers" or William Cleveland's "Modern Middle East" both easily outshine this) 
 Even if you're a "conservative," you gotta admit that this is one of the worst magazines around. If you like good writing, don't even try this one. A "one star" is still too generous in my opinion. 
 What was once a really good band 10 years prior had turned to a hit machine. The big problem is that these songs did not stand the test of time whatsoever. If I only had one word... SAPPY. Most of this crap is so bad it makes me sick and it is not the songs. It is the production. Everything is keyboards. Gone are the signature horns that made Chicago what they are and I'm sure the guys in the band know this as well. Taking the horns out of Chicago is like taking the guitar out of Van Halen. This era in the bands carare should be forgotten for it was just an all out attempt to make money and that they did Best song - Stay the Night Worst song - Take your pic 
 This was my first Deaver book...and my last.  The suspense factor was "ok", but the sections on scuba were ridiculous.  A diver (with only 25 logged Caribbean clear-water dives) goes into a new NY/NJ wreck, alone (no dive buddy), on a single tank.  And the Coast Guard approves this dive...laughable.  Then once in the wreck, the diver goes down a dumbwaiter passageway measuring 2' by 2', without taking off any gear!!!    You might ask why I point this out...The above was 2 chapters, not just some passing reference, a very material piece of the story.  If this one section [which I know something about] is that outlandish, what does that say for the other sections that I'm not as informed about.  Complete Science Fiction!!!  You are better off reading tea leaves than this book. 
 I found this book to be disappointing. The reason may simply be because The Killer Angels is such a hard act to follow. 
 Just read the previous review (about 'simplifying' the language in Jungle Book). I am reading the ORIGINAL text JB to my eight year old son (for over a week now), and he's not once indicated that the language puzzles him.  He did ask me why Mowgli uses thee and thou and wouldst while talking with the animals, but  accepted my explanation without demur.  Reminds me of the lines from an Elinor Wylie poem "Our mutable tongue is like the sea  Curled wave and shattering thunder-fit;  Dangle in strings of sand shall he  Who smooths the ripples out of it." Say it out loud, and feel what it does to your mouth and face - that's what Kipling's prose does

 I hadn't heard of Stone Roses before, but had heard Keep What You've Got on the radio and thought it was a pretty decent track.  The DJ mentioned that Noel Gallagher produced the track, and that piqued my interest a little more.  So, I took a chance and sought the album out.   The album is shockingly bad, especially in comparision to the two good songs on it - the leadoff track, and Keep What You've Got.  The rest of the album is over-produced garbage.  It reminds me of the 80's synth-pop that was so popular (and boring) in my childhood.   Do yourself a favor and track down the single of Keep What You've Got, and maybe download the first track off iTunes - but don't waste your time or money on this pathetic album.   
 I bought this DVD for my husband for Xmas.  We loved Shaolin Soccer so much, I thought it would be a great present.  We sat down to watch it on Christmas night and it would not play, in any of our DVD players.  It was only 4.99, so it's not a huge loss, but we were really looking forward to watching it.  Save your 5 bucks 
 beware! i think this book is can not illuminate anything to anyone not trained in jungian psychology and/or who just loves to be plunged into and having to plough through 200p of very unclear pros 
 ACOP's second full length offering "prepare the masses" is anything but a "change" from the corporate faux post-hardcore trash we're subjected to on a daily basis by taking back sunday and so they say. If you're expecting something catchy, you'll be letdown. If you're expecting something heavy, you'll be letdown. If you're expecting something original...forget about it!  Aside from a small handful of radio singles, there is almost nothing memorable about "prepare the masses". It is what it is; generic post-hardcore. If you're a diehard fan of 'so they say' or 'taking back sunday' (post-tell all your friends), you may want to give this a shot. Anyone else, stay away!    
 Anyone else disappointed in this book? It seems to center on the wardrobe the most. I know it is difficult for the authors to show detailed images of the vehicles of the first trilogy, since they are all digital. But this book pales in comparison to the first Star Wars Chronicles. I can't recommend it as you can find pretty much the same material in the "Making of" EP1,2,3 books, all of which can be found for cheap.   The photographs all seemed washed out...all lacking crisp rich colors as in the first book. For the costumemaker/modelmaker/toy collector/true fanboy this book would be a great addition..I personally am not satisfied.  
 i cancelled this order as it was going to take even longer to be shipped 
 Lack of practical info, badly edited, quite a few errors. . . just a big ego trip for the author. Very disappointing 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity's two friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then 
 There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked this book up on the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there 
 I RECEIVED A CD, THE TANGO CD( THE BEST TANGO ALBUM IN THE WORLD EVER) WAS DEFECTUOUS, SINCE IT PLAYS ALRIGHT  UNTIL THE 12TH SONG, BUT THEN THE SONGS STARTS GIVING WEIRD TONES. AND THE 2ND CD ACTS THE SAME WAY, SINCE MY TANGO ALBUM IS A DOUBLE CD.THE PROBLEM IS NOT FROM THE RADIO, SINCE MY OTHER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON IS IN GOOD SHAPE, AS AL MY OTHER CDS. THE MUSIC ALWAYS STOPS PLAYING RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME OF THE CD, THE 12 TH SONG, SO ITS PRETTY MUCH A CD PROBLEM. I DUNNO WHATS THE REFUND POLICY, OR CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, ITS SO BAD , COS THIS TANGO CD IS GREAT. I ENJOYED IT MUCH , UNTIL......... TH 
 I used this about 6 times.  the first time i could barely push and pull it bcs the suction was so strong.  It became a lot easier as time went on bcs the vac does loose suction.  I'm used to Canisters and will never get an upright again.  trying to vac stairs and get the wand thingy out is very difficult. I don't think this Vac is user friendly and its definetly not worth the price.  i returned it to target 
 I have read most of the books in this series and they all suffer from the same problems. They are full of errors that could have been corrected before release if the publisher hired a proofreader. This book is especially frustrating with poor graphics, charts, and tables. You can find some corrections to the text if you search the web. Do not purchase components from the source listed in the book (they are extremely overpriced) 
 The absurdity of this movie made me laugh quite a bit. The sets were cheap, the plot (if you can call it that) was clunky, and the direction stank. A lot of people who have reviewed this already are railing on the actors, and the only reason I don't is because I have seen most of the main cast (the ones on the front cover) do very well in other roles. It is evident that they really weren't given much to work with.  If you're looking for a horror flick to laugh at and make fun of in Mystery Science Theater 3000 fashion, this would be a good one to pick up. If you're looking for good sci-fi/horror, look elsewhere 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 This is maybe the worst item that I have ever purchased in my life.  The size is totally wrong. Sock, no maybe a half of a sock may fit on the press.  I am totally displeased.  Ad totally misleading!!!!!! I would rate this product 0!!!!! 
 Although well-researched, this book is really little more than a book of quotations lifted from several primary sources. The result is rather monotonous and fails to provide the detail and context that makes those primary sources so informative. A much better idea is to simply read the memoirs written by the men who were actually there (and there are plenty of them). They provide much greater insight into the life of a German Landser than this second-hand account 
 Blue Racer: Say bug, who cares about The Bay City Rollers. Japanese Beetle: Apparently America didn't as music like Led Zeppelin, Queen, Pink Floyd and The Eagles was huge(and still looked back in great terms on) unlike these freaks Serpent Son. Blue Racer: SATURDAY NIIIGGGGGHHHT was F*CK*NG G******YYY! Japanese Beetle: You got that right, avoid or HAASAH! SAYONARA! 
 Feminist icon Angela Davis goes way out of her depth by claiming that the American women's suffrage movement itself was racist. The evidence she cites has no currency with historians of women's suffrage or of 19th century America. Her analysis of the current women's movement rests on much stronger ground. 
 they just sound like coldplay all over again. do we really need another coldplay band? they seem talented enough to defy this genre, so i'm wondering why they haven't 
 Flipping through this book can be kind of fun in very, very small doses.  You get to read about some well known classic songs, some lesser known ones, and get reminded of some you might not have though of in years and be introduced to some you may have never heard.  But boy, what an ego Marsh has, and what arrogance!  I mean think about it.  Do you really think that anybody would buy and read a book by you about YOUR favorite songs 
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 Nice going puto you set my buddy and his race back 200 years during your 15 minutes of fame 
 The only good thing which occurred when I bought this item from Amazon was it arrived with in two days.  I was quite disappointed when I opened the package only to find it was a typical pop-up hamper I could have bought anywhere in a store thus in the long run I ended up paying more for it.  I wanted to buy a pop-up hamper with a lid that you can zip it to stay closed.  This hamper lacks a lid so I reccomend if you're looking for the same thing not to buy it.  If I had known it lacked a lid I would not have purchased the hamper.  It's partially my own fault for not doing enough research about the product.  I gave it two stars because it's still functional and sturdy 
 This book is pretty much useless if you're looking for info on how to build a dulcimer.  Only about 60 pages of it actually talks about dulcimer making/repair.  The rest is a long winded history/bio of Homer Ledford.  Some of that is a bit interesting from an historical/cultural perspective, but the author beats it to death.  Homer wanted the book to be just on how to build and care for a dulcimer; the rest was the author's idea.  Dean Kimball's book on dulcimer making is better, although still lacking in some areas.  This book has no patterns or plans, few useful photos, and is weak in what instruction it does provide.  There are a few useful ideas but not worth the price of the book 
 This book should have been called "Beautiful Interior Designs that Happen to Include some Home Theater Gear", or "Home Theater Style".  It's little more than a pretty picture book of impressive-looking rooms that integrate HT gear, and often in a laughable way.  The text is fluffy, thowaway stuff that is irritating to read.  The photos are very well done, but often include speakers and other gear set up with no unsightly cables.  Of course, without the unsightly cables, there'd be no audio or video, either.  I guess that's the main thing that got to me -- if you're going to show a setup with nice speakers and other gear that are out in the room, at least be honest about how to treat cables and make them look as good as possible.  Don't just leave them out altogether.  It's insulting, and is foolish in a book that is supposedly about HT 
 Can't add much to the discussion about the movie, but wanted to say that this DVD listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of School Daze. It says it has both full screen and widescreen, but it doesnt 
 An exciting subject matter made into a boring incomplete account.  Bernard Lewis is, no doubt a Scholar of exception ability, but he has missed the boat here. He seems obessesd with only the Islamic sources concerning the Assassins. He has neglected, or choosen to leave out, much of the crusader/Mongol source material.  He trys his best to legitimise the Assassins as a real Islamic sect, rather than an pagan sect operating under the pretence of Islam.  Lewis also attempts to distance the Assassins from the Templars and Crusaders, commenting very little on the endless envoys, pacts, tribute payments,and treaties between them. Nothing on the Assassin envoy that discussed the possibilty of the the Assassins turning christian (that the Templars murdered).   The book was a painfully boring read as well 
 Having used the Owl Clip Light with success previously, chose to order through Amazon (to a secondary provider)for a gift.  The gift finally arrived, broken and unable to be used.  Also, at the same time, ordered one to keep for future gift - it has never arrived. Probably will never order through a secondary provider again 
 I just read The Divide by the author of the Horse Whisperer, and I wanted to share my opinion of the Horse Whisperer. I did not read the book; I saw the movie, a couple of years ago.  I just remember it being very hoakie, one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  I know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public, but I did not share this enthusiasm.  Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie 
 Perhaps it is a relief to discover that in 1981, Ian McEwan's writing was embarrassingly horrible. For you McEwan fans, do yourself a favor and don't read this. For you McEwan scholars, you must read it to understand that sheer brilliance can be preceded by utter incompetence.  The Comfort of Strangers is 127 pages long. To give you an idea of the young McEwan's inflated ego, the book ends with the word FINIS.   "Comfort" is the story of two bumbling English idiots who stumble their way through a story with no arc. They are two dimensional, wordless, unthinking potheads, who visit a foreign city and lay in their room all day, except for a few visits with a murderer. As you read, you can see the whole thing coming, and toward the end the book the reading becomes unbearable, because you know what's about to happen and can't bear the awful writing.    What McEwan had in mind by not directly identifying the city, making it seem like Venice, but also making it distinctly not Venice, is beyond my imagination. It adds nothing to the book. The entire story could have been 15 pages long, and better written by the worst pulp fictionist.   My final word of advice regarding "Comfort". In the event that a thug invites you, by force actually, to visit his home, and proudly displays his collection of barber's razors, it's safe to assume he's related to Sweeney Todd.  In this book we find two interesting looks forward to "Saturday", a book I admire. Here we have the powerful punch in the stomach met with no reaction beyond mild curiosity, and a poorly written crime scene. Ian, please give up trying to write violent sequences. It ain't your thing. 
 I was shocked when I saw the episodes of the second season. I would say the first season was one of the best things to be aired on TV ever. How come they just throw all that down the drain ? You really don't know what to think during the episodes. "Is it a comedy ? Oh, look at at satan and his friends having a chat.Am I supposed to laugh or amuse myself ? And now, is it a serious episode ?" Not to mention the lack of darkness so well conveyed by Frank Black in the 1st season. To sum up, the second season left a lot to be desired. The only thing I can do now is re-watch season one. 
 This was a book that i was required to read for my english lit class.  Although i didn't personally like the book, many people that i know did.  I found the subject matter very boring, partly because of my inability to relate to it.  I would only recommend this book to someone with a strong interest in South African politics 
 RC Sproul Jr. makes a compelling argument as to why Christian parents should homeschool their children.  His primary text is Deuteronomy 6 where God commands His people to teach His Law to their children.  Certainly the best place to teach, train, and raise godly children is in the home.  Parents aren't competing with  "the world" and children aren't confused by the two drastically different approaches to the way they see things and the way they are called to live.  I totally buy that.  What I do not appreciate is how simplistic Mr. Sproul Jr. can be when it comes to the "how" of homeschooling.  I understand that this is not the main focus of his book.  Certainly he is more interested in telling us why it is important.  However, I cannot sit back and accept ideas like the only textbook you really need is a Bible.  He says things along these lines over and over and over again, making his point that we need to be teaching our children the Faith and that this must be their primary curricula from which all others stem.  And yet, he downplays all other subjects as though they were an aside.  We are commanded by God to value the life of the mind and to love Him with all of our minds.  One way, perhaps even the primary way we do this is by learning and not only about the Lord.  The "how" is more than a conversation.  Yes, school is all of life.  He makes this big case for that and then stuffs in a line or two here and there that his kids do learn math and receive "formal" schooling.  I guess my biggest problem is the writing style.  Sproul rambles, like he's having a conversation with himself.  I think this leads to a lack of clarity and makes his book difficult to follow.  While his main point is the "why" of homeschooling, he often tacks on several points on the "how" that made me quite frustrated in attempting to follow his argument.  All in all, I don't really recommend this book.  I would recommend instead _Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning_ by Doug Wilson instead 
 In Piano Tuner, Daniel Mason (an American medical student who went to Myanmar to find himself), presents a clear picture of a liberal Englishman in the late 19th century, who travels to Burma to repair a piano. He apparently hated himself and his culture so much that, within weeks of arriving in exotic colonial Burma, he craves for a new identity as a Burmese. Without any hesitation, he cheats on his wife (exotic Asian women are so sexy), abandons his previous life, and rebels against the British authorities in Burma.  This genre is very old and quiet stale. Ever since Europeans "discovered" Asia, there have been books about going to the orient and finding meaning in a life that was meaningless in Europe. Daniel Mason trudges down this weary path once more one hundred years later.  Not only does he spin out an old formula, he does so with very little sophistication. In the novel, a Burmese woman accuses the English newspapers of caricaturing local women as dancing girls and men as barbarians. Mr. Mason does the same thing in his novel. There is not one Burmese male character in the novel who is intelligent or endearing, and the one Burmese female character has a fetish for European men. She can't get enough of them.  A dominant character in the book is an English doctor (Mr. Mason's fantasy alter ego?) who is a lover of the arts, a scientist and a thoroughly decent chap. This doctor is protecting the region from British aggression, studying local flora and fauna, saving lives of the Burmese with his medical ingenuity, and truly appreciating the beauty of the country.  While Mr. Mason seems to oppose the military aggression and rule that the British used in that part of the world, he openly endorses the idea of a white savior doctor who can teach the locals how to live in a civilized manner. This is so old, that it hurts me to write about it.  
 I read the works of folks like Vince Flynn, Lee Child, and, I thought, Nelson DeMille, for the escape--the action--intrigue. Someting to make the plane flight go faster.  I don't read for thinly-veiled, current-events, quasi-political commentary.  (There are recognized exports available for that sort of thing.  For example, a tour-of-duty in Vietnam gives neither me, nor Nelson, "expert" status on the conduct of warfare.)  DeMille, as he matures as a person and a writer, has taken to slipping his "agenda" into his storytelling.  Consequently, the "story telling" aspect of his craft has, in my opinion, atrophied.  He, of course, has that right. But I, for one, am done reading his books. There's always the news if I want current events commentary. And better suspense writers if I desire an entertaining escape.     
 I refuse to believe that any human being can actually believe the hateful, uninformed, and often bewildering things that Ann Coulter says in this book. So if you're thinking about buying "Godless" or any other of Ann's hate speech because you're a conservative and want to read more about conservative beliefs, keep looking. Turning to this drivel to learn more about true conservatism is like trying to become an attorney by watching a Judge Judy marathon. It's entertainment for the lowest common denominator. Ann Coulter sells books by being outrageous and spewing craziness so you'll be interested. She doesn't care about conservatives, and she doesn't share your beliefs - I don't care who you are. All she cares about is taking your money. Do us all a favor and stop padding this woman's pockets. 
 The photos in this book are very sad.  I am not sure who would want this book.  I can only imagine how upsetting an adoptive child would be to leaf through the pages. While a few children are happy, quite a few are sad, crying and have injuries or defects. 
 My CD player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above. I called the Harman Kardon customer service line, and they kept me on hold for ten minutes. Then I went to their website, which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics. The website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to Harman. I had to do that three times to get a response. Finally I got a return authorization after two days and several emails. Poor quality, poor customer support. Guess what H-K, I won't be buying any of your products in the future. This is a replacement for a Sony changer that worked flawlessly for 18 years. And, I may take HK to small claims court if the replacement doesn't work. 
 After reading five of her novels, I have become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I will admit (and this probably proves that I am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself) that I've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that didn't make it on the list.   Initially I liked the book and it kept me reading, though maybe just out of habit. I enjoyed reading about the Amish way of life and the Amish traditions - though it did make me think of that Harrison Ford movie, Witness (circa 1989 or something). I like that she used one first person voice as well as the third person narrative in a well crafted and varied way.  I like that her main character has a powerful job that challenges gender stereotypes by being the morally questionable lawyer. That being said, she doesn't explore this as well as she could. We sort of forget that Ellie has blatantly suppressed evidence and watched as little girls saw their rapist acquitted. Rape, she can defend, but infanticide creates some problems for the notorious defense attorney.   Something about the book bothered me. Maybe I am reading too many of her books too fast but I am seeing a formula here.  - Many of her plots include a court room drama.  - All of her plots feature romance or end with the obvious potential for one.  - Mothers and their powerful (all encompassing, self-sacrificing) love for their children are a theme in all of her books I've read.  - There is usually a "twist" at the end. She's becoming Koontz like in her formulaic predictability and I stopped reading his novels as a teenager.  Most of her books left me content, like I'd eaten a good, hearty meal. However, this book left me hungry and searching for critical reviews to see if others shared my dissatisfaction.   So: - I was unimpressed with the "twist" at the end of this one - I knew "whodunit" about 1/2 of the way through. I was getting bored with that part of the story. The red herrings are too obvious and her suggestions that Katie didn't do it were there from the beginning. She should've stopped the heavy handed attempt to make us question that and just made it known through the 3 person narrative exactly who did the killing or hiding. Then she could have explored that character in depth instead of hiding her and others she wanted you to be suspicious about. Just because we, the readers knew, didn't mean that Ellie had to know - or anyone else for that matter.   - The characters in this novel were a tad generic. I am sorry, I like her, but they were boring.   For instance, I was bored with Ellie's dilemma over Coop - to the point where I often skipped the interaction they had when they discussed their potential future together. Duh, I knew they were going to get together after a little drama from Ellie through which Coop - being the quintessential "sensitive ponytail guy" - would wait, albeit in pain. It was just too predictable.  Hannah's ghost; she has a ghost hunter in a later novel and I was a disappointed to see another one. But other than that, Hannah's ghost seems a bizarre and meaningless addition. Is it to suggest that she, Katie, might be crazy and a murderer? Is it to explain why she was so drawn to Adam? Katie being the good Amish girl could only fall for someone who could share her secret ability to see her sister... In a book that is so Amishly pragmatic and logical in every other way makes it so the supernatural element clashes with the rest of the novel. Maybe Hannah's ghost killed Katie's baby or hid it.  I liked the details. The Amish and their daily lives, those who assimilate and those who don't, and how the religion and way of life affect one's thinking offers a neat, un-scholarly insight into a different culture. I liked the culture clashes and I wondered how they would be resolved. But what I did like, doesn't measure against my dissatisfaction.  My most recent book purchase included three works of fiction; two by Picoult and one by Atwood. I think I'll shelve the unread Picoult for a while. I'll have some time to forget her modus operandi. I'll read the Atwood and then I'll buy a book by a different author 
 With so much great potential in this project, it's a shame it had to be so terrible.  Can you imagine if the author had talked to people who had a functional understanding of Springsteen's music, instead of just people who were like, "Yeah, I listened to him back in the eighties!  'Borrrrn in the USA!!!'"?  The author is remarkably uninteresting, and his subjects not much better.  Even the cop, commenting on "41 Shots," could have been engrossing had they picked a more interesting cop.  This one was just like, "How?  How could be betray us?"  Not even giving a moment's consideration to the real question of whether they were betrayed or whether those cops really were racists and murderers.  Would have been nice to at least touch down on that point 
 The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient "toltec" wisdom.  It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications.  Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein.  
 The first thing I didn't like about this book was the number of non-crock-pot recipes.  It's disconcerting to be reading a slow-cooker cookbook and find salad recipes.  Other books I've read give suggestions (such as, serve this with rice and a salad) but this is the first one to actually include directions for salads and rice.  If I want to make fried corn fritters I will refer to The Frequent Fryers' Cookbook and not a slow cooker book.  The second thing - and what prevented me from even attempting any of the recipes - was that I found inaccuracies in the book.  For example, the first recipe to catch my eye was "Lemon Chicken with Potatoes and Mushrooms."  Yet, when you read the recipe - there are no mushrooms!  Also, the steel-cut oats recipes suggest cooking one cup of oats for 2 servings.  My package directions and personal experience say that a cup of steel cut oats serves 4 once cooked.  These inaccuracies make me wonder what other typos are tucked away in the book.  
 A good looking, substantial item butI had to return two of these units due to uneven heating. The only KitchenAid product that I've ever had that was sub-par. For this kind of money, they should be first rate and they're not. The company was good about the returns, however 
 i hate this book i really regret reading this book spending my money and my time.i thought it was going to be good as always cz its jane green but no definitly a BG NO 
 Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You."  
 I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:  First, very little is true to the book.  That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say "That's not in the book...that's not in the book..."  Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.     I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...   A kid chasing a ticket through a train,   A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,   A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,  (Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)  OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...  A train sliding out of control on the ice,  A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,  A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the "coaster tycoon" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole.   Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...  A train car running out of control through Santa's village,  Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...  Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.  At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!    And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.  So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a "character driven" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.  I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.         
 I was reading the other reviews and wondered if I was reading the same book.  I even checked the cover to make sure.  Yep, I read the same book but didn't get the same information out of it than other people had.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if all of the other reviews were from Ryan Allis' mother, neighbors, and friends just to boost the book's credibility.  Here's the deal:  I've actually built and sold my company and didn't do it the way Ryan Allis suggested.  Not even close.  Okay, so maybe he has a different method, right?  I just don't see how it's possible to build a company the way he outlines, then to sell it?  I think that he's trying to cover way too much information in this book.  That's the first problem.  The second problem is this:  He tries to "fluff out" the book by adding extraneous information like "globalization" and why there was the "dot bomb crash" in the late 90s.  WHO CARES?  It's like he purposely adds useless information to either make himself seem more intelligent, confuse his readers, mask that he doesn't know what he's talking about or add pages to what would otherwise be a 50-page book.  Another issue I have is that he has his readers do an "opportunity recognition and evaluation" of a company that they would like to start.  Such companies he was able to "brainstorm" are making oxygen tanks so dogs and cats can go diving, flavored straws, sonar for blind people, a teddy bear with sensors and small computer inside that would talk to infants/toddlers and encourage good behavior or tell them a bedtime story (then what are parents for?), restaurants for dogs and cats and a variety of other SUPER LAME business ideas.  I have a lot of business experience under my belt and, if you are considering starting a business, here's my advice:  Don't reinvent the wheel.  Take a concept that someone else is doing very successfully, add your own twist to it, and your product or service through direct response (direct mail, Internet, etc.).  And that's it.  What's with the oxygen tanks for dogs and cats so they can go diving?  Is this guy out of his [CENSORED] mind?  I love my pets too much to subject them to something that would freak them out like underwater diving.  And doesn't he know that cats HATE THE WATER?  This is precisely why I like the book Multiple Streams of Income by Robert Allen so much.  He gives the BEST business ideas with actual step-by-step plans to go with it.  No guessing, reinventing the wheel, inventing some lame-brain product that is destined to fail, and pushing people in the wrong business direction.  If you are thinking of starting a business, don't buy this book.  If you have a business and would like to sell it, don't buy this book.  In fact, I can't think of ANY reason to buy this book 
 Hard as it is to do, this film manages to make Jet Li look very, very bad. I kept having Karate Kid flashbacks! The story is the same old, same old, American martial arts move cliches, fighting for honor and all...in a place that is obviously NOT Los Angeles. The real disappointment is that the martial artists( in come cases obviously just local students for God sake!) are sub par and the choreography suffers for it. The action sequences are slow and awkward. Pass on this one guys 
 Beneath the Remains, Sepultura's 3rd album from 1989  This album, along with Chaos A.D. and Arise, is considered to be the embodiment of Sepultura's classic era, and many fans consider this to be one of the finest, if not the finest installment in the band's catalog. With that said, this disc offers straight ahead thrash metal and little else. There are a lot of great riffs, great solos, and a lot of time changes, which will be enough to whet the appetite of many metal fans. Be that as it may, though, you should be warned that the boys really did not make an inspired effort on this record. It's basically just a slash and shred metal record with very little creativity or personality. An album like this really can't stack up against some of the greatest creative works of the genre, such as Metallica's ...And Justice For All, Iron Maiden's Powerslave, or Megadeth's Rust In Peace. I would give a track-by-track evaluation, but nothing really stands out here. I also have a gripe with Max Cavalera's vocals. I was really not pleased with what I heard from him, as his vocal style was not very well developed at this point in his career. Andreas Kisser and Cavalera sound pretty good on guitar. The standout track would probably be "Slaves of Pain." There's a great little bit around the two minute mark where Cavalera sings, "Open your eyes / Don't lose your steps / Liberty is a dream / And it also is real," then it slides into a spine chilling riff and a great solo. Drummer Igor Cavalera also turns in a pretty decent performance. This disc has something to offer, but what I've come to find is that there are some albums that really captivate you and there are some albums that you just can't get into no matter what you do. Unfortunately, Beneath the Remains fell into the latter category for me. 
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 I believed that I buyed a book of history, but it isn't. From almost the first page the book is full of personal opinions and few history.  The opinions of Anna Reid are simple, the ucranians are very good and the russians very bad,three undred and fifty years together is nothing for her, and in many parts of Ucrania the russian are new occupants - from mid XIX century (sic )- !¡. I thing that California, Texas, etc,  belongs to Mexico in the opinion of Mrs Anna Reid too, they were conquered in 1848. I know a lot of history of Russia and Ucrania, but for someone don't, the book is dangerous and worst it's not true.  When I read her, that seems to me very similar to the arguments of terrorist vasques in Spain and other minorities in Europe. I hope that Mrs Anna Reid fight for the independence of Scotland with the same strenght she do for Ucrania independence.  I'm sure that Ucrania and Russia will be togheter again in the future, but books like Borderland, cause more pain that it seem at first sight.   If you look for diferences you will find everywhere, but one country is a country because there are more thing that keep united to the people that diferences.   Definitively a bad book of history.

 I have ordered the items twice and still have not received it by now, because your shipping department have problem to provide the correct mailing address to DHL. 
 I've owned a number of Krups products, including a 17 year old steam espresso maker, and over the years have been consistently very pleased with the design, quality and reliability of the Krups products.  So I decided that it would be nice to have a new espresso maker, perhaps one that has more options and can brew more a bit faster.  After looking at the various products and the reviews of the XP4050 here on Amazon I was somewhat concerned but nevertheless ordered this machine because it appeared to be about what I was seeking.  The reviews gave me some pause but in the end I dismissed them, crediting Krups for past performance and assuming the reviewers were just incompetent or were not patient enough to learn to use the product properly.   HAH!  Boy was I wrong.  My first clue that there was something different about this item was the instruction manual.  I am able to read several languages and was amused to see that the instructions, while close, were not the same in each language.  In fact there were recipes in some languages that were missing from the English version.  What's THAT about?  Then we I tried making my first batch of espresso I found that, as others have complained, I made a mess trying to load the filter.  The next disappointment was the brew... I followed the instructions to the letter (such as they are) and the result was a pretty poor example of espresso.  The attachment for frothing/steaming the milk was not much better and also made a mess.  I put the liquids together for a latté.  Okay... I was impressed with how smooth the taste was, but the espresso itself was just plain pathetic; weak, especially compared to the output of my old machine.  So I gave it another try, this time with twice the coffee and tamping it down more and created another counter-top mess.  This time the brew was stronger, still very smooth, but only about 2/3 the quantity.   Consternation was setting in.  Then I discovered that the drip tray was FULL of liquid!?!  What the heck?  I tried every darn way I could come up with to brew a decent latté over the next couple weeks.  Alas, it was to no avail, each attempt was disappointing in some crucial aspect.  I called Krups and the very nice people suggested that if I was actually doing everything correctly then the unit must be faulty and I should send it in.  I knew that one of my attempts should have been somewhere close to the realm of doing it correctly so I doubt that there is anything faulty with my machine.  I also suspect this since my complaints echoed those I had read.  What a failure this thing is!  I am happily back to using my antique Krups unit that cost me $49, 17 years ago and the XP4050 is in route back.  Each morning I produce a wonderful, adequately strong espresso and the steamed milk is perfectly frothed.  I should have been happy with the old machine all along.  I am so sorry I doubted the other reviewers 
 It seemed like it took for ever for Carr to get around to his point. There was a lot of self promotion for a message that most of us implicitly understand. Perhaps a short essay would hav been best for this approach to stopping drinking. There are probably much more useful books out there for this difficult subject 
 I have had this textbook now for 3 years.  Sure it contains the basics, but it is now rather out of date, with a bad lay-out.  As a university student I have found it the most useless of all of the 12 marketing textbooks that I own 
 I completely agree with the reviewer who deemed this novel "overkill" with regards to the puppy mill preaching.  Those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this book and read it are already well aware of the puppy mill industry.  This choir member did not appreciate being preached at for 45 pages of a novel that would have been better spent with more plot development.  Also, I got a little weary of all the explanations of dog training and AKC show terms and slang.  Again, those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this novel already know what UDX, CDX and OFA stand for.  Readers interested enough in dogs to pick up this book but do not know what BOB stands for, what "finishing" a dog means, or what an Open class is would probably take the time to find out.  I would have preferred a Patrick O'Brian appraoch in regards to the terms and slang.  Just throw 'em out there for those of us who know, and pique the interest of those that don't.  The way it turned out, however, is that one hundred and fifty pages of a 256 page novel were all either dog show terms explained, or extolling the evils of the puppy mill industry.  I am a bit amazed that Ms. Conant does not say anything at all about the average "backyard breeder" who knows nothing of breeding dogs and wants to do it simply because his dog has papers, who do just as much damage to a breed as puppy mills, if not more.  Go figure.  I have two other Susan Conant Dog Lover's Mysteries to read, and after this first, I am a little leery of even opening the covers 
 Woods has produced a silly anti-history of the U.S. in the hopes of generating a little revenue by finding a spot on the lunatic right-wing fringe bookshelf. Among things you will learn: The Whites treated Indians just fine and talks of exploitation are overblown. Blacks in the South were a contented lot, and the whole system was ruined by racists like Abraham Lincoln and the later Radical Republicans. Woodrow Wilson led the U.S. into World War One despite America's resistance to doing so. No mention of Teddy Roosevelt and the " Preparedness " movement. Also no mention that it was Congress that overwhelmingly approved the war declaration. And wouldn't you know it? In post World War II, blacks were knocking down the walls of segregation in an avalanche, and there was no need for federal intrusion, M.L. King, or even a Civil Rights or Voting act.  Woods even briefly makes a foray into sports to show how segregation was crumbling, since Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color barrier in 1947. He neglects to include that it took more than 10 more years to have all the rest of the teams come aboard; and furthermore, neglects discussion of persistent racism in other sports. Amazingly, the author has a Ph.D. in History from Columbia! How? It had to be on some government sponsored program that he detests. This is straight out of the Anne Coulter/Michelle Malkin school of history: heavy on mudslinging; infantile with the wrting and history. 
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 I hate to say it, but this movie was AWFUL!  After seeing the first one not too long ago, I wanted to see the second one, especially when I heard about snowbabies.  Well, it was a HUGE disappointment.  If possible, it was even lower budget than the first Jack Frost film.  The plot was nonsensical, the acting even more horrible, the special effects were beyond lousy, and the quality of the film was comparable to a home camcorder.  Don't get me wrong--I am a HUGE fan of this type of film.  I love cheesy horror flicks that star a creature or some inanimate object.  But, this movie had no redeeming qualities.  I only gave it two stars because the snowbabies were almost funny.  Don't waste your time or money on this movie.  Stick with the original 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 I am not too thrilled with this cookbook.  Many of the ingredients are not items that you would have readily available in your cabinets or refrigerator.  Also, it seems like the preparation and cooking of these recipes would definitely take more than 15 minutes 
 A style over substance celebration of the drag queen mentality - if you enjoy misogynist bitchy dialogue being delivered by pantomime women, this movie is for you  Elliot's love of drag queens overshadows the rest of this flimsy, contrived and lame narrative - clealry it's about getting as many shots as possble of drag queen costumes against the outback setting  It's alleged stance against homophobia and plea of acceptance of difference is trite and cringeworthy  If anything, this film reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate queens who are not to be taken serioulsy.  Sadly it's been embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are 'camp' and therefore funny, indicative of how off the mark they are of what defines camp (go read Susan Sontag boys) and how low 'gay culture' as plummeted.  There are plentiful nasty jokes targeting female gentilia, and a secondary racist commentary about Thai women 'entrapping' Aussie men  Trashy and not in a good way. A must have for no brainer gay men.  
 This mis-titled book is probably the worst book I've ever purchased from that most respected technical publisher, O'Reilly.  I say the book is mis-titled since it weasel-words the title of "Learning PHP 5" (and all the new OOP re-write) into a few hundred pages devoted to the standard language constructs available in previous versions, and all but omits the real changes incorporated in the new version.  In fact, of the 254 pages in the chaptered part of the book only two pages even mention object oriented programming in this context, and simply recommend other O'Reilly books as reference.  I'm disappointed that O'Reilly would have let this book reach distribution 
 I ordered these, and several other movies from the Tyler Perry Collection, only to find that they were not actual movies but on-stage plays. I returned them and was charged a high restocking fee. Not OK! No where in the description was mention of them being stage plays. I will order my CD's and DVD's from another source in the future. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 First thing's first, i don't like Usher and I never did.  I wouldn't dislike him so much if he wasn't played everywhere and hailed as a god by women everywhere.  However, I do believe that everyone has the freedom to listen to whatever they want.  I'm sick of reading reviews saying that this is garbage and then telling people what they "should" listen to. It is obvious that those who listen to Usher have a certain taste in music and your petty little review isn't going to give them a revelation. An Usher fan isn't going to say, "Hmm I thought I loved Usher, but according to this unprofessional review, he sucks. Well I guess I suck. I better go listen to the Beetles or Jimi Hendrix and Metallica (thanks Kramer). These guys don't seem to be part of the genre of music I'm in to but as long as some guy says to listen to it, I'm sold".  Face it, every generation has its own popular music that is despised by its prior generation. Of course, I'm not saying that everyone from my generation likes this music (I've already established that I don't). Also, Usher is R&B, NOT RAP! And he has nothing to do with Eminem. Half of you negative reviewers saying he is rap just revealed how clueless you really are!  I find Usher's voice too high, its freakishly high and it digs up horrible memories of boy bands. Personally, I dislike every song on this album, but on the other hand I don't enjoy R&B. Everyone has different musical tastes. Girls love him and they are really the target audience because they think he's the hottest thing since jalapeno peppers (though I do not recommend basing your musical taste on how the artist looks). Usher is definitely for tweens and popular girls. If you want to give 'Confessions' a negative review, give it a negative review based on what you think of the album, don't diss the entire music industry of this decade based on one man.  If you agree that people have the right to choose what music they listen to, then vote yes. If you're one of those pricks who think that your music is the ONLY music, then vote no, it doesn't bother me, it just helps me to keep track 
 This is a very strange book: it isn't a book of philosophy and it isn't a book for practice on Personal Time Management.  If you are a CEO or a Vice president you could find something useful (but we hope you've a philosophycal background far more interesting than this book suggests..) but if you're a down on the earth worker .... forget it! When your chief demands the impossible ... explain her/him that  you're a value oriented people and .... find yourself ... fired in 2 seconds!!!  
 I really don't mean to sound judgmental but this was the very worst book I have ever read.  I mean even Nancy Drew books have more of a mystery than this one did.    I have always heard good things about the Jesse Stone Novels.  This was the first and only one I will read.  I don't know if the grammatical errors were the author's fault or the editor's.  Even the dialogue between characters didn't even have complete sentences.  Very poor sentence structure.  I agree with C. Richard's review..."Distracting" in that there are terrible grammar errors throughout this entire book and was hard to focus.  Ths story was contrite and very easy to figure out way before the end of the book who the culprit was.  This is the only review I have given that has been a poor one.  
 I highly suggest anyone who wishes to believe the information in this book examine her sources of evidence, statistical studies, clinical trials,  and objective studies.  As with most critics of stimulant therapy in ADD patients, evidence is secondary concern 
 Let's get a few things straight. I am a Randy Rogers fan. In fact, a BIG Randy Rogers fan. I was also, at one time, a huge Radney Foster fan, even going so far as to proclaim his albums "See What You Want To See" and "Another Way To Go" (as well as "Texas in 1880" with Pat Green) as some of the best country music ever made. That's a statement I don't make lightly, and I stand by it. I would also include Randy Rogers' albums in that same company. Now before you go all half-cocked telling me that I shouldn't compare an artist's previous work to their new stuff, and that I need to get with the program, let me say that I normally would agree with you. I made every effort to get into "Just A Matter of Time" on its own terms. But the problem here is that "Just A Matter of Time" isn't a Randy Rogers album at all. It isn't even a Randy Rogers BAND album. It is, in fact, a cruel and embarrassing force-feed of everything that Radney Foster wants Randy Rogers to be, right down to vocal inflections, cheesy choruses, and some of the worst and most cliched lyrics imaginable. It is an outright shame that this album should have ever seen the light of day, and I have an awful feeling that we may never see the potential Randy Rogers once had as one of the brightest stars in Texas country.   This isn't the first time a producer has wreaked havoc on an artist's sound, drowning it in their own vision so much that the artist himself becomes a parrot of the producer's ideas and sound. Listening to some of Nickel Creek's albums, for example, you hear so much of Alison Krauss' style and influence that Nickel Creek themselves almost disappear. This is the case with "Just A Matter of Time" in a major, major way. There is so much evidence of Radney Foster's recent love-affair with bland, schmaltzy contemporary adult-pop cheese that there isn't really anything specifically Randy Rogers about the album at all.   The song that will no doubt be singled out as evidence of this trend is "Kiss Me In The Dark", which is the absolute worst song in Randy Rogers' entire career, and for reasons that may have very little to do with him. I defy anyone to listen to the vocal parts and the bridge and tell me that you're not listening to something from a Radney Foster album. It almost sounds like Rogers is consciously trying to IMITATE Radney Foster's style. In fact, when Rogers isn't singing, I can almost see Foster sitting there salivating in the control booth to get on the mike. And how about the discouraging similarity between "You Could've Left Me" and Foster's "Tired Of Pretending"? Then there's the title track, a song that sounds peeled from Foster's catalog of oversentimentalized acoustic balladeering. By the time we get to "You Don't Know Me", the closest approximation of anything Randy Rogers-like on the album, you can almost sense that Foster would've vetoed the placement of this song on the album at all, instead opting for a (possibly his own) sapply love ballad in its place. Even when these guys act like they're kicking out the jams, such as with "You Could Change My Mind", they sound uninspired and bland, like a third-rate battle-of-the-bands contestant at the Potter County Fair. Such a shame.  And to read these lyrics is to turn red with embarrassment. Let's just say that the greater problem with Foster's influence on Rogers when it comes to lyrics lies in an album called "This World We Live In" which came out last year, and demonstrated a massive and sad step backward for Radney Foster's songwriting. Every single lyric on that album is sickly sweet and cliched, like an explosion in a Hallmark Card factory, right down to the meaningless album title. Well, the same is true for Roger's latest, and it's obvious who's to blame. The titles of the songs, the album title, the trite choruses, everything is almost interchangeably bland and silly. It doesn't even matter what song these cliches come from, because they could be from any one of them: "girl, we don't even have to pretend"; "why can't I make up my mind"; "would you steal my heart again and set me free"; "hit me with your heart"; "you're gonna see it your way, I'm gonna see it mine"; and my absolute favorite, "till the morning light". Folks, to hear a guy who once brought me to TEARS with his songs "Can't Slow Down" and "They Call It The Hill Country" reduced to singing stuff like this makes me so disappointed that it's a wonder I can even restrain myself from sending the damn thing back.   What a sad, disappointing tragedy this album is. Some folks are gonna call it a sellout, that's fine. Some people are gonna LOVE it, and that's okay too, since he deserves success, and I'm happy for him. But as for me, you can count me out. It was bad enough seeing Radney Foster disintegrate into the Barry Manilow of Texas country last year, but now he has to take Randy Rogers with him, and I ain't liking it. Not one bit 
 Lester Bangs is enormously over-rated. Perhaps among rock critics he was above average, but as a writer he was a hack. His style is one of the most annoying I've ever encountered. The funny thing is, I wrote just like Bangs when I was 14 -- and that's not bragging. Rather, it suggests that Bangs wrote like a whiny, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, neurotic, self-satisfied, egotistical 14-year old who neve grew up. The style is a sort of uninhibited stream-of-consciousness which becomes tiring very quickly. Plus, it's not very funny.   On the other hand, I did appreciate the historical aspect of some of the articles, particularly the perspective they provide on early punk. Ultimately, however, there is, as they say, as little point in reading about music as in tap-dancing about painting 
 Crap.  Doesn't work.  Wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period.  Plastic junk, never did get a good signal.  The worst Sony item I've ever purchased -- and I'm a Sony fan.  Will still attempt to return somehow.  Don't even bother 
 ... until two thirds of the way through it limps on withouit a credible resolution and turns in to a cross between Star Trek, Dead Ringers and The Invisible Man. With a better 3rd act this could have been great. The guy can write 
 These compression shorts are nothing like the other pair of hind I have.  Aside from the low grade material and poor stiching, the waist band rides up around my chest!  It looks like they were designed for someone 7 feet tall 
 I have heard this young man sing on several occasions.  Frankly, short of catching a scathing case of the shingles there is nothing I would rather do than curl up with my favorite Buble' recording and weep openly for the state of music to come.  This young man is a weak comparison to Paul Anka much less Sinatra.  His cardboard arrangements,nescient lyrics, and those special nasal utterings, appealing only to beagles and Otolaryngologists are at the very least, annoying.  People, are we this desperate for another Johnny Ray? Suffice it to say Johnny Ray might be the only person truly suited for a Michael Buble' recording.  Move past this pretentious flash in the pan and search for muscial talent elsewhere. Nothing to hear here 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 I bought this book before going to amsterdam for the first time and was totally disappointed whenever I followed it's advice. In fact it is simply surprizing how bad the restaurant selection was. They should be called places to avoid. Amsterdam is full neat stuff. My advice find hotel online, buy a ticket and just go. Reading this travle guide is just wasting your time 
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being "Blind."  One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  That was not this book.  At first, I thought it was just me.  Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book.  But I found it too new age for me.  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.    Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.  But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one 
 I originally wrote a relatively favorable review for this book because it seemed to incorporate the best of the original Butler's Lives (a focus on meditating on the life of the saint) and the new calendar of saints (including many recent canonizations).  While it does do the second, I am afraid to say that it is woefully inadequate regarding the first.  In fact, it is probably just as bad as the Atwater/Thurston edition.  For instance, here is part of the section from January 27th on St. Angela Merici: "Accounts of her [St. Angela Merici's] childhood make her pious, rebelling against the fashions of the age, devoted to the legend of St. Ursula, and the recipient of a vision showing a great company of virgins and other saints coming down from heaven to her.  They included a dead sister, who invited her to form a great 'Company of Virgins,' which was what Angela had actually done by the time the account was written."  In other words, the author wants to point out that the story "must" not be true because it wasn't written down until after the alleged vision had been fulfilled.  Now, we are certainly not bound to believe all the accounts in the various lives of the saints, but I do not understand the point of drawing attention to the alleged falsity of a tale in the context of a meditative reading.  If the work seeks to be encyclopedic, it is much too short and you should check on the 12-vol. counterpart, but for a daily meditation (which it seems reasonable to assume such a work is designed to be), such statements are misplaced.  If the story is too absurd to be believed, just don't include it.  As a result, it is disappointing because it would be useful to have a modern Butler's that can be used for a daily devotional or meditation.  Instead, we are left with the old works that do not match the current calendar 
 Some decent stuff, but he barely mentions ETFs, which are becoming a bigger piece of the asset puzzle. And his cavalier negativity of index funds (also mentioned in his prior books) is incorrect.  He needs to read the Arnott study in the Journal of Portfolio Management (26, no. 4, 2000). However, his points on diversification and rebalancing are on target 
 In my opinion:  I own a ton of Panasonic equipment, most recently a DVD recorder. I was using Sony DVD-Rs with no problems, but, being a Panasonic person, I figured Panasonic must be better.   In order to save a few bucks, I joined the Panasonic Club at the Panasonic website, and ordered a spindle of these same type DVD-Rs. I did this on 9/20/06.   I made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were, and, believe it or not, nobody at Panasonic could tell me why they hadn't been shipped. Then, I was promised that they did ship, but I never got them. After being talked into placing a duplicate order by a Panasonic Rep, I didn't get that order either.   I finally received one order on 10/16/06. They were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken. Now, I finally had my discs. Guess what? They were only 1-8x speed (the Sony discs were 1-16x speed), and my thermal label printer wouldn't print on them because of the finish. I had been assured that I could print on them with a thermal printer.   I did burn a couple of movies, and they worked, but I saw nothing special that I can report.   It gets worse: I logged into my Panasonic Club account, and saw two charges I hadn't made: one for $10,017 and one for $915. I fell off the back of my chair. To this day nobody has called me, but I managed to get some email responses, and I was told I would have to watch my credit card - that's just what I need!   You know, sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a Company it is, and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were.   I'm going back to Sony, and let me tell you, Amazon Customer Service blows away just about every company I've dealt with (sorry about the preposition). I should have bought on Amazon.     
 Unless you have to read everything Faulkner wrote, save your time here.  It's better than Soldier's Pay, Mosquitoes, and Sanctuary, but that isn't much to aspire to.  Here and there an interesting thought comes up, but if you're short on time or energy, spend it working through Absalom, Absalom!  That will save your soul.  You can listen to Jagger sing Parachute Woman and get the same material  in a better medium.  Pylon, however, is a good word 
 I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it 
 Sony should be ashamed for infecting PCs in which this CD is played.  Amazon should stop selling this CD immediately given the known damage that is causes to computers 
 Crashed the system every time I tried to use it...   gave me such a headache I tossed it in the trash... 
 Having loved Jennings' previous book, Straight Talk on Decorating, I plunged into this one with cries of glee... and quickly hit bottom in the dry pool. Ouch! I'd swear some of the photos of Jennings' own houses appeared in the other book, and there are far too many pages that consist only of a brief pull-quote in the Alexandra Stoddard "love yourself -- spend more on high-end housewares!" style.  The real disappointment, however, is the before-and-after case studies. All of these people have basically the same furniture: three bulky sofas, two bulky chairs, a gargantuan entertainment unit, and some matching tables. Move the sofas away from the wall, balance the entertainment unit with the largest focal point in the room, accessorize, accessorize, accessorize! And voila! The room looks just like a spread in a Better Homes & Garden decorating book, right down to the "flea market finds" that are conveniently available at a Marshall's or TJ Maxx near you. There is not one single funky, individual, or even mildly interesting room in the lot.  Why do I go as high as two stars? Before-and-after photos are always worth a star. But if you want to see rooms rearranged, Lauri Ward's Use What You Have Decorating is a more useful book with more interesting layouts 
 Instead of hangers to hold this up they use velcro. This puts strain at the top and eventually cracks the thin peice of wood holding it straight. Great for holding air, not great for holding items 
 Nothing on the end of Voyager's Delta Quadrant wanderings?  Nothing on Enterprise's backstory additions and newly-created anachronisms?  Both this book and the related Star Trek Chronology need serious revamping.  I appreciate the Okuda's insider Trekker style, but this reeks of willful blindness 
 Lots of stilted pseudo-intellectual dialogue.  A pseudo existentialist hero. A painfully ideological lecture against the death penalty.  Stilted performances by brilliant actors.  A receipe for disaster.  Why this film was a hit, I have no idea 
 After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house.  Aha, I thought, the story begins.  But alas, not much happens.  Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be.  Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no.   Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them.  The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous.  I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one.  Where was the editor on this one?  It was a bummer.  Virgini 
    Another anxiety-driven media clown with nothing remotely clever to say.  Save your money. 
 Behind this book is a great concept - do a culinary tour of China, write up your experiences, and include 100 authentic recipes gathered on the road. And so I bought it with great anticipation. Well, the result has things to commend it, and I want to like it. But there are just two things preventing me from liking it a lot more, one annoying, the other, odious.   The author, Francine Halvorsen travels to a handful of cities (she does not venture into the countryside) and meets with mainly professional catering-type people. We do learn some interesting things about the cuisine, but if you expect a colourful portrait of how people cook and eat in China, you won't find it here.  So what is annoying about the book? The present tense, mock diary-style, used by the author. Bad choice. Perhaps a magazine article in the present tense would be OK, but in my experience it takes a very fine writer to pull this off book-length. Now the odious: Halvorsen could have journeyed the Silk Road, instead she followed the Sheraton Circuit. It appears the author's tour was sponsored by China Airlines and the Sheraton Hotel group. That's fine if you want to go that route; maybe. But please have some subtlety about it! Pages of blatant advertorial on the splendours of airline food, and endless interviews with Sheraton managers and chefs damage Halvoren's credibility.   There is a useful glossary of terms in English and Hanyu Pinyin, though some may be of dubious accuracy. The author has done sufficient research, but is let down by the quickie feel of the actual trip and the sloppy work at the back of the book 
 I have an abiding interest in homes on the sea. I've ordered a batch of them. When I saw this book, I assumed that it was a book about a variety of seaside homes of varying architectural styles. I was disappointed to find that it was a book about a single community in Florida, most of the homes being done in an architecturally consistent style. If you're looking for a book of relatively contemporary homes in Florida, this might be of interest to you, as it's well done from that perspective. Otherwise, I'd look at the other available titles, many of which are quite beautifully done 
 No one will appreciate this review because I am sixteen and had to read this book for my english class over the summer. The diary entries are kind of interesting, but the analysis just KILLS my desire to read this book. I mean, as far as educational purposes go, couldn't they just put the diary in a book and let the students analyse it themselves? If you're into this kinda book, then disregard this review, but if you're sixteen and assigned this, beware. I probably wont even finish it before school starts 
 My 7 year old got this for Christmas this year.  I put it together, got every thing loaded.  She was right on top of me...couldn't wait....anxiously waiting...are you done yet are you done yet....everything was set to go....she turns the crank...out comes a couple stickers....She looks up at me..."ehhh is that it?"   we put it back in the box and now it goes to Goodwill.    My daughter said...I have lots of stickers that aren't so much trouble 
 In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create. What the film ends up doing is the one thing it must avoid at all cost in order to be effective: NOT to choose sides.  The Catholic Croats and the Muslims are the "victims," while the Orthodox Serbs are wholly to blame...  That is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a "noble cause."  There is a term used in such situations and it's called... propaganda! A more balanced and objective approach (i.e. there are no good guys and bad guys in such conflicts) with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore, more successful. The ultimate goal is good, but the method used is not necessarily the correct one. Another setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it); that is to say that the cast are badly in need of acting lessons (with the exception of Woody Harrelson)!  The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...  School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad... Yet another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame. In conclusion, the potential for a good movie was there if only the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really...   
 I'm not a member of Douglas' target audience.  That much is obvious as soon as the book opens.  Nevertheless, I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.  I don't consider myself to be a sexist, though I wouldn't label myself a feminist, either.  I'm sympathetic to some of the goals of the feminist movement: equal pay for equal work; non-discrimination in employment; basically, equal rights across the board.  What Douglas advocates in her book, however, is not equal rights.  It is special rights, and I believe that women like Douglas are the reason the feminist movement often gets such a bad rap.  Government-funded child care, taxpayer-supported abortions, national health insurance, Social Security for homemakers, and many other socialist policies are proposed as solutions to what were predominantly cultural issues, not legal impediments to equality (though I'm not denying that they existed, and still exist in some cases today).  She often uses her book to make ad hominem attacks against anyone further right on the political spectrum than Ted Kennedy, at one point calling Walt Disney a "right-wing reactionary" for his support of Barry Goldwater in 1964.  She further declares that Richard Nixon's election in 1968 convinced her that "America was not a democracy at all" and that "the status quo was inhumane and monstrous."  She uses her book as a forum to protest the Vietnam war, lend support to black radicalism, and basically do anything she can to distract attention from the fact that the feminist movement was extremely radical and that perhaps the ERA went down to defeat because people truly did understand what was at stake and chose to reject it.  As for the main subject matter of this book, any movie, TV show, or song which did not depict women getting the best of men had deleterious effects on the female psyche and made her feel worthless as a person.  The most absurd moment, for me, came when Douglas felt the need to refer to all sorts of phallic symbols in various westerns.  I'm sorry if it offends her, but the cowboys' "shiny metal oblongs" were not designed to oppress women, they were designed to shoot small oblongs at other cowboys with oblongs.  It's one thing to see a sexist message in I Dream of Jeannie; it's quite something else to be pig-headed for its own sake.  Douglas' failure to remain objective makes this book an unenjoyable read for anyone whose politics are not those of the extreme left.  .. 
 The product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided.  Much smaller than anticipated, I can only fit a tablespoon in it 
 I liked the world that was portrayed in this book a lot, and I thought that it was done pretty well.  But I have to say that some parts of the book just didn't make sense to me, and bits and pieces of the plot and the characters seemed to morph unexpectedly.  People would remember certain parts of conversations, and not other, critical parts, which confused me to no end.  I wasn't sure if it was a mistake, or if the characters were supposed to actually have forgotten.  I also was disappointed by the lack of depth in the story overall - the setting was really rich, but the characters and the plot were pretty predictable and I saw every twist coming way ahead of time - so much so that I thought the author must be setting me up to be shocked, but the shock never came.  I did enjoy the book, and will read the next two, but I'm hoping that the following books will be more creative in terms of plot and that the characters will become more easy to relate to and like 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
 I was extremely disappointed as I was expecting useful information above and beyond the respective web page's information.  This short, brochure-like book, contains nothing that a person of minimal intelligence  doesn't already know.  While I love the concept, this book, in my opinion,  contributes nothing to the desired results - letters to our children 
 I read half the book and kept falling asleep as I was reading.  The book struck me as naive, tending toward Pollyanna. Excuse me, all you admirers of this book, but this is honestly how I felt about it.  I find life to be so much more complex than his thesis seems to propose - not that there isn't some truth to what he says.  I like what Alfred North Whitehead said, "Morality.... is what the majority then and there happen to like and immorality is what they dislike". The Dalai Lama seems to say it is absolute, but I see it as relative.  
 First off, the band sucks. Why don't they and every other member and listener of theiro movement make their music a reality and hang themselves from the balcony of their three story houses and end it. I've had enough of these pu**ies pictures being plasterd all over mtv. All of these bands are little snobby rich kids who are hell bent on convincing the world that them and their f*ggish hair and jeans and make up have it so damn bad. The worse part is record producers are buying into it and squeezing as many singles as they can out of these crappy bands. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!!! 
 I expected so much more from this movie, I guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors (Jolie & Washington) and also had the always on point Queen Latifah as well.  I watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie, but I walked away bitter with shattered expectations.  First off I will say that Latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason I smiled on occasion during this movie experience.  Washington and Jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable (especially Washington who really strained in this role) that I was constantly asking myself "do I really like these two?" and I had to remind myself of movies like 'Gia' and 'Training Day' to answer with a resounding "YES!"  The film follows a rookie cop (Jolie) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop Lincoln (Washington) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called 'The Bone Collector'.  The ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer, while not who you'd pinpoint, is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever.  It's like "oh so he/she did it...interesting"...and I'm bored.  I'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling 
 I bought this book for the cute patterns and sat down yesterday to make the "mesh hat" in this book. There are many errors and typos in this pattern.  I am a very experienced crocheter and was able to compensate for the typos and steps that are entirely omitted in the instructions. I am not going to waste my time on any of the other patterns in this book and don't recommend that others buy the book to begin with. 
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 I was looking forward to hearing this CD after everything I had read and heard about the production, but I found it a major disappointment. The premise of a fusty old show queen liking a show this bad just didn't work for me. The songs are more TV jingle-like than anything that recalls music from the Roaring '20s. I gave up trying to wade through the synopsis to figure out why Sutton Foster is singing that dull--and LONG!--song about the monkey. Cute is not a substitute for witty--the writers of this show must not know that. Don't waste your money on this one 
 I had never read anything by Roth and when I finally got around to him I made the mistake of picking The Plot Against America. I enjoy "what if" books and found the idea compelling... unfortunately the book is not. It doesn't dare enough in imagining an alternative (and frightening) scenario, it fails at creating suspence and pathos at almost every turn, and it's a slow and disjointed yawn of a book. Characters are mostly very flat and the there are pages and pages of truly useless page fillers... I can't imagine why i would ever want to pick up another book of his.   You need to be a genius to act so poorly on such a good idea for a story. 
 I specifically waited to buy this on DVD hoping to get a Todd-AO version and not just the Cinemascope version.  The freaking Laserdisc looks better than this!  I, for one, will not be buying any more "special editions" without reading the reviews in Amazon or elsewhere when it comes to 20th Century ripoff.  This release reminds me of all the 20Th Laserdiscs that were first released when laser was just starting out and how poorly the transfers were treated...now it seems we're right back to the good old bad transfer days of yore.  Yuk, I recommend that no one buy ANY of their discs (especially the upcoming crappy versions of STAR WARS non-anamorphic, non-5.1 sound original movies).  These people suck big time! t 
 I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes. My nutritionist basically told me to watch my carbs, but dont limit my fat/salt/etc at this time. I bought this along with a Betty Crocker Diabetic Cookbook Everyday Meals Easy as 1-2-3. I am glad I bought the other one. It has pictures and is much easier to navigate. In my case the New Diabetic cookbook spends too much time on diabetes information and isn't as appealing for meals. Great for someone else, just not me 
 If you're a real Sherlock Holmes fan, this is not the movie you want to see! It's pretty dumb and not worth watching again 
 I read the reviews for this mix album and it seemed like i couldnt be getting a better cd but i was pretty dissapointed. I liked the Cosmos cd and some previous G.Communication but this mix isnt what i expected. It starts out promising but quickly changes with a selection of pretty shameful hip hop. I am a big hip hop fan and the stuff on here doesnt do the mix any favours. I also thought the change of tempos was a bit jumpy and it just never seems to go anywhere. I was waiting for some good tech house to kick in but it is all a bit 'bar friendly' if you know what i mean. If you are looking for good Fabriclive compilations i'd go for.....Freestylers, Plump Djs, James Lavelle and Aim. This one just didnt impres 
 I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work.  Yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one. 
 Pigs at the Trough brings up all kinds of problems that present serious complications to American democracy and to the honest running of the market system - corporate corruption, conflicts of interests, tight connections between business and politicians, the lack of a tie between executive compensation and company performance, the malfeasance of the big four accounting companies.  Unfortunately, rather than analyzing these problems in a serious manner, she has written a harangue, full of name-calling, insults, and anger.  She seems to hope that inciting a listener's outrage will inspire action.  In this sense, she seems to have underestimated her audience - as though she'd lose their attention if she toned down her arguments and delved into the substance.  The audio CD was read in a breathless and sarcastic manner, which quickly became tiresome.       Everyone seems to be evil in her opinion - from politicians to lobbyists to corporate executives to pharmaceutical companies to mutual funds - the big and rich against the rest of us.  The suggested solutions, which take up a small section near the end, focus on what should be done, without little depth on who should take the steps and how this can be made to happen.    The benefit of the book is the bringing to light of issues that affect many Americans but are not often discussed in depth in the general media.  One can hope that someone else will pick up where Huffington started and provide a more sober analysis. 
 I loved the concept of the markers. However they have left a greasy stain on my daughters clothing!! The package said that they didn't stain! I called and they gave me a long process to try and remove including Tide with Bleach..Is that one of their subsidiaries? I was very disappointed 
 Boy! I like the series, even though there is not much of a story - but the english translation is the worst I have heard in a long time! The translator must have been realy in a bad moode when he did write the script - so much slang from nearly every character is way to much.. 
 This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting.  I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying 
 In a word this movie was disappointing. It's supposed to be about beautiful Spaniards having sex on a magnificent Mediterranean island. Well there wasn't that much sex and the photography was nothing special. Add that to a plodding pace and poor plot and you don't get a very good fil 
 The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book.  It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 The only truth he told was in the front of the original (1830) ed of the Book of Mormon. He lists himself (correctly) as the author and proprietor of the work. Later editions claim his as a translator -- just like he translated the Kinderhook plates.  This "most correct book" contains numerous spelling errors and grammatical errors. Elohim's spell checker must have been off line when Joe was writing this one 
 I have been doing a lot of reading on Welles for a research project and while it is clear that Welles was no angel, this book seems to go out of its way to put Welles in the worst possible light.  There are too many flights of fancy and liberties taken.  For example, based on no evidence Thomson suggests that not only did Welles have sexual relations with Dorothy Commingore but that he practically raped her.  Perhaps the book reveals more about the author than it does about its subject.  There are some useful takes  on lesser known figures like John Toland but on the whole it is a book to take with several grains of salt 
 I really did not find this book enjoyable, in fact I gave up half-way through.  It was more confusing than funny and I could not feel any sympathy for the characters.  It was just a bunch of caricatures  idiotically fumbling their way through a meaningless life... The humor was  so far-fetched, and sometimes just too obvious, that the book never even  extracted a chuckle out of me.  I could see how some people might enjoy it,  it did have a lot of extravagance, arrogance and simple lunacy in it... but  it did not work for me 
 There is a hint that Jessica has a good voice, but apparently she is not sure where she belongs.  Some of the songs have a southern Gospel feel, and I must confess, that personally, I do not like that wailing type of music.  But, if you do, you will like SOME of the tracks.  However, on other tracks, she uses this breathy quality, that I suppose, is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer.  These two styles do not work well together.  Except for die-hard Jessica fans, this is not a particularly good album.  It is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as Christmas music.  At times I am reminded of Marilyn Monroe singing "Happy Birthday, Mr. President."  The problem is that Marilyn was NOT known as a singer.  Jessica needs to rethink her presentation.  Only buy this album if you think Jessica is the greatest thing since Edison invented the light bulb. 
 This text is one of the worst in terms of technical merit and correctness.  The author obviously does not have much of an idea about statistics and how to implement SPC... 
 It is so sad to me that the last several of the once intertaining Cat Who books have really been terrible.  I'm now on the lookout for another "series" to enjoy, and I'll only buy another Cat Who book at the dollar store 
 By setting her story in Manhattan, among the literary elite, Claire Messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities," which described upper-class life in Manhattan among the Wall Street elite, so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book ("master of the universe" and "social skeleton") became part of our vocabulary.   Claire Messud is no Tom Wolfe. "The Emperor's Children" describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of "The Emperor," a famous writer.  Unlike "Bonfire of the Vanities," this book has no compelling narrative - the "voice" shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want, who they need and who they love or hate and why.  Trust me, you won't care.  Meanwhile, the "Emperor" lopes along as a literary lion past his prime.  The characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals (the "Emperor" betrays his wife with his daughter's best friend, the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the "Emperor" etc. etc.) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on September 11, 2001.  But we never learn how September 11 affected Messud's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere.     
 Neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well.  It takes forever  to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount.  Perhaps the blades that crunch the S&P are not sharp enough?  Very disappointed in product 
 There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD 
 A professor highly recommended this book to my art history class. I  was disappointed in it. I had hoped it would offer some useful advice but instead it merely outlines the things anyone writing on a college level (and the book seems to be aimed at college students) should already know. Perhaps it would be better suited to high schoolers 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 When i saw the cover of this book i thought this would be a great book. I wanted to find pictures of beautiful decorated houses,nice gardens and offcourse the habitants of the mansions. Well, that's not quite what's inside this book. For the most only pictures of houses taken in the 50's and 60's and a lot of text!! I want pictures of Aerin Lauder and the Miller sisters! 
 Old movies are great.  I've been waiting for the release of Oklahoma! in the new technology DVD format - I wanted to use my new DVD up-converter.  I have the Laser Disk version, and after reading the reviews, I will keep it until Fox gets its act totether.  Fox should have a press release when they fix the problems reviewed here - until I know it's AT LEAST as good as my outdated Laser Disk, I'll wait 
 I highly recomend NOT reading this book. It is more fluff than real substance. If you are seriously looking for good sound research on the importance of environmental conservation look someplace else. 
 Once again we have a PhD wandering out into the business world without a  clue as to what real life business problems and solutions are all about.   The author needs to take a crash course in what "quality" and  "increased productivity" are all about.  The book really lacks in  areas of developing employee skills, loyalty, and taking a  "ownership" attitude 
 The Selection was great, the book was put together very well.   BUT Not one review talked about this so I'm assuming not to many people have listened to these disks closely on a good set of headphones. there is not one single track that does not reek of distortion. I find it very hard to believe that the first generation or even the second generation tapes would be this bad. I have heard Bootlegs which were taken fron albums sound far better than these. I know I have heard better masters for the Kinks, Sound Orchestral and The Ivy League. What happened? Fans have been waiting for these for a very long time and this is the best ABKCO could do. For those who want to know how bad. Take a 45 RPM only cheap record player from the 60's with a penny on the tone arm so it won't skip, take a worn out 45 turn up the volume all the way and you got it. All that's missing is the scratches 
 This magazine is less than 100 pages long and only five (5) pages are devoted to text describing how to date photos. While there is some useful information, it is too little. The rest of the pages are just old photos that are grouped by era, with no annotations to help you determine how the photo is dated. If you really want to know how to date photos as the title suggests, try a different book 
 I winced on almost every page of Phayer's book. Historians are paid, presumably, to help us understand well......history,  the perceptions, motivations and issues at play in a prior era. Historical analysis, synthesis and judgments should say something to us about the actual conditions people lived and experienced  -- in doing so an historian is even better positioned to pass the moral judgments Phayer is so addicted to.    In Phayer's book we have no such thing but instead an overblown thesis that Pius XII can only be understood as obsessed with anti-communism and his role as peacemaker. Phayer arrives at his negative judgment on Pius XII largely by anachronism in his analysis, and selectivity and bias in his use (and lack of use) of key references. Considering all the ink that has been spilt over Pius XII, his detractors no longer deserve a pass when they fail to even mention now well documented and thoroughly vetted evidence that disproves parts of the Pius-the-bad-guy thesis. Almost every page is loaded with these errors.   One example will have to suffice. Phayer condemns Pius XII's 1942 Christmas message as weak and ineffectual, "...no one, certainly not the Germans, took it as a protest against their slaughter of the Jews."  Contrast Phayer's assessment to that of a German government report which described the pope's 1942 speech as, "...one long attack on everything we stand for, HERE HE IS CLEARLY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE JEWS [emphasis added] and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals."   There are plenty of other references to the contemporary impact of Pius' 1942 speech, to include the German ambassador, the New York Times and Mussolini's government.  None of that matters to writers like Phayer and his ilk, they are, it must finally be said lousy historians ---- using anachronistic reasoning and blithely ignoring or otherwise suborning evidence that does not meet their prejudiced preconceptions. They are hardly writing history at all, but are themselves mouthpieces for anti-catholicism.   The end result of their endeavors though is transferring blame for the holocaust away from its perpetrators and exploiting the deaths of millions for their personal prejudices.        
 After hearing so much about the book, I must admit to a disappointment in its contents.  As a Belgian that has immigrated to the USA, I am well familiar with the many contrasts between Europe and the US and found Mr. Reid's observations to be lacking both in perspective and completeness.  For example, Mr Reid appears enamored with the European welfare state, vaunts its many virtues and describes it as a central pillar of the new "European identity" that is superior to the barbarous American model, but admits in small print in its Appendix that the European welfare state faces a crisis that far surpasses the US social security system in magnitude and will not survive in its present form.  I felt that a fair discussion on the topic should have included a discussion on the countless challenges to the welfare state.  I thought that many of his other observations lacked the same kind of roundness.  I felt that the book lack depths and was primarily suitable to a reader in search of a caricature on the relationship between Europe and America. 
 I found that tying in human traits to different styles of architecture was not interesting at all. There is no discussion of building techniques or the practical side of architecture.  This would be more for the artist that is trying to project different human feelings into the structure.  If you are looking for a techincal guide to architecture this is not it 
 It is shocking how poorly written and uninformative this book is.  I had purchased it after having seen it advertised in "The Barnes Review", a publication I had previously known to be thoughtful and scholarly.  My opinion has now been altered by this experience.  The writing of this book is so poor that it is difficult to discern in many cases the intent of large portions of the narrative.  It certainly does not represent what I had hoped for, a well researched and thoughtfully presented rendering of medieval European history.  The only thing useful in this book is the standalone chronology, which can be found at the end of the book.  Dates are important in the study of history.  But excellent writing skills are equally important for the communication of the great ideas and movements of history.  And the writing herein is truly terrible.  If you are searching for an excellent book on the topic of medieval Europe, I urge you to look elsewhere.  Knowing what I know now, I would not have wasted hard earned money on this book.  Addendum 07-Apr-05:  For any who are interested in this topic of a generalized history of Western Civilization, I can heartily recommend Hilaire Belloc's "Crisis of Civilization", which is also available from Amazon.  It is beautifully written and truly excellent 
 I saw this crapfest in the theater and I should have known what I was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window, but at the entrance of the theater as well.  I only gave it one star because there wasn't a "no star" rating--even though it deserves a negative rating.    As a horror fan, I was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started, it seemed to have alot of promise.  But once we met Baby and her "family" the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate.  The movie was disgusting, repulsive, and made no clear sense--at least with Michael or Freddie you knew what the h*ll was going on.  And I thought that Blood Sucking Freaks and Blood Sucking Vampires from Pittsburgh sucked, but Corpses not only sucked, it blew. As a friend told me later, "What in the h*ll did you expect from Rob Zombie?"  What did I expect indeed.  No wonder most production firms refused to touch this film 
 Einstein's Relativity theories have had so many holes poked in them that they're starting to look like Swiss cheese and we have Quantum Physics to thank for it. Please refrain from putting them in the same context 
 Halliwell's is maddeningly opinionated and uneven.  Anyone with a passing knowledge of movies will find much to infuriate him.  For example, it dismisses James Cagney with 4 lines and Edward G. Robinson with 3 but squanders 11 lines on Jennifer Aniston and 12 on Winona Ryder. Here's what the author says about Gene Kelly, who just happens to grace the cover of this book:  "...his acting and singing abilities were minimal and his 'good guy' characterization wore a little thin."  It has a knack for finding the nastiest, cattiest quotes about the victims listed.  For example, one actress is called "a vacuum with nipples."  It tends to dwell on the more salacious personal details of the actors lives, much of which is of questionable veracity, especially gossip dealing with actors sexuality.  Also, I found many problems with the information listed such as the same quote attributed to two different people, no ending date for TV shows long off the air, and incomplete credits trailing off with "etc."  It does give helpful lists in the back of the Oscars, BAFTA, and AFI but anyone looking for a straight reference guide with dates, places of birth, complete credits, and unquestionable facts should look elsewhere.   
 Got a deal on the machine, and love the concept.  But every senseo coffee I have tasted has been absolutely horrible.  I've tried 4 oz with one pod- way too bitter so 8 oz with 1 pod...still the most awful coffee I've ever had.  Normally I drink Gevalia, but I use Folgers sometimes or Millstone... I don't think I could drink this stuff on a regular basis if someone paid me.  Of all the purchases I've made at Amazon, this has been the first time I've ever felt compelled to give feedback.  That in itself speaks volumes 
 Not having read Dava Sobel's other books, I can't comment on her skill as a writer, but this book is a disappointment. More concerned with flowery language than getting the facts straight, I read the first half of the book, then began flipping through the rest, finding myself increasingly irritated by the writing style and 'fluffy' thinking. The constant biblical references were extremely tiresome for a book supposedly dealing with facts.  Spend your money on any book by Carl Sagan, and avoid this one 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 If I want a book read to my little guys, I'll do it myself.  At least then they get to cuddle on my lap 
 While I think Ms. Burke has real talent, this book left me cold.  Despite all the other very positive reviews, I found the ongoing "back-stories" confusing and hard to follow.  Our "heroine", Irene Kelly, doesn't even appear until page 149!  And there are just too many characters, and too many family relationships to keep straight.  Not to mention too many references to other plot-lines not being explained in this book.  Perhaps this book should have been separated into two, or even three, stand-alone books.  I think "Bloodlines" would  have benefited enormously from more capable editing 
 The only reason why I watch this video is because Hunk model Tony Ward stars in it.  Tony Ward is that dreamy hunk that came out in Madonna's controversial Justify My Love video.  Since then I have not been able to get studly Tony Ward out of my mind.  He is the only reason for watching this film.  Other than that the film is not worth anything, unless you are really into all that street Hustling of Hollywood.  I warn you that this film is not very good.  Direction is bad, picture isn't that good, low budget, mediocre plot, and Extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film.  The only saving grace of the film is the hunkster Tony Ward.  If you want Tony, then this is a good film to see all of him.  Otherwise, discard the rest of the film.  This film is really not suitable for people of any age 
 This book does have a fairly intricate plot, and I did want to know what would happen to Ned and Verity...that said, do people really enjoy being clubbed over the head with a hundred redundant clues?  One of the pleasures offered by fiction is puzzling out the situation--once you've figured out a particular aspect, it just becomes tedious to be given nudge after nudge, while the dimwitted protagonist stumbles around for another 100 pages.  Willis occasionally hits the mark with her humor, but her tricks get old after a few repetitions, leading up to a climax of self-congratulatory literary allusions and treacly religious overtones.  What a disappointment 
 This book has some definitions but, for the experienced boater, its a waste of shelf space. The "rules of thumb" are too brief to have any real value 
 I bought Compton's book based on an ad in [...], a rather heavy duty marine diesel oriented web site. I already had Nigel Calder's marine diesel book and was somehow expecting more, but got less.  Calder's book is more detailed and thorough. If you have Calder's, then you don't need Compton's. So, my advice is to get Calder's marine diesel book instead 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 My twins are 3 1/2 and have not wanted to start potty training. I thought I would buy this book and see if I could have success. The day after I ordered the book, I bought my daughter some princess underwear and she suddenly became very excited about the prospect of not wearing diapers. My son immediately followed suit. Unfortunately, the book had not arrived yet, so I just had to use some common sense and good instincts. Lucky for me, this worked and my twins were potty trained by the end of the week and ready for school after Easter Break. I offered no rewards other than praise. I did not use a doll. I did not do any of the ridiculous things suggested by this book which seems very outdated. At the end of the first week back at school, the book finally arrived. I decided to read it just to see what it said and was glad it arrived so late. If you have not bought a book yet, don't buy this one. Just use common sense, don't try to train too early and let your child's success be its own reward 
 "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime" didn't just make it on my list of best books of 2005; it made it on my top-ten list of all time. That's why I was so excited to get my hands on "A Spot of Bother" by the same author. Unfortunately, this book didn't come near the interest level or originality of its predecessor.  This book reminded me of a blend of Jonathan Franzen ("The Corrections") and Nick Hornsby ("How to Be Good"), neither of which I enjoyed much. I found "Bother" to be deathly slow and the characters to be frankly uninteresting. I kept hoping one of them would die, just to liven things up, paradoxically speaking.  Though I hate to admit it, I quit reading after 150 pages. 
 As a software developer I found most of the information in this book to be something less than earth shattering.  Basically, there are companies that specialize in data mining as much information on us as they can.  The present administration is drooling over the possibility to use this information.  A large percentage of the information stored in the databases is in error.  That's pretty much the book.  Should we be concerned?  Yes, but not of the information existing because its mostly public information anyway that is being linked in creativie ways.  I'm not an advocate for this by any means but I'm not terribly fearful of it either.  What does concern me, and should you, is how much of the information is wrong and how difficult it is to get these companies to fix it.  To me, that was the greatest point the book made.  As for government spying.  We know now that the government is surveying us in much greater and more Orwellian ways than we would have thought possible.  Unfortunately, this is what I wanted to learn more about and is pretty much missing from the book.  Also, there is no "solution" provided.  How can we protect ourselves?    Mainly, I was disapointed be because every person mentioned in the book has a drawn out biography provided about them.  I really didn't care how the CEO of a data mining company grew up.  I wanted to learn about the subject of the book, not history of indivuals.  Its not a bad book, but I grew tired of the biographies and the content didn't surprise me or frighten me enough to be real impressed 
 I get more scared at the misrepresentation of a weak shortstory than anything in it. Not to take away from Sturgeon but this isa story so predictable, it makes you wonder why he even wrote it. And taking it for what it is, a sad short story-it's still not that good. It has an interesting setup, with correspondences furthering the plot, but it goes nowhere and fast. Avoid. For horror, read King or Barker.  EN 
 It does not surprize me that this book has dropped over 200% in retail price. It wouldn't even get a passing grade in a beginning creative writing class - it's that poorly written. The fact that it's being promoted as "non-fiction" is an insult to the intelligence of consumers. I can only hope that we've seen the last of James Frey. 
 Though I like Rachel Leigh Cook, and like her turn as a sulky (but really sweet) girl in 'She's All That,' and love to see her in anywhere you name it, 'Tangled' is a wrong choice.  As a thriller, it is not intriguing; as a love story, it is too familiar.  And the story is, as the film says, too tangled to take it seriously.      It is about a love-triangle that got tangled -- David (Shawn Hatsey), Alan (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and Jenny (Rachel Leigh Cook), all juniors at a college.  Jenny and David are seeing each other when Alan, handsome and reckless, steps into their college life out of the blue.  Quiet boy David (who studies poetry) and Alan were in fact friends when much younger, but because of some incidents in the past, their relations was an awkward one.  And because of Jenny's ambiguous attitudes to Alan, and Alan's seductive attitudes to Jenny, things get more complicated, and more dangerous.  That's what the opening of the film implies, by the choppy shots of flashbacks.  The film follows the memories of David, who, now hospitalized after some (still unknown) terrible accident, recounts his story before the investigator Lorraine Bracco.  So, here, the film also tries to give a twist to the otherwise mundane story, using flashbacks that slowly reveals the key events in the past.  The original intention is good, and there is a decent film buried behind the film (which I am afraid no one in English-speaking coutries have seen in theater).  There are some good shots that suggest the emotional tense between the characters.  And Rachel Leigh Cook is as sweet as before, and sexy at times.  But, unbelievably, the film takes almost one hour to explain the relations between the three, which is not particularly original.  And after that, it drifts into the revelation of the facts, in the style that faintly resembles 'Rashomon.'  But what can you do in thirty minutes with that format when you need more time to present the shifting viewpoints that challenge our perception of reality?  My overall reaction to 'Tangled' was like -- What happened to RLC?  She is as busy as before, as far as I can see her filmography on internet, but living in Japan, I hear about less and less.  Please, no more this, or 'Get Carter' or 'Anti-Trust.'  By the way, Estella Warren appears, but her role is very small, and her turn is not very outstanding.  Sorry.                       
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 My husband bought this for me for Christmas 2005.  I was thrilled to get it since I had an older, smaller model.  I had never burned any food in a slow cooker before I used this model.   I couldn't figure out how to get it to cook SLOWLY.  I finally called customer service and was told I wasn't using the right kinds of recipes.  She told me that the pot had to be at least 75% full.  I used her advice, but it still boils everything on every temperature level.  I use it to make roasts and that is all.  It "sweats" horribly and I have to put it on a cutting board so it doesn't burn my countertop.  The handle cracked after 6 months.  My biggest "ah-ha" moment was when I came home after a long day out.  There had been a power surge, and it had reset itself.  My whole meal was ruined and that is when I realized the value of a dial-knob slow cooker.  Just back away slowly from this one 
 I ordered two of the authors book's based on raving reviews from a friend, not actually this title but another. I ordered this one as well and must say what a total waste of money. The first section of the book is about the authors travels and how she claims she was visited by the Virgin Mary...umm yeah right, there isn't much practicle help in this book at all, only her boring tales of travel around the globe. The second part of the book is a list of goddesses and their qualities. don't bother with this book, it a time waster and $$$ waster I can't believe Hay house published this work of junk. After reading this authors other works I do feel she is very very over rated and has taken the angel working brigade thing a little too far and people have jumped on this band wagon if that wasn't the case this author would be unknown because her writing is terrible. The misleading promises on the back of the book should be taken off as well "Manifest anything you want instantly"...I didn't find anything in the book even about *helping* your life, it was all about her travels...Like I said a total joke..I won't be so easily led when buying books by spiritual workers again. 
 I didn't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are. I am disappointed that the "notes" are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical. Key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation, rather key terms are defined and that is all. 
 I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have "a bit on the side." And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth 
 Whenever you want find something from the book, chances are you can't find it. Moreover, some chapter go to too details while others not enough. Would not recommend to buy if you do want learn Verilog 
 I was disappointed in this book.  The title should have been something like, "A Lady Does or Does Not . . . ."  The book gives many "lady" imperatives, but does not give as many specifics on "HOW to Be a Lady." An example is the imperative, "A lady knows when it is acceptable to drink through a straw."  That's it; there is no further information as to the next obvious question:  When is it acceptable for a lady to drink through a straw?  Also it bothered me about some incorrect grammar.  I know that "a lady does not correct another's grammar," but in these published words, someone fell down on the job of editing.  There were several instances of incorrect subject-verb agreement.  One would expect a lady to know better or know that she needs aid in the written English before putting ink to published page.  Overall this book is too simplistic and does not live up to the title of "HOW To Be a Lady."   
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 I bought this for my husand as a gift and it is awful. It fell apart the first time we used it. It even caught his hand when it fell apart and drew blood. I do not recommend this product at all. 
 I purchased 4 of these units and 3 were either DOA or had to be returned because of assorted defects. I replaced them with the media Carousels by Ziotek. The software from Ziotek is not as sophisticated as Disc Stakka's but Ziotek's units are a higher quality product (and hold more DVDs) 
 I have always been a prolific reader and rarely do I come across a book for which I can find no value, no redeeming qualities. But I must extend a hearty congratulations to Julia Barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement I have ever had the misfourtune to purchace. Teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense. If you are like me and just have to read it - just because you're obsessed with Austen - Buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it 
 Wow! What a treasure trove of ideas and patterns!  You will love this book 
 This is an okay book if you already have several others and want another viewpoint. It should NOT be the only book you buy. There are too many errors and strong biases scattered throughout to make it a one-source reference. Freedom of the Hills (latest edition) is still a better resource if you're just going to have one. The Houston/Cosley book is more up to date and better researched. Twight's book is getting dated but still has good info for those who are pushing harder 
 This item is not worth $150, it looks like a cheap plastic child's toy.  Very disappointed, sent it back 
 This is the worst looking DVD I've ever seen. I loved the movie; I was delighted to see it, and bought it right away. I knew it was old and the SFX would be dated, no problem. But... watching it was like dragging fingernails over a blackboard. It jitters. It blurs. It hiccups. The color is bad.  The only other DVD I've ever run into that was even close to this bad was "The Final Countdown"; I can't help but think this DVD is actually defective in some way, except for the fact that it plays continuously without any complaints from my hardware.  So... if you loved Outland, I guess this is what you have to buy, but man... be prepared for a sub-sub-sub-optimal experience 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 I was pretty excited when I saw this book, but it was quite a let down when I received it. Over half of the book deals with science-fiction instead of fantasy and it also includes lots of computer made art. The best  artists of the fantasy art world were left out. There are some interesting  pieces in this book, but it was not really what I was hoping for 
 This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason. 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Have you ever had a really attractive girl wholeheartedly recommend a book to you? And have you ever been annoyed that this book turned out to be shallow propaganda, where there are no characters and only caricatures, where the beef-eaters are stupid and evil, and where the lesbians are perfect? Maybe the attractive girl was from the UK, and maybe the book was "My Year of Meat" (as published there.)   As other reviewers have mentioned, there are redeeming moments in this novel, but they will fade away toward the end as the reader starts drowning in schmaltz, cliche, and beef blood. Skip this book. Choose one that doesn't try to teach you a lesson 
 I have seen every episode(most, more than once). I am 15 years old. When I recieved this book, it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know about the West Wing. A synopsis of the episodes and biographies on the gifted actors and actresses who star in the show. Anyone who would buy this book, has to be a fan of the award-winning Wednsday night drama, and honestly, if you are that much of a fan of the show, you don't need the book 
 BUT if you are a Christian looking for what the Bible says about marriage you need to look elsewhere (there are plenty of excellent balanced books by Christians on this topic).   There is just enough Bible verses BIble principles in this book to fool most Christians unaware of the teachings of Christian Reconstructisim and its dangers. Wilson is a strong Reconstructionist--which is nothing less than Christian Nazism. God's Word has much to say about those cursing Israel.   This is SERIOUS dangerous movement followed by many leaders within the homeschool movement (see "The Road to Holocaust" by Hal Lindsey for a real eye opening about the Reconstruction/Dominion cult). Christian Reconstructionism is not Christian; it's a cult and needs to be treated as one. 
 I dont know where they found this joker.  This music is simply not good.  Its like smooth jazz with this guy singing along to these ridiculously simple song structures that simply are repetitive and don't sound good.  This music goes absolutly no where and it is very boring.  A lot of  this guys music is [borrowed] too.  Also their is a song called Donkey Tonkey on here which really made me want to [hit] this guy, its like a kids anthem "Do the Donkey, the Donkey Tonkey" .. 
 The author Thomas Carlyle presents the history of the French Revolution as a prophetic poetry of his intellect, and rightfully burned on his presentation for review.  As reading this book realize the great store of words and meanings that suited his direction rather than the true nature of the French Revolution of the peoples.  What an awful book 
 I used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades. I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond.  I've read all 60 reviews before mine, and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem. Maybe it's my shaving technique, but this thing is a weapon 
 The DVD isn't a good abs workout or a cardio video.  The section on obliques at the end is good but only a few minutes.  The instructor was motivational but I didn't find the moves that creative or intense 
 I don't know what everyone's on but this album doesn't come close to dreamland.   Strange vocals and beats that are rather boring and nothing like his previous album, sounds like jazz or something.  Miles time is over.  I had kinda expected this from Miles after seeing him at a concert some years ago where he was literally BOOed off the stage for such a horrible performance.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.  Save your money 
 This book not only had spelling errors and NO pictures, it actually said "Not ready for publishing" when I recieved it.  I got this for my dad as one of his christmas presents and I really wish I could get my money back 
 This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it.  Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly.  However, the ending really killed it for me.  It's too unnecessarily long.  Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah.  I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment.  But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book.  Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end 
 My review agrees entirely with an earlier reviewer. This book was not purchased from Amazon.com, I saw it in a bookshop and liked the look of the designs. Although I have not made many knitted toys, I am an experienced knitter. I am at present deciphering my way through the pattern for Loulou the elephant - the pattern has errors and combined with a lack of schematics it is taking a little longer than it should. The only other book I have used for knitted toys is "The Knitted Teddy Bear" by Sandra Polley and as it turns out is published by the same publisher. Sandra Polley's book by comparison is a gold mine of instructions, schematics and general help. And so far, no errors. Toys to Knit is another of those books that uses Rowan yarns and why is it that they ALWAYS stipulate far more yarn than is required? Just another sales tool of Rowan Yarns 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 When I read the Constance Garnett translation of this novel 15 years ago, it became on of my favorites. But when I was reading the Larissa Volokhonsky, Richard Pevear translation I had trouble staying with the book for any length of time. So I switched to the David McDuff translation and I really began to enjoy the book again. I just think that Volokhonsky and Pevear don't write english very well. Frankly, there are frequent times when their translations make no sense at all. There was a big marketing effort behind the publications of their translations, and I bought into it. I liked the blurbs on the back covers, and tried reading some of their russian translations. But once I got into the habit of comparing translations, I saw that McDuff, Jessie Coulson, and others write much more readable translations.  These books aren't easy to get through; and I would hate to see someone discouraged by a poor translation. I recommend comparing one paragraph in two translations if you can. You'll notice the difference, and be able to pick out the translation that's right for you 
 I listened to the audio book version of this book. At first, it seemed quite refreshing to know men and women were so different that you could explain in your work environment why people behaved like that. However, it just didn't give any solution and keep saying it over and over again in this book can bore anyone.   This book is more like a psychology paper rather than a practical handbook. The person who performed the book makes it more disturbing.  In one word, from this book, you will understand that people are so different that you can't expect others will think like you. Men are more hierachical and women are nice and think all men are equal. My understanding is that even if it is like this, you can only be yourself 
 The inaccuracies which plague this book are many.  The author has allowed a vitriolic personal bias against Christianity to take the place of historical accuracy.  In addition to the stunning inaccuracies, the venomous, contemptuous tone of every reference to the Christian faith is problematic.  In this day of tolerance, it is surprising that anyone would allow their personal prejudices to be so visible and so hateful, especially in a book for children!  In a book which is supposedly based upon history, it is surprising that anyone would print out-and-out lies such as are found in this book.  Why did I give it two stars?  Because the text, when it is not too busy attacking the author's imaginary archenemy, is refreshing and useful.  It is humorous, winsomely written, and fun.  The illustrations are great, too.  It's sad that the author's personal biases have marred this otherwise fine work 
 This is one of the most horribly muddled "thrillers" I've ever read.  By the end, I wasn't sure who was "winning" or "losing," nor did I really care.  Clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing.  He should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on Dirk Pitt.  
 There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one 
 I picked this up looking for a back-to-basics book only to find that the book doesn't really talk to a modern audience. It's very film-centric in ways that may not help people dealing with the very different choices offered by digital cameras -- that is, it's not going to give you much guidance for either taking digital snapshots or using more advanced technical controls. This really is a book from the early '90s with a 21st century gloss on it 
 The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out 
 I give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented, "DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson." This most difinitive "unproven" statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he "seems" to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what "reason" he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers. He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. Unless I overlooked it, I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist  Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity.  I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA  sources. The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians,(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon.    From what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A. Foster with the DNA study), Mr. Wade's analysis of this is extremely limited, in fact, it is extremely biased. "Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings" (pg 257). What truthful fact does he have to give this statement? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co., Ohio. Why the details in a book topic such as this? I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion. As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books, these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales. He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges. You may read on my web page: www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study.   He cannot plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion. Can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge. My knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited, BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no current or original research. He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of "authority" on the controversy. She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson's grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words. To add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking, Wade has a figure with the title, "Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings.(Pg.260-261)." His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters (an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct.   He does not mention a very scholarily book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry, "Anatomy of a Scandal, Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story", who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging. Since he did not give the reader another source for study, another VERY interesting book, "Jefferson Vindicated, Falacies, Omissions,and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search", I will tell you it has a foreword by former Monticello Director, James A, Bear, Jr. All of the named books, including, "The Jefferson-Hemings Myth" are available through Amazon.   I do agree with Wade's last sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy......."Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve." I might add that contrived history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of "another" Hemings DNA source.....only ONE originally tested.

 I like what Phil Rogers said about CETACEAN. But to me, CETACEAN doesn't sound surfadelic so much as cheezadelic. As a matter of fact, it's arguably the apotheosis of mod-a-go-go cheezpop. SUSAN doesn't impress me. I don't hear what nicjaytee hears in it.  CJ & The Fish also did a few tracks for a soundtrack called ZACARIAH. And ZACARIAH isn't included at amazon. So allow me to say something about it here. Ya know all of those song lyrics wherein the singer brags about the modesty of his needs? Well, let it be known that Barry Melton wrote a parody of that obnoxious mentality in a tune called ALL I NEED: "All I need to have a good time is a reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. With those 3 things I don't need no sunshine. A reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. All I want is to never grow old. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I want 97 kilos already rolled. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I wanna light my cigars with 10-dollars bills. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills. I'd like a bottle of red-eye that's always filled. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills. 
 Frankly, I'm a bit surprised over the reviews favoring this book. Yes, it does appear written by someone knowledgeable about the markets; yes, he does reveal *his* methods, but therein lies the problem. What, exactly, are his methods? They are a disjointed mix of different techniques that *he* subjectively uses without really providing a methodical framework for how you can implement those same methods. The book is somewhat like a fellow rambling on and on sitting next to you on a bus, without really showing you HOW to do what he does. Believe me, I picked up the book really *wanting* to believe it could help me and making every effort to make the book *work*. But in the end, I put it back on the bookshelf along with all the other hocum that's out there on trading. Definitely not worth the $40.00 it lists for 
 I have just received the book which I bought "new" from Amazon -- but no patterns are included.  Since techniques are based on the patterns which should come with the book, without them, the book is not useful. I called Amazon and explained that I need only the "patterns".  They sent me another copy of the book.  Again, without the patterns.   Would some one at Amazon look into this please?  This book is of no use without the patterns 
 When we tried to play the item on our DVD player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to return it.  We ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer, which worked properly.  I am upset that the full purchase price was not refunded.  I can see deducting shipping and handling.  But, a restocking charge -- that is outrageous!  The merchandise did not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it!  Please remind me not to buy from amazon.com 
 I feel bad for my parents for buying me this gift for xmas.  It sounded great when I first hooked it up, but now it just stopped working.  The unit's display will now only show random pixels, and it turns on and off on its own.  The power button on the unit or remote don't really do anythign anymore.  Still sounds good, but I have no idea if it's on or off or what input it's passing.  Hopefully the store will take it back.  Look at the sony model instead 
 This book contains a great deal about the supernatural, but very little about Maine.  For example, page after page is devoted to the cursed cars owned by James Dean and the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, the Hope Diamond, the GREAT EASTERN disaster, exorcism, etc., etc., but there is no "Maine" connection.       In a chapter entitled "Witches and Their World," the author makes several errors of fact concerning the Salem Witch Trials.  Then, in a lame attempt to include Maine in the witch madness of the late 17th century, he recounts the story of Barbara Houndsworth, the well-known "Ghost of Belfast, Maine," whom he admits was probably accused and convicted of a crime other than witchcraft.  Had Mr. Stevens done his homework, he would have included the fact that the Rev. George Burroughs, one of the men hanged at Salem in 1692, was living and preaching in the Casco Bay area of Maine at the time he was arrested for the practice of witchcraft.  Additionally, Maine is famous for its lighthouses, many of which are said to be haunted.  I can name 10 haunted lighthouses in Maine without even thinking yet, Mr. Stevens comes up with only five.  Either he has no interest whatsoever in the supernatural and/or folklore, or he lacks the ability to research a subject.  There are some wonderful books about supernatural events in Maine, but this isn't one of them. 
 My apologies to all the Hemingway fans, but I didn't really care for this book. I had a hard time understand what was going on throughout the book. One bright spot was when they were in the mountains fishing and it is always nice to read of another country that is not yours. The characters did not appeal to me, I wouldn't want to party with any of them. They seemed lost and spoiled. Grabbing a quick peek at the Cliff Notes in a book store for this book; I found some of my conclusions were valid. But unfortunately it just wasn't for me. If you try this book I wish you luck 
 As a clinician-scientist, I believe in evidence based medicine There is no evidence base to support the work-out shown here to my knowledge have been proven to build bones as opposed to other types of exercise. As scientist from respected institution like NASA can tell you, the only most important way the body needs to stimulate bone building is periodic weight-bearing exercises & stepping. The same view is shared by neurophysiologists of NIH of USA This kind of title is extremely misleading & should be taken with a grain of sal 
 This was recommended to me by someone on LiveJournal. I hate to say this, but I really didn't like it at all. I thought I would, but after the first few pages I knew it was going to be difficult to get through it. The major problem is that I couldn't relate to the author at all. I think it may be because I don't take reading as seriously as she does. All the books she referred to were classics, heavy reading for intellectuals. Then she spent some time talking about how she thought movies weren't a worthwhile form of art and how horrible it was that some books were made into movies. These viewpoints go completely against what I believe and the way she put them across made her come off rather haughty. The book also seems a bit like someone talking about their own vacation. By the middle of the book, I realized I would rather be reading a good book than reading about somebody reading 
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 This book has some good information regarding different styles and techniques for drawing. The author is a little self absorbed throughout the book, and talks about herself and a class she teaches at a college. It goes fairly in depth on the thought process and workings of the brain.  There are sections on drawing different emotions, once again using herself and her students as examples. I wouldn't really suggest that anyone buy or check out this book in a library unless there was absolutely nothing else that related to what they were looking for...that's why I got this book. 
 Video quality could be better and the appearances of featured 'star'were fewer than expected 
 I found this book to contain many recipes that contain ingredients that I can't have (I'm in the early stages of treatment so fruits, nuts, some grains, etc. are out for now) and many ingredients that Dr Crook suggests avoiding for a while in newer books. I'm sure the recipes will be more usefull after I've completed treatment and I'm working on maintenance, but that's not what I needed right now. Some tips on how to cook beans and veggies were somewhat helpfull but I think there are better books out there for the early staged of treatment. Consider getting it from your library before buying it 
 I purchased this book in the PX at Kandahar. Reading the jacket I expected to get a story about an American living in Kabul, post Taliban.  What I got was a history of sorts, of Afghanistan, and even that was difficult to read due to the Anti-Americanism, and Anti Administration thoughts and ranting of the Author.   I do not mind people voicing their opinions, but thats not why I purchased the book. There was very little information regarding the current situation (in my view) in Kabul. Unless of course you were wanting to read about how the United States has made life miserable for most Afghanis, or how the United States has ruined the country. If the Author was not bashing the US, or the current administration, she was talking about how terrible conditions are in the country for women.  I am not sure she was living in the same Kabul I have spent time in in the last 8 months. I am sure she got a different view due to the face she spent a lot of time in the Womens Prison, interviewing inmates. and looking into education in the area, but from what I read, she spent a lot more time sitting in gardens drinking tea, talking to other NGO workers (who seem to sit around talking and socializing more than actually helping the people here).  If you want a rant on how terrible the US is, and what a useless dork President Bush is, by all means, buy this book. if you are looking to see how things are in Afghanistan on a day to day basis this one might not be for you 
 This kettle has the wonderful, traditional Le Creuset whistle when the water comes to a boil.  It has elegant styling and a durable vessel.  What  one would expect from such a respecable brand.  So why does the handle get too hot to the touch?  Everytime one wants to pour a cup of hot water one must attempt to endure discomfort bordering on pain, or fetch a piece of cloth as insulation.  Surely heat conductive materials were not the best choice for the handle.  And why is the the lid fitted so snuggly that one needs place ones palm on the handle and grasp the lids knob with the fingers, then squeeze to make a fist in order to get enough leverage to pull the lid off?  It was only after the knob finally broke off that I discovered that the threaded screw holding it on was less than 4 millimeters long.  After 4 months of use, into the trash this kettle goes.  I expected better from a brand like Le Creuset 
 This is not the book I was expecting... I know the author try her best, but I found that this book have very few names for each letter, in fact I found out more french names in other book than in this one, and the title  foucuses on French names.....I'm a bit dissapointed. The cover it's great  but the lack on information is wat I regret...Certainly, in my opinion it  is not worth it's value, in fact, I'll try to return it, it is not what I  was expecting 
 McMurtry must have been paid by the word.  Concepts, charactarizations and actions are recounted time after time, and they are often pointless and without interest or entertainment.  It is painful to read such pointless drive 
     The hour long DVD is alot of fun but not as much fun as the camcorder videos I shot back in the days when Jimmy concerts were the highlight of the summer and isn't worth twenty plus dollars. As for the audio part. Did we really need a 7th live recording of Cheesburger in Paradise?    I may be middle-aged, I hate to admit, but I'm not quite dead yet, Jimmy and I just don't want to hear the same stuff over and over again. Bill Jabanoski's "Key West, Island of Dreams" makes me feel young and like there's still alot more life left to live. This tired playing out of your former glory doesn't.     Sorry. This is from a Parrothead who was one before they called us that. 
 Enjoyment of Hardison's book depends on the purpose of your reading--for leisure or credit.  I first read it as a requirement for a class I was taking and did not appreciate it on its face.  It gives a picture of 20th century art, architecture, poetry and science. It offers up interesting comparisons of artist's oddities and scientists inquisitiveness and how each prejudiced the other throughout the century. It is an interesting picture.  If you are familiar with 20th century art and technology but strive to gain a deeper understanding of culture and technological changes, this book is for you 
 I was going to use the book last week but then I realized that I had gotten a totally different book than the one I ordered.  I didn't realize it when I received it in the mail I guess 
 This was a gorgeous show, but kind of conservative -- made Richter into the new "master" of painting, sidelines all his weirder and more "conceptual" work. And why does Robert Storr have to try so hard to put himself at the center of everything?? I saw the Richter show in SF around 1990, so no, this is NOT "the frist American retrospective." And Storr's dismissive (and often really uninformed) treatment of other critics (especially German critic Benjamin Buchloh, who's written on Richter for like, decades) shows what a limited writer and scholar Storr really is. But for better or worse, the pictures are great, and a lot of the other material is really good 
 I had a problem when I first used it. Sony support suggested buying different DVD's, but still no luck recording more than 20 seconds, finally got a Sony tech who knew it needed repairing or replacing. After much time and expense shipping and more phone calls, it was replaced. Worked okay for about a year One year later, after warranty is up, it doesn't work again. I  would not recommend this unit. Software is slow and remote is lousy too. Only can do one hour of high quality at this point in technology.  I would wait another year before investing in a DVD recorder 
 DREAM CATCHER, by Margaret A. Salinger, is easily the most loathsome book I've read in a decade.  Ms. Salinger, J. D. Salinger's daughter, is so unsympathettic an individual that by the halfway mark of this disjointed and far-too-long narrative, I was finding fresh cause for disgust on every page.  Her parents weren't perfect, no, but my sympathies are with them nonetheless.  Ms. Salinger's problems are often normal growing pains.  When they are not, they stem largely from being the product of an unhappy marriage and from the isolation of a rural upbringing (as has been noted in other reviews).  Her problems are decidedly not due to her father's celebrity, a non-issue as he has so laboriously avoided those trappings for decades.  Ms. Salinger is a malcontent: she can't stand her parents' attention; she can't stand her parents' perceived neglect.  She is a hypocrit: she steals $150 from her brother's bank account (for which she never expresses any remorse) to pay for an abortion, but years later, pregnant again, single and with no appreciable income, stridently condemns her father for mentioning abortion as an option.  She is self-destructive: her initial bouts of "madness" are clearly alcohol-related blackouts, yet it never occurs to her to stop drinking.  She has reached middle-age still believing that every bad thing that ever happened to her is someone else's fault, and this is both the saddest and most annnoying part of the book.  Ms. Salinger is not a tremendously talented writer.  However, she is done an atrocious disservice by her editors.  The footnotes are silly, the narrative digressive to the point at times of incoherence, some of Ms. Salinger's comments nonsensical.  In a passage quoted here by other reviewers, in which Holden Caufield imagines himself a catcher in the rye, Ms. Salinger writes: "When I read this passage as an adult with a child of my own, my first reaction was outrage...Where were the grown-ups? Why are those kids allowed to play so close to the edge of a cliff?"  Hmmm...I thought that passage was the fantasy of a fictitous, troubled teenager.  Perhaps J. D.'s intent there was to write not a parenting tip, but something true to Holden's character.  If the purposes of writing this memoir were, as Ms. Salinger claims, for personal catharsis and as a lesson for her son, both those aims would have been fully realized by completing the manuscript and handing it directly to her son.  Ms. Salinger does more than that, however.  She publishes.  And this smacks not only of cashing in on her surname with the only form of her writing ever likely to see the light of day, but of a vindictive slap in her father's face, yet another round in a family feud from which we'd all best keep our distance

 After playing this game for the third time I had a thought, 'WHY DID I BUY THIS!' This game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly. I cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other NBA Street's. Save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game 
 I bought this movie to watch it in 3d on a front projection system with a 6 foot wide screem . I bought the recommended 3d equipment to see it, and while it almost works it was disappointing.  They need to get the bugs out. You can watch this movie in 2D and its entertaining but it would really be impressive in the 3d mode it was intended for.  I am sending the  equipment back and the three other movies that came with it..If this equipment is improved I'd like to try it again 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 "The Future of War" predicts US dominance of warfare throughout the 21st Century, as a result of US advanced technology in general and precision weaponry in particular. Their train of thought has considerable merit, and deserves reading and thoughtful attention. However, the book suffers from the same two major flaws as most books by visionaries without enough practical experience: misunderstanding of specific happenings in the past, and unlikely projections into the far future. Having been involved with US defense for 50 years, as a member of the military, as a designer and developer and advisor on US weaponry, and as an advisor on strategic, operational and tactical issues, I read this book with considerable amusement, although I do take seriously much of what it says. I shall give specifics on two failures to understand the details of the past, and then offer criticism of two of the book's projections, as examples.  Past episode #1: The 1991 precision strikes against Iraq. There is no doubt that our air strikes and land attacks in the 1991 campaign to liberate Kuwait were exceedingly effective, and there is no doubt that this effectiveness was largely due to our precision weaponry. However, to do precision strikes, whether with airborne munitions or ground forces, it's necessary to know what targets to attack, where they are, and what weapons are likely to be effective against a particular target. In the 1991 campaign, this effort was undertaken by the "Jeddi Knights", largely under the guidance of Col. John Warden. The key role of the "Jeddi Knights" was to establish priorities and mission profiles for which targets to strike when with what munitions, and they did this extraordinarily well. What the Friedmans obviously don't know is the amount of detailed information that was available to the "Jeddi Knights", carefully acquired over the 70 years preceding the campaign, first by the British until about 1950, and thereafter by the US military. The armed forces of major powers assume they may have to fight wars on short notice aganst opponents who have been designated shortly before by national authorities, so they invest a great deal in gathering information pertinent to how various campaigns might be conducted. In the case of Iraq, the British did very careful mapping from 1920 until about 1950, producing "ordnance" maps of higher detail and accuracy than exist even for some parts of the United States, and these were invaluable to planners. Then, starting in about 1950, when it began to seem possible that the US might someday have to fight somewhere in the Middle East, the US military carefully gathered information relevant to how a campaign might be fought, and which potential enemy targets should be candidates for destruction. These studies resided in US intelligence and military archives until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and were then used as the basis for planning the campaign.  Two examples of this. First, the destruction of certain bridges was given high priority not to impede vehicular movement, but to sever the communications cables running under the bridges; our planners knew which cables important to Iraqi Command and Control were buried too deeply to destroy easily except where they were routed under bridges, and therefore which bridges to take out to disrupt Iraqi military communications. Second, the swing by US, British and French forces far to the West, the "Hail Mary" gambit, would not have been possible in that harsh terrain unless viable routes for armor and supply vehicles were known, and the Iraqi Army either didn't know of such routes or didn't believe we could know of them. There are exactly two feasible routes, and both were used; they can both be determined in complete detail from careful study of the British Ordnance maps prepared in the 1930s, and (although I wasn't involved in the campaign planning) I had no difficulty in finding and plotting the only two feasible routes before the ground campaign began, from the good maps in my possession. I also understand why it was necessary to bring the two prototype JSTARS systems to the theatre, to detect and allow blocking of any Iraqi strike intended to sever the Tapline Road; this was also evident from the maps.  By contrast, we had no success at all in locating and destroying mobile Scud missile launchers, because they moved around with great frequency. If you don't know where something is, no precision of your weaponry, and no amount of technical sophistication or military skill, will allow you to destroy it.  Past example #2: The SAFEGUARD BMD system. The Friedmans say, on the basis of assertions by people who may or may not be experts, that SAFEGUARD was deactivated because it wouldn't work. In fact the situation was exactly the reverse, but one must know the purpose of SAFEGUARD and its mode of operation to understand what actually happened. The mission of SAFEGUARD was to prevent complete success of a Soviet counterforce first strike against our Minuteman ICBM fields, by opening a "launch window" for a retaliatory strike by the Minuteman missiles in the face of a full-scale Soviet strike. I helped to plan and design that system, and it would have done what it was intended to, although at a horrible increased toll of death and destruction, which I dreaded, but could see no alternative to in the face of rapidly increasing Soviet capability. Far more important than the fact that we knew SAFEGUARD would work was the fact that the Soviets concluded it would work; that realization brought them back to the bargainng table at the Helsinki talks, and led to the SALT I treaty, which I rejoiced about. Provisions of that treaty made SAFEGUARD unnecessary, and that's why the one completed SAFEGUARD site was deactivated and construction on the other sites was stopped.  Also on the subject of balistic missile defense, the Friedmans assert that midcourse discrimination and destruction of incoming warheads is infeasible. This is simply not true, although there is an exceedingly serious problem associated with doing it. I know three quite different ways of doing midcourse discrimintion and destruction of enemy incoming warheads, and, given that I've been out of that business for more than 10 years, I expect that other ways are known by now. The problem is that, at least for the three ways I know, one is politically unacceptable to the US Congress and the US public, one is so expensive that it's unlikely Congress would ever fund it, and the third, if fully developed, would be usable for certain other military purposes that would probably lead to a renewed arms race as our potential major opponents sought to counter it. (I was one of a small group of scientists who successfully recommended to Congress that development of that third approach be stopped, to avoid the resulting foreseeable escalation; scientists and military professionals, despite various comments in the Friedmans' book, work closely together over years and decades, and come to have considerable knowledge of each other's fields.) Whether at some future time it may become desirable to develop and deploy a BMD system that does midcourse discrimination and destruction of warheads is a political and diplomatic question to be decided by the public and its elected leaders, on which I have no insight, but it is technically feasible.  Now, turning to the future, what the Friedmans fail to understand in their glowing vision of US technology dominating future warfare, is that for every technical advance, opponents can devise at least partial countermeasures, and that therefore no amount of technology as such can determine the outcome of a campaign. The Coalition conquest of Iraq in 2003 provides an excellent example. Although large parts of the Iraqi army, and all of its top leadership, was utterly incompetent, other large parts of the Iraqi army were composed of thoroughly trained officers and enlisted men, who fully understood that if they confronted US forces nose to nose, they would be destroyed. Understanding this, very many of the best Iraqi units simply demobilized themsleves and disappeared into the civilian population as Coalition forces approached, in many cases taking their weaponry with them. One entire Iraqi division near the border with Iran totally vanished before we got to its bases; everyone from the division commander to the most junior private. Professional soldiers, even if motivated to fight, have no more desire than anyone else to be killed pointlessly in a situation where they are unable to resist effectively.  A substantial fraction of these well-trained, motivated Iraqi forces subsequently emerged as part of the resistance movement that continues in Iraq. How many of the resistance fighters come from that crowd is obviously impossible to know for sure, but my personal estimate is that about 30,000 of Saddam Hussein's best and most loyal troops and officers became part of the resistance movement. And our overwhelming superiority in all aspects of conventional warfare have been far less effective against current Iraqi resistance methods; the resistance movement seems to be gradually weakening and fragmenting, but it's a long slow process, in which our precision weapons and our advanced communications and intelligence give us far less of an advantage than they do in conventional warfare.  There are various other gaps in the Friedmans' assessment of the future. I'll mention only two of many. First, vircators, often touted as the most effective weapon of the 21st Century, have had only relatively diappointing results so far. Why? Partly because technical improvements to vircators are needed; those will surely come along in due course. Much more serious is the fact that battle damage asssessment after a vircator strike is at present almost impossible to do with any degree of accuracy, so after a target has been attacked with one or more vircators, there is no practical way to know whether the strike was successful or not. Presumably some day we will overcome this particular problem, but it illustrates that new and potentially formidable technology may find relatively little application because of purely tactical and operational problems that arise in using it.  As my second example, I'll remark on the Friedmans' vision of US infantrymen as being in effect "cocooned" in future to protect them from the enemy's weapons. This vision ignores two serious problems. First, no "cocoon" imaginable can protect an infantryman against certain weapons such as a fuel-air bomb if the enemy knows approximately where the infantryman is. Second, and closely related, anyone with substantial experience in concealing himself in a hostile environment, including me, knows all too well that the more accoutrements one has, the harder it is to hide and not be observed. In light clothing and carrying only light personal weapons, I can disappear into the landscape almost anywhere, and move around unnoticed; burdened with excess equipment and elaborate protective clothing, only certain carefully selected spots can offer concealment. Everyone with experience in this matter knows as much as I do on this subject, so infantrymen whose lives depend on not being observed will move far more cautiously when heavily burdened than when lightly armed and lightly protected. That doesn't mean infantry should be sent into combat inadequately equipped, but it does mean that the increased effectiveness of some given number of trained infantry when provided with extra combat capability and protective equipment is far less than one might otherwise suppose.  I could cite dozens of other matters, past and projected, which the Friedmans book misunderstands or overlook, but this is enough. I'll just say that the book is an excellent source of ideas, but should be viewed with practiced skepticism 
 Although this book was recommended to me by a professional I must say that I was terribly disappointed. Out of the entire book the only part I actually did agree with was that in general a lot of us treat dogs as humans when they really should be treated like the animals that they are.   With that in mind, Donaldson believes dogs to be quite stupid and not capable of working for anything other than food. I have had and trained dogs for years and have never had to result to such pandering. Dog's are extremely intelligent and can be taught anything without giving a treat every few seconds. (She even suggests using cut up hot dogs to 'motivate' your dog. Those hot dogs with all the perservatives and additives are going to do more damage to the dog than whatever the behavior is worth.)  She focuses an inordinate amount of time to teaching a dog to fetch saying that this one move will solve most other problems. I can't disagree more. The things that works best for dogs is exercise and strong leadership. Besides, some breeds are generally not interested in playing fetch but rather doing the activites for which is bred in the first place.  Also, Donaldson tries to refute Pack Theory, which takes into account the fact that dogs evolved from wolves and hence have a strict social hierarchy, by showing her own ignorance on the subject. In her view she only sees dominance as being cruel and punishing your dog into submission. When in reality it alleviates the need for punishing since your dog will do what you say because he knows that you are the boss.  Throughout the book she contradicts herself constantly on her own points. This shows me that she does not have a great deal of self examination of her own information and that it isn't worth much.  I believe that her book does very little to help people with dogs that have any issues whatsoever.   I recommend Cesar Milan's book and his approach. I have used several of his techniques with no damage to my dog, as Donaldson would have you believe, and I got the results that I wanted.   Do not buy Culture Clash as it is really only good for being recycled. 
 The book was great. The ending TERRIBLE. This is becoming a pattern with his books!!!! AVOI 
 I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.   It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.   Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader.  
 "This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad." - Prologue.  Well, that certainly could have been the story.  But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in "the history of the horse") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so.  Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book.  So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered.  Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go. 
 Richard Haass attempts to distinguish himself from the neocons. Aside from form, however, the substance really isn't any different. Both begin with the assumption that American Imperium is a requirement for peace and prosperity and any real deviation means *global* catastrophe. Any suggestion that American Imperium itself is the problem is simply beyond the pale, and is dismissed by all sides of american foreign policy elite (neocons and neorealists) as "unserious" or worse. Neocons and neorealists are 2 sides of the same coin. The "argument" between them is kabuki theater. A pointless handwringing melodrama, signifying little and meaning even less. At their core, both are motivated by a proconsul's view of the world where the only future of humanity worth living is one where america's elite, and the children of america's elite, are the one's calling the shots.   It's not a view shared by the rest of the world 
 this book is as much about the gypsy communities as it is about confirming the author's own preconceived notion of  what eastern europe is (or what is not): in her own words, "certainly not a melting pot."  i will not comment on how the author deals with the main subject of her book, on the gypsy communities, its cultural heritage and its current problems- as a romanian, i am ashamed i know very little about it, and i was hoping to find out some answers by reading this book; i did not. there is one point where i agree on with the autor, when she deplores the absence of this subject from the public debate and modern scholarship.  let me now say what this book excels at: A. lack of scholarship.....: the author does a poor job identifying her sources. the 15 century of eastern europe as seen through the eyes of this author is full of surprises; to give just one example, "the princes of the teritories that would become romania made great fortunes of war, supplying food to constantinople". this is quite funny  given the intricate politics among the ottoman empire and the various genoese and venetian principalities that controlled the trade in the area at that time. what is more surprising is the almost random insertion of this statement in the context of the book.  B... to donwright plagiarism: one chapter of her book is entitled "temptation to exist" which is the famous title of a book by the romanian author emil cioran. name-dropping cannot replace bibliography (and this is unfortunately one of the more annoying habits of romanian scholars that the author seemed to have taken to).  C.... to insulting ignorance: is she aware of the sympathy of young cioran for the iron guard movement in the 30'? is paraphrasing a fascist sympathizer appropriate in a book about opressed minorities?   D... to cold war cliches: "to the people of the balkans, [the ursars... gypsies travellers with dancing bears] must have been a wonderful sight in the grueling last years of communism. for some reason, in ceausescu's romania people continue to pay money..." a bit assuming isnt it? well, what else were doing romanians during communism? gymnastics, nastase, sucking their own blood...perhaps, since even even the "literacy of the average romanian" is subject of mockery. E...to selective 20 century history: here again the evil spirit of eastern european chauvinism  is the obvious cause of all the evils of the century, if it weren't for other standard choices: nazy germany, etc... how about mussolini? there is not one mention   about mussolini and the fate of gypsies in italy...   For various reasons (perhaps some or many of them good) the author hates the country i am from. sometimes i do too. but i think a writer, an intellectual, should always be ready to engage in dialogue and thus set an example rather than labelling people (who did not benefit from the same schooling as the author did) as ignorant folk. on the contrary, this author does not permit even her (close?) romanian asisstant so much as a "tentative revelation" on the subject (these are the author's own words!!), not to mention that she misspelled her name (twice) in the acknowledgement.    Finally, i have a recommendation if you want to know more about gypsies and eastern europe check out emir kusturica's brilliant movies 
 This book had potential, but the terrible character developement and choppy flow of the book blew it.  The end leaves you with more questions than the LEFT BEHIND SERIES books do!! 
 i'm not exactly sure why i bought this book.  something about the blurb and first couple paragraphs caught my eye... not to mention the vintage photo on the cover.  but, ultimately, i'm disappointed.  the story plays out in the first 75 pages and consequently drags through another 225 until it finally ends in glazed-over, lamely symbolic scene that involves a doe serenely staring down the main character across the snow-covered Vermont campus.  The authors use of question marks in her younger characters' dialog was mildly amusing the first time, but quickly grew old with over use.  And she had lots adjectives that didn't add anything but ambiguity to otherwise clear and concise descriptions.  I'd like to get her address and mail her this horrible failure of a novel... so I don't have to look at it on my bookshelf and be reminded of the time i wasted reading it.   i give it two stars only because it kept my disgusted attention...  just like a multiple car crash on the highway 
 I have long considered myself a Christian with moderate theological views, standing between the extremes of both right wing fundamentalism and liberalism.  So when I saw this book on the shelf I looked forward to reading it.  Unfortunately Bawer's idea of a "fundamentalist" is anyone to the right of the notorious Bishop Spong.  Time and again he employs the "either/or" fallacy: either one is an enlightened, left-wing, revisonist, touchy-feely, creed-hating "Christian" or a naive, dim-witted Bible thumper.  Nowhere in Bawer's prejudice is there any sign of the tolerance he lambasts others for lacking.  Nor is there any mention of believers such as Tony Campolo, Jim Wallis, Luke Timothy Johnson or Ron Sider, who stand in the center of many political and theological issues. According to Bawer such individuals simply don't exist.  In addition he makes numerous false statments.  A glaring example in on page 40, where he claims that the doctrine of the substitutionary atonement was invented by Augustine in the fifth century.  He ignores Jesus' own statements  throughout the four gospels on the meaning of his death.    In fact he shamelessly employs a pick and choose approach to Christ which ignores anything the Lord said that doesn't fit his politically correct conception of the Saviour.  The result is a Jesus that resembles Alan Alda far more than the character portrayed in Scripture.  I could go into detail about these weaknesses, but to do so would simply be a repetition of prior reviewers.  Suffice it to say that those looking for a balanced treatment of Christian fundamentalism should look elsewhere.    
 Morris' presents an apologetic on the standard topics such as the divinity of Jesus, the resurrection, NT textual reliability, is the bible the Word of God?, etc.  The content is ho-hum.  Both the arguments he employs and the support he rallies are very basic, with little tackling of objections.  He lacks the philosophical background necessary for a rigorous discussion of God's existence, and possesses a level of biblical scholarship quite inferior to others who write similar books.  As he's done in other books, he discusses his pet theories of gospel in the stars and numerology.  The former is very questionable, while the latter is only somewhat less so, yet totally inappropriate for a book of this type.  Morris, though prolific in writing, is writing books he really shouldn't.  In the apologetic arena, there are simply superior options written by much more qualified people.  Unless you're discussing this book with 12 year olds or those lacking both critical thinking skills and the desire to use them, avoid this book.  It's dated, simplistic, and written by someone who has no business writing such a thing.  Mr. Morris, stop...please?!?!  For alternatives, I'd recommend the following (from basic to rigorous): Case for Christ - Lee Strobel, Christianity for Skeptics - Steve Kumar (touches on religious plurality - nice bonus!), Reasonable Faith - William Lane Craig 
 Way overrated.  L&L lacks motivation and empiricism.  Justifications behind their derivations are often specious.  If you know the subject, it's a nice perspective.  Otherwise, it's useless.  Two stars, instead of zero, for their oustanding elegance.  Based on previous raves, have read now V.1 and V.2 of their course of physics.  Doubt that i will waste time on other volumes. 
 Don't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers.  I'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 MP Nikon Coolpix SQ as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop.  What've I've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 MP images from this HP camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  The images look absolutely horrible.  My little Nikon SQ with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  Do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one 
 I would write in more detail but I would refer everyone to the review "Flawed thesis and tunnel vision: interesting dishonesty."  This is the second book I've read from Armstrong and her goal seems to be the same:  History comes second to placing Islam/Muslims/Arabs in a positive light.  
  After the excitement of THE WOLVES OF CALLA, SONG OF SUSANNAH is more than a little disappointing. Susannah and her demon possessor, Mia, are off to give birth to whatever, Roland, Eddie, Jake and Callahan are in hot, well, lukewarm pursuit, and for many pages nothing happens. Many, Many pages. This book plays to the worst parts of the series, overly mannered speeches, cryptic messages, 19's all over the place and page upon page of meaningless dialogue that will interest only fans of minutia. There are a few moments where things pickup, like when King himself makes an appearance, and while it proves  interesting for King to take such a hard look at his 70's self, it's not exactly Kilgore Trout meeting Vonnegut in BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Another problem I had was that unlike the clear and horrifying creations of Wrightson and Whalen, Anderson's blurry impresionistic images left me cold and did nothing to enhance this volume of THE DARK TOWER. For the second to last book in the series I had hoped for some real resolutions to some of the problems, but I guess King decided to save everything for the last book.   P.S. Man, if I heard that baby called "the chap" one more time... 
 I couldn't believe this is the author of "The Naked and the Dead", "Harlot's Ghost", and "The Executioner's Song"!  I think for this book Mailer tried a little too hard to be "cool", "stylistic", whatever, and ended up looking like an unconvincing show-off.  Not worth the trouble 
 I started reading 'The no.1 Ladies Detective Agency' but could never really get into it. I liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go. Sadly, although the book has some funny moments (Bertie's tantrums!)it never really gripped me. I love Scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider' comments. The book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to..?' and 'what was the point of?'.  On the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with Edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did 
 I didn't find this funny, satirical or humourous in any way. Poor drivel and a waste of time and brain matter 
 This book was not helpful.  It gave you ideas on how to save that were common sense.  For example, cut down the guest list.  Dah!!! That is obvious, the less people the less expensive.   
 What a disaster. Stay away from this film. I was so disappointed--how could this have won the Academy Award?! The story is rambling and confused, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what story they wanted to tell. The animation is very average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes. In fact, those all-important "happy feet" of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit. (That's supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be "animation?") The jokes aren't particularly funny (with the exception of a few moments in the middle where Robin Williams briefly shines). And oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing, there's not a single original song, or even an inspired remake of any of the songs. Think "Billy Elliot" meets "The March of the Penguins" with some  of Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" mixed in--without any of the wit, charm, intelligence, passion, or beauty in any of those films. (Did I mention that this film is a disaster?)  Perhaps most annoyingly, like the rest of the story, the underlying political message alternates between cliched, confused, and heavy-handed. The ending is especially unbearable, with its tacked-on feel and absurd psuedo-environmentalist feel-good solution. What a joke! Personally, I consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions (I've been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, and a member of Sierra Club and PETA, for example), yet the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me greatly--not least because of the utter inconsistency and incomprehensibility of the message.  One final note for those of you with children: this is not really a kids movie. Most of the jokes won't be understood by children under 15. For kids under 6, all this feeble film offers is some too-scary "Shamus" (orcas), a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth, and a jarring ending that suddenly switches to live-action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid-friendly forums as the United Nations! (What the heck?!) After sitting through the entire film to this point, my four-year-old son finally turned to me and quietly said, "This is not a movie for me."  I couldn't have agreed more 
 The arrangements in this book are maddeningly inaccurate. They range from boring to bad. If you're a fan of Beatles composition, chords and harmonies you'll be very disappointed 
 If you are a casual Cheap Trick fan, don't buy this DVD. The sound quality is poor and the performances are uninspired. Even the great Bun E Carlos seems to be just "going through the motions." After seeing an inspired Cheap Trick show in person back in the early 80s, this DVD depicts a mere shadow of the former band that I knew back then. If you are a hard-core Cheap Trick fan, it won't be  total bust, but I wasn't happy with it. If I'm going to shell out money for these DVDs, I'd expect a lot more than what I got in this case. 
 I am a fan of Shillington and I expected more from this book. His effort to glorify African leaders and condemn Europeans makes this text biased and inaccurate. I would recommend Blaine Harden's "Africa: Dispatches from a Fragile Continent.&quot 
 I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.   Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.  There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden 
 Like most reviewers, I grew up with this book and loved it as a child.  However, even then I had one question:  why call him "Little BLACK Sambo"?  Why not just "Little Sambo"?    Many reviewers here have defended this book against the charges of racism.  One guy even goes so far as to say if you think it's racist you hate other cultures.  I don't have a clue as to what that is supposed to mean, but this book is racist.  Just is.  However, instead of saying "is" or "is not", I'm actually going to explain my opinion.    This book was written by a Scottish woman living in India in 1899.  The original illustrations, presumably replicated in this edition, feature Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo as having inky black skin and big red lips.  Subsequent American volumes had drawing of the characters in blackface.  As a result of these exaggerated illustrations, the word "Sambo" became a racial slur in America directed at African-Americans.    Now, as another reviewer noted, this is set in India, not Africa.  I'm not sure how that is meant to excuse the book, but I'm guessing that since the word Sambo was directed as a slur against African-Americans, we can safely chock that up to a misreading of the book by Americans.  Not so.  A glimpse at the history of race, and specifically "blackness" will show that Indians, Africans, and even the Irish were considered "black".  "Black" in this sense meaning both a physical characteristic as well as a way of saying "other than Anglo".  It was a claim also that was disparaging to their "perceived" level of sophistication as human beings.  As such, words such as the "n-word" (I won't spell it out since this is a page for a kid's book) were levelled at Africans and Indians (and Irishmen) equally.  It stands to reason, then, that "Sambo" was a derrogatory term lobbed at all who were looked upon as savage, different, or unequal to "white" folks.  This cannot be ignored, nor excused.  Ms. Bannerman's Sambo stories have historically done a lot of damage, and even added a racial slur to American speech.  This is not just, as one person says, over-sensitive adults overreacting.  If you are an African-American and have been called a "sambo" it's hardly overreacting to take offense.  This book, historically, has had a place in the canon of racist western literature, and no amount of charm the story has can change this unfortunate fact 
 I wore the boots one time and it will be the only time. The boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable. The material is so hard and did not give. I even wore socks and that did not help. I would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort 
 Poorly written, poorly researched -- it's as if the writer had tried put together a great work of art from torn bits of cocktail napkins... and had a hard time filling in the gaping spaces between 
 I just ran my first (and last) cd through the Scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when I started.  Didn't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own.  It really is worse than when I started.  
 After the first 11 books, that were laced with black comedy and inopportune situations handled and aligned in a way to make sense, the 12th books somehow leaves the reader gasping for more and ends with a flat note. I can, however, find cognizance with the moral of the story that sometimes people you think you are close to, fail you with their "nobleness" or lack of guts! That you have to find strength in yourself to fight your own wars and that a family has an important part to play when you're struggling through your live. I think the gist of the story is that that the three children find succor in each other - almost a live force driven by love, that protects them and eventually helps to extricate them from impossible situations! 
 There are dozens and dozens of pictures showing what you could make with paper, pencil, and exacto knife, but the instructions were minimal and only for the simple projects. Beautiful examples are shown throughout the book, but no instructions on how to make them. Having patterns for the more intricate projects would definitely help out. It's an okay book to learn the basic, but lacking for advanced designs.  The Title "Step by Step Instructions" is very misleading 
 I don't get it-  so many honest people struggle to stay in business each day, but these guys are still going. The sad part is, this machine would be good if it actually worked for more than 2 weeks. I want to say it sucks, but that's the whole problem... it doesn't. 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 The labels are sticky on one side, and printable on the other, but that's about all this product has going for it.  The software is a nightmare.  The print previews only vaguely represent the finished product, and the program frequently and randomly alters your image.  I wound up using the labels, but creating the documents in MS publisher.  what a shame 
 This book is an insult to the women and men who fought so hard against sexism, racism , militarism and the other ugly aspects of corporate America during the 1960's, 70s, 80s, 90s and beyond. It is an invitation to affluent spoiled brats to get their share of a pie produced by garment workers in Bangladesh and Mexican cleaning ladies and feel good about it at the same time; after all, when you get your share of the goodies you are really being a feminist, beating men at their own game. Reasoning like this could be used to justify rising to the top in the Mafia or the CIA.      At one point Wolf claims that "we" would wage war to stop atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. Funny, I don't remember hearing about her enlisting when war really came. Perhaps that kind of thing is for lower class women (and men) who don't fit into her bourgois pseudo-feminist scheme.       I saw Wolf's name listed on a "Learning Annex" ad with pop psychologist Wayne Dyer, various get rich quick frauds, dubious instructors who will teach you how to break into acting, and similar characters. Nice company she's keeping these days. I guess that's called fighting fire with fire 
 My subscription for 2006 was up and I needed to renew - since I just reinstalled Windows XP Professional (SP2) on my laptop (a Dell Inspiron 9300, Intel Pentium M 2GHz, 512MB RAM, 60GB Hard Disk), I decided to simply purchase the 360.  I have been having issues with the Live Update for several weeks now (Error 5).  Instead I have to download a 15 MB file ever so often with the updated definitions.  After checking the technical support website, it appears that Norton is aware of the problem and is currently working on it.  That was just about two weeks ago.  Customer support is non-existent it appears since I have yet to be contacted.  Complete waste of time.  Renew your existing subscriptions instead.  I wish that I had 
 COMPETED SO MUCH WITH THE SPOKEN WORD.  I wouldn't be able to reccomend this for bed time at all as you have to listen SO hard to hear the words that it becomes very "unrelaxing".  However if you chose to  listen to this during the day this would probably work for you 
 Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  I am not one of them.  Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction.  I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche.  If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed.  
 President Ulysses Grant called the 1846 U.S. invasioin of Mexico, "the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation."  I see whatever piece of the "American Dream" that immigrants (legal or not) get from coming here as a sort of reparations for all the harm our military empire has caused other nations.  Pat Buchanan has said, "if people don't want terrorism, we have to give up our empire."  I think he's right, I'd just add that the same goes for immigration.  To curb the influx of economic refugees, we have to reform NAFTA, end the exploitative behavior of transnationals (many US-based) in the maquilladoras, support Fair Trade, end the dirty work of places like the School of the Americas and figures like "Economic Hit Men," and so forth.  Moreover, Wooldridge and others often speak as if the "Minute Men" are the only civic group working on the issue of immigration.  Thankfully, there are groups like the American Friends Service Committee and Border Links that have a much more intelligent analysis of migration, and far more humane approaches to this complex issue.  As General Smedley Butler said, "war is a racket," and that includes this war on immigrants.  There is a lot of money that is being made from the building of a high-tech fence, aerial drones, motion sensors, videocameras, detention centers, and the other equipment of a police state.  If we let that industry grow because of one scare or another . . . well, we won't recognize this country as the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Rather than Wooldridge's fear and resentment-mongering, I'd recommend the upcoming boook by Free Speech Radio News host, Deepa Fernandes, which is titled, "Targeted: Homeland Security and the Business of Immigration."  We could also learn a lot by listening to the leaders of Mexico's own movements for justice.  There are many books and DVDs available regarding the courageous efforts of the Zapatistas.  "I would rather die on my feet, than live a lifetime on my knees."  -Emiliano Zapata 
 Mr. Bennett shows a sad, vindictive streak in this book, which I had not expected from him.  He acts as if the whole point of politics is to win debates, using whatever vitriol necessary to score points, with no regard  for civility or morality.  It is nice to see that for all his  liberal-bashing in this text, he found better ground in the future, for in  his book on virtues he explicitly makes the point that good, moral people  can be liberals or conservatives.   If you can ignore the rampant hatred,  he makes some decent points.  The section on drug policy is a great read,  much nicer than his assault on teacher unions when he supposedly is writing  about education.    I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone, though  it has some positive features.  There are more open-minded and insightful  political writers out there, like Michael Lind, Richard John Neuhaus or Jim  Wallis.  Let's not confine ourselves to the angry complaints of a bureacrat  like Bennett 
 Leafing through every page of this famous book, I found it utterly useless for anyone who's vegetarian. Four of the meatless recipes were useful, though not particularly appealing in terms of taste. 
 I received this free from Sephora as a birthday present because I signed up as a Beauty Insider.  I gave it to my neice for her 7th birthday and she likes it, but there's no reason this product should cost $16.  I'm betting the ingredients, packaging & shipping costs don't total more than $3.  I wouldn't buy it.  
 My husband who is off fighting for the Constitution sent this book to our daughter.  If he had not sent it, I would want a refund.  My daughter and I sat down to read the book together.  She thought the drawings did not match the words and thought the author still did not like the Preamble. (HE makes mention in the begining that he was forced to think about the Constitution). There was no inspiration from this book and she hasn't picked it up again.  The pictures are not exciting to children and only vaguely connect to the words.  She loves the Freedom Rock version of the Preamble and and really enjoys Lynn Chaney's "America A Patriotic Primer", so I understand why he made the purchase, however it is not inspiring or uplifting or interesting 
 Mxpx were solidly putting out great albums. They were in between an underground and mainstream band for a little while. I mean they're on a major label but their songs dont get played that much on the radio and they don't sell millions of albums. They probably sell almost as much as Nofx, pennywise, no use for a name bands like that. This album is better than the new piece of crap they put out a year ago but man not by much, this is actually going away from their punk roots and into more just straight up rock n roll like foo fighters. there are some good songs on here but there are alot of songs that sound the same and are startinig to sound kinda whiny. Mxpx is on a hunt to sell out so buy as many of their records as possible so they can start putting out better albums even though i don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon 
 It was revealed by GLORIA STEINEM, quite soon after the untimely death of JACCQULINE KENNEDY ONASSIS, that Ms. KENNEDY had, very quitely and unobtusively, been contributing substatial amounts of money to N.O.W. for many, many years.  Now, (!), most people would not have thought that Jackie -- glamourous, gracious, and perennially-on-the-best-dressed-lists Jackie -- would have been one to support a "right-on, with-it" and somewhat aggressive organization such as "N.O.W."....but you see, she probably was a "women's liberationist" from Day 1 of her life.  Born into the social strata that she had been, it would have been rather difficult for her to, say, join the protests of Ceasar Chauvez in the vegetable fields, or go marching with Martin Luther King.  Yet her heart -- as well as that of her husband's -- were in these places 100%!   What to do?  She found the best way, (for her), to contribute: maintain the "social" facade, increase her wealth.....and then, unobtrusively, give it to those causes in which she truly believed!   There are, indeed, far more than one way to "skin a cat"....and/or change society!  However, an extremely handsome, extremely intelligent young man of my own  acquaintance, who enjoys perfect health, had a perfect score on his SATs, who attended a top-40 private college, has a beautiful wife and precocious child, and probably a fantastic future ahead of him if he so wishes), once told me, "But no one has ever discouraged ME!"  Perhaps.  (Does he know, I wonder, that one of the women he, personally, admires LEAST, H.M. Queen Elizabeth II, once said, similarly, "But no one has ever discriminated against ME because I am a woman!")  Does he not realize, that there are SO many OTHER people in the world who are equally, (or even more) ambitious as he, who do NOT enjoy perfect health, did NOT, (due to circumstances beyond their control), graduate or even go to college, are NOT movie-star handome or beautiful, do NOT have many supportive relatives, (or perhaps none at all) -- and perhaps do not enjoy other advantages this young man hardly thinks about...perhaps not even owning a car.  Yet, they, too, may want to rise in life, and look about wildly for SOME way to advance themselves -- and perhaps, also, help others as well?  What can they do?  Robbing banks can get one into a lot of trouble....especially if one does not have a driver's licence and getaway car.  Working in a freak show, (there ARE some left), does not appeal to many proud people, (although one proud person---who DID work in a freak show, once said: "People come here and pay money to see me, I don't pay money to see them.  My job's OK with me!)  I suppose it's all how one views one's circumstances.   Hmmmm.....losing weight, having my hair done, and looking as well as I can?  Why not?  That's an almost-free road to almost anyone!  Become beautiful -- or at least as beautiful as I can!  Why not?????   I recently saw a TV report on three young women -- teen agers -- who have life-threatening illnesses. In the hospital as much -- - or more -- than they are out of it, each of the three qualified for the "Make-A-Wish" program.  And what was the wish these three young women had arrived at...each separately?  Their wish was to be a super-model for a day!  : )  : )  : )   Since each of the three had the same wish, they met, and went all together to the various places which would transform them into super-models for the day.  They also met and conversed with real models.  Is this wrong?  Body-image isn't everything,  (WHEN ONE BELIEVES THAT, IT'S A SICKNESS CALLED 'NARCISSISM'!)....but surely it has it's proper place.  Looking as good as one can helps to give a person a sense of self-respect!  And -- in  this admittedly imperfect world -- looking good CAN help one get ahead.  (If a pretty girl and a plain one both have the same qualifications for, say, a secretarial, (or any other) job....the pretty girl will probably get the job.  Why?  Because the employer will want to put on a "good face" for his business.  This is not to say that if a pretty girl does not groom herself well, that the plain one...who takes better care of herself...will probably get the job. For the same reason.  Because the employer wants to put on a "good face" for his business.  "Beauty is as beauty does", I suppose.  And no one proved this more than DIANA VREELAND herself.  Ms. Vreeland was NOT beautiful...in fact, her appearance verged on being just plain ugly....but she decided NOT to let this be a hindrance in her chosen profession.  She started and rose in it....and wound up as editor-in-chief of VOGUE Magazine for many years!!!!!!       I suppose what I'm arguing here for is the realistic discovery that yes, beauty DOES matter in today's world.  But trying to look as good as one can does N O T necessarily mean having a nose job or binding one's feet.  That is a personal decision each person has to make for one's self.  Looking as good as you can..and deriving confidence from this, is what counts.  And, (as was shown on an episode of "To Tell The Truth" several years ago), there is a young lady in India, who became a model....then used her earnings to open up her home to under-priviledged children.   Angelina Jolie has used her beauty and fame to help others as well.  The list of "beautiful people" doing good works is quite long.       And who would tell those three teen-age girls with life- threatening diseases that their "Make-A-Wish" desire to become super-models for a day is unrealistic, backward, and hedonistic? Not I.  Beauty makes people HAPPY!  And there is little enough happiness in the world as it is!       "Beauty for good".....for anyone who chooses it!......forever!!!!!! 
 I had read glowing reviews about this book and was very eager to begin reading it.  What a disappointment!  The heroine is uninspired, the writing is abysmal, and the plot never seems to move anywhere.  I love soap operas and couldn't wait for the "juicy" reveals about soaps that the book previews promised. Overall, I was incredibly bored by the novel.  Let me illustrate it this way.  I always read every page of every book before making up my mind about it.  With this one, I stopped about a fourth of the way.  Your time would be better spent watching an episode of "All My Children. 
 I found this razor as the same as the other ones. Don't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one. The only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose, et 
 No Spoilers  Where to start. This could easily turn into a long review, but I don't want it to be so I'll try to keep it short. Also, I'll stay away from the religious views regarding this book and focus on the writing because religion is subjective and everyone can (and should) think whatever they want about their religion) Having said that, the one recurring thought I had about this book while reading it (and while thinking about it after completing it for this review) was that it is without a doubt the most esoteric and pedantic book I have ever read.   Now I'm not stupid, and I can appreciate the beauty of words and the importance of diction, but so much of this book was Rushdie writing in such a way to make sure that you had no idea what the hell he was talking about. There are times when you can be extremely metaphorical and lofty and times when you should just be blunt, but for Rushdie, there is no bluntness, and everything must be doused in the most stringy and free-formed words he can think of. Why? In some cases it adds to the story... in this, it doesn't. While there are some very good parts in this book, they are all surrounded by a lot of words that don't really say anything.  Bottom line: you can skip this book. However, those interested in religion and questioning said relgion will probably read it anyway. I would suggest you get a durable copy because you will want to throw it against the wall a few times.  PS: The best part of the whole book for me was towards the end in the scenes between Saladin and his father. If the whole book had been written like that, it would've been a pleasure 
 If you like hard science fiction, I would recommend trying Permutation City and Diaspora by Greg Egan instead. Another book more similar to Eon but far more readable is "Rendezvous with Rama" by Arthur C. Clarke (not the sequels). Greg Bear wasn't able to convey the sense of wonder of the situation he describes, in fact, sometimes I have found very hard to understand his descriptions, as others reviewers say (not because of their technicallity, but simply because they are sometimes very convoluted). Also, part of the plot seems outdated, be aware that this book was published in 1985 (USSR, Cold War...). I haven't been able to read past a third of the book, so this review may be a bit biased ; 
 This book is not meant for self study. This book is too theoretical, and it does not give enough basic examples. It is too abstract. I do not recommend this book to anyone 
 What is the point?   Team this film with the over-rated, Lost In Translation, and you have a five hour journey into total boredom..For five hours Bill Murray wanders about with a sad St.Bernard look on his face accomplishing nothing and saying nothing of value..One could call these two films,Odes To Self Pity...Not ALL souls are lost! There are many people creating great things, making wonderful contributions and being very funny at the same time and the people really want to see their stories instead these artsy, farsty downers...Every year Hollywood keeps losing 7 to 10% of its audience ...and these are two of the reasons People really don't want to spend money to hang out with self absorbed losers with no point to their lives...Where are the Frank Capras, Preston Sturges, Stanley Kramers, George Stevens...we Need Them..Jack Schlatte 
 The TV show Are You Being Served? has to be one of my all time favorites, and I believe it truly is the funniest British comedy ever on TV.  However, the movie was lacking. As I first started watching this movie, while they were still in the shop, I noticed that something was lacking, that something about it felt empty.  It was the lack of a laugh track.  Now, in all honesty, most of the time I prefer there not be a laugh track, but in Are You Being Served, a laugh track is essential.  Without the laugh track, the comedic timing of the show was thrown off from the start. Then, as they get into the movie, the jokes aren't new, and the conflict is predictable and leaves you yearning for it to be over. If you are a huge fan of AYBS and want to have the complete collection, that is the only reason I would suggest buying this.  It is the only reason I bought it, and the only value I see in it.  There is definitely little (if any) entertainment value 
 i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!?  i mean, they're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see!  how hard is that!?  Halo is an awesome game but it's REALLY not hard to figure out what to do!  i mean you'd have to be a complete MORON not to know what to do or where to go.  it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying Cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop, tellin' ya what to do.  but anyway i'm done ranting at you wusses 
 although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead 
 But yes, Brooks and Dunn are getting worse.  They lost me as a fan with Steers and Stripes and I haven't heard anything on this album to win me back 
 A third of this book is devoted to basic computer concepts that can be learned elsewhere(and better). The garden part is a collection of freeware, shareware, and sample programs many DOS based. Not worth the mone 
 I read so many good reviews of this book that I had to get it for the Halloween season. It begins with an interesting and mysterious premise but soon evolves into pages of story with little excitement. I am at the last 5o pages of the book and perhaps I will find out why everyone else found this book so good. An antique book seller and his daughter operate a dusty old shop with valuable books. The daughter is invited by one of the top authors of the day to write her biography although she has been a recluse and resists others attempts to find out the truth of her life. The common thread between the author and biographer is that they are both twins. I am married to an identical twin and I am baffled by the excessive concentration on this one topic. Wait for it to go on the discount table 
 Another greatest hits debacle.  For the most part, this is their best stuff but where's Mistral Wind?  It was a favorite of the band, fans and radio.  
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 This release drew the line for me with Aerosmith. There music on this and the following material up to date contain complete chaos.  Aerosmith lost their rhythmn they once possessed on the prior four cds that were all five-star efforts.  This album along with the latter day Aerosmith stuff is just noisey as far as I am concerned. I have the first four releases (Aeromsith, Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic and Rocks all 5*****), but they no longer impress me except maybe for a track here and there.  Or maybe I am just old 
 This was the first edition of this book that I bought, and it is almost completly unreadable. Granted this is a budget book; however, the quality is completly lacking. If you are going to buy this book, which you should, it is an excellent peice in understanding More's society, I recomend the Penguin edition 
 What a dreadful "rip-off" this "historical" set is.  While the selections are vast, the copies are sooooo shoddy, the colors soooo shifted and shifting, that whatever was exciting about these flixs of my childhood has disappeared totally.  As far as "Digitally Remastered" is concerned--false--they just set the worst 16mm prints in a Telecine and let them run.  No color correction, no light/darkness adjustment, and, certainly, no removal of cuts, bleeps, dirt, scratches, etc., etc, etc.  I'm seed my set off to "Badwill". Purchase the new DVDs that are slowly becoming available like the new Hercules in widescreen.  Great color and correct aspect ratio! 
 Not a very good book for the real worl 
 Ordinarily, I would not take the time to write a review, but if I could get my money and time back for having purchased and read this book, I would.  I love Terry Jones' work, along with the rest of the Pythons, and I was excited when the book arrived. I expected something entertaining, and at least insightful, but what I got was one rant, retold a dozen slightly different ways.  It's all based on one web site spelling out some possible right wing conspiracy, and the fact that one web site is cited again and again...and again makes me wonder what the publishers thought they had to work with? At the very least, *do not* pay full retail price for this turkey, buy it used or check it at the library 
 I order'd this vacuum after reading other reviews.   One hour after placing my order I happened to find the identical vacuum @ a Target store and was extremely disappointed with its quality.  I came home immediately to cancel my order.  I spoke with two customer service reps and was told that I would receive an e-mail within 24 hours to confirm the order was suspended after notification was sent to shipping.    Twenty four hours later, I rec'd an e-mail notifying me that the vacuum had been shipped.  I was very upset at this news, as I had purchased this item as a gift to be sent to someone who is not capable of handling such transactions on her own and I now had to suffer the inconvenience, frustration and embarrasment of handling the mistake with her and the shipping carrier.  Usually, I am thrilled at the speed of service from Amazon with all other transactions.  I just wish there was more than a two hour window for cancellations 
 Just what was wrong with being the bass player for one of the greatest classic rock bands? Was it Cher? Dude, snap out of it! What would your mother say 
 If you're lookiing for valuable insight into how great businesses were conceived and executed this is not the book for you. Each business is given only a few pages of what essentially amounts to fluff. Most of the information is anecdotal in nature and rarely goes beyond the sort of superficial treatment one might get in People magazine. The articles reminded me of something a high school student might turn in as a short essay assignment. The roster of companies chosen is rather suspect. There is disproportionate representation by the cosmetics and fashion industries. I think that every company that sells makeup is covered here. Many of the other selections are some of the more glamorous and obvious success stories. C'mon, we ALL know the MicroSoft story by now. I was also puzzled by the lack of variety in the writing. Time and time again profit is referred to as "turnover", going public is referred to as "floating", a line of products is called a "range" -- was this book edited? I cannot recommend this book for business persons. It may be appropriate for a young person who has not been exposed to these canned legends before. 
 This book would be really wonderful for kids who are going through a divorce where their daddy is a louse.  The book portrays the father as a deadbeat who doesn't bother to show up for visitations even though he only has them one night a week.  What does this book say that a divorce is?  "A divorce meant that Daddy would not live with Mama, Ruth, and Dinah anymore." I know how impressionable kids are, how is this supposed to be an unbiassed view of divorce?  In my mind this book is designed to taint the mind of impressionable children to make them wonder whether their daddy was going to treat them with the same carelessness as Daddy Bear.  I would warn fathers who find themselves in a divorce to think carefully before allowing their children to read this book 
 Iles tries to imitate Michael Crichton with bits of Dan Brown's Digital Fortress in this book.  Unfortunately this book does not make it.  The NSA is backing a project called Trinity which is to develop a super quantum computer that is controlled by a brainscan of a human mind.  Two of the individuals involved with the project want it halted and one dies in an apparent stroke which was actually induced by the NSA bad guys (why does the NSA always have to be portrayed as the bad guys in these books?).  David Tennant is the other individual and he gets away by stopping an unstoppable hitman and then persuades his psychiatrist to run with him, even though she thinks he is mentally unstable.  The plot really gets out of hand with Tennant having visions of being Jesus, being portrayed to the Secret Service as the next Oswald and escaping the entire Washington DC police and SWAT units and ultimately getting out the country with a false passport, going to Israel and then persuading the head of the Moussad to help him.  As crazy as it sounds the end is literally unbelievable that would even make a James Bond fan cringe.  The author has written some great tense books (24 Hours, Sleep No More) so I just chalk this one up to an experiment gone awry. 
 They were on sale, and I ordered 2. They arrived separately in two HUGE boxes - via UPS - and looked like they had both been dropped from about 10 stories up. Sigh... The mats themselves had broken and cracked rubber backing. I guess they got beaten up in transit. The actual pattern in the mats is beautiful and the fiber is nice and dense. So - I kept them. They are outside and hopefully they won't fall apart too quickly.  If you are really picky, you better take a good look at these when they are delivered 
 CoT is a rather disjointed attempt at a historical narrative that I strongly suspect was culled from a dozen or so different journals from settlers. This is not well done history and a rather tiresome read. I found it amazing that there was almost no discussion of the culture or way of life of the aborigines. The discussion of the English settlers seems to focus on sex and punishment. What about the organization of the colony? How did the colonists manage their day-to-day lives to survive those first worst years?  For anyone who has a serious interest in history, CoT misses the mark by a wide margin. Not recommended 
 "Checken Soup for the Soul" contains a series of short stories where horrible and depressing things happen. And then the story ends.  Each story contains an act of kindness, but the main focus is a sad, depressing, or horrible situation.  For example, a crippled boy chooses a crippled puppy to be his pet; and a young boy dies of cancer surrounded by friends.  Look, if you love watching Dramas on TV, you'll adore this book.  Ditto if you like crying.  For myself, I just don't understand how this is supposed to be uplifting 
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 What a waste of time to air this up.  It developed leaks in less time to it took to enter the credit card info to order it.  This was the worst gift because it had such a high expectation but turned into the biggest disappointment.  The vinyl was so thin that rolling it over normal bermuda grass created holes from small seed pods and sticks.  Save your money.. 
 This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned 
 If you walk into B&N and flip through (not even buy!) the other "well known/recommended" pregnancy books you'll get much more information than what Douglas offers.   If you're lazy/want a quick read, this book is for you. If you're looking for a comprehensive tell-all (which the title and reviews lead you to believe), this is *not* the book for you.  This was a total waste of money! If I had know it was this bad I would have just used my money to buy diapers instead. 
 i personly along with my puritan brothers and sisters am disturbed by the falseness in this book. we do not live as it is printed. my ancesters did not either.  i wish we would stop being judged in this matter.  we are  tired of the jokes and it hurts our feelings 
 This is supposed to be a black comedy.  In fact, it is an ineptly directed, unfunny, obscene mess.  It features filthy language, the required men's bathroom scene, rape, racism, hatred of America, and ridicule of the mentally ill.  Attention all Altzheimer's patients, Reiner thinks you're hilarious.  Watch Harold and Maude or, even better, Little Murders if you want to see black comedy.  This bomb is best forgotten.  I'm not selling my DVD copy, I'm throwing it away 
 I was tired of replacing wires on my old cheese slicer every couple of years.  The blade "bends" through a block of cheese.  It doesnt provide a straight cut.  
 As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense.  While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting.  So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.    Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book 
 If you go to the list showing all of my reviews, you will see that I have read quite a few books about the stock market and trading in general. While I have encountered information that talked in generalities about the Elliott Wave Principle, I had never delved into it in much detail as I never felt the methodology was consistent. Having trudged my way through this book, I have come to the conclusion that either (1) I am too stupid to be able to understand and trade based on the EWP (an admittedly distinct possibility), or (2) I have never read so much after-the-fact 'curve fitting' in my life. If you are a student and believer in the Elliott Wave Principle, this will be like adding a second Bible to your collection. If, however, you don't already know and understand the EWP, and unless you are a genius, plan on spending years trying to understand the theory before you will be able to implement it into your trading system. Sorry, Mr. Prechter, but I just don't get it 
 Steven Dick covers a lot of interesting material in a variety of fields.  However, the author has a tendency to write extensively in the passive voice, making it very slow reading.  He also has a tendency to drop lots of  names at once.  This makes it extremely difficult to follow at times 
 Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised!  To date, I've been denied twice.  The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode!  I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted."  Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.  The product itself is average.  I've used better and worse.  That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price 
 I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft 
 I'm more than halfway through this book and I don't think I'll continue any further.  It's more like a medical dictionary of illnesses and diseases rather than a preparatory book for couples who are planning to conceive. A nice title though... but the contents were not what I expected. 
 While several books provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about other cultures, this novel is not one of them.  A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central characters, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make for quite possibly the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible, I would steer clear of this and instead pick up a copy of The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinback 
 WARNING! Do not waste your money or your time.  Sandra Bullock is not in this movie enough to warrent the packaging headling her as the star. [...]  The sound quality is really bad, as well as the lighting and if they used a script that too.  Run from this movie 
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 As a classics major in college, I have been regularly referred to the Roman section of this work to gain increased general knowledge over later classical antiquity. After thoroughly reading and rereading many sections, I can scarcely say I've gleaned anything close to that.  The "chapters" read more like non-peer reviewed articles that are virtually impossible to understand for the casual reader, and very difficult for classics students. They constantly diverge from their central theses, lack chronological sequence both within themselves and in relation to other chapters, use highly colloquial terms and accentuate seemingly arbitrary themes throughout history while ignoring others.  Cases in point: Marius' name is mentioned about 3 times, and never in regards to his own exploits. Cinna is missing entirely as far as I can tell. The Catilinarian conspiracy receives about half a paragraph (even though Sallust devoted a book to it and Cicero couldn't shut up about his own involvement), as do the Gracchi brothers, and Cato the Elder, but we receive heaps of names about obscure groups in the Italian peninsula during Rome's expansion, whose importance as individual tribes is obfuscated by varying levels of information which seem to lead nowhere, while their individual legacies are absent. The exact identities of  "Roman", "Etruscan", "Latin", and "Italian" are anyone's guess. When the political division between the "populares" and "optimati" are introduced, the latter term is left undefined. Very, very shoddy.  I have not read the Greek section yet and refrain from commenting upon it.  The Roman section of this text, I think, is a disgrace to the Oxford University Press. If you want to learn about classical history, I suggest you read an array of entries from the Oxford Classical Dictionary, a thick but condensed reference work that cuts through much of the subjective interpretation of events to the meat of the matter, giving you the "who's who" and "what's what" in concise entries 
 Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention.  I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get.  The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King.  These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close.  
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 Dear Amazon, I paid for this but until today I did not received it, I wrote to the supplier and until today I did not received any answer from him 
 I'm always looking for good mystery stories, and bought this first book in the Inspector Banks series thinking it sounded promising.  Sorry to say, I found the dialog stilted, the interactions of the characters not realistic or adult, and the women's lib angle poorly expressed.  If it werent for the violence and sex, it'd be a better read for someone in junior high school.  The professional characters, like the chief inspector and the psychologist, seem awfully inexperienced for people in those kinds of jobs.  Part of the reason it seems corny is that it doesnt stand up well after 20 years 
 This is my second posted review of The Renaissance Guide to Wine and Food Pairing. The first review was actually removed from Amazon after earning six helpful votes, allegedly because I criticized the authors so harshly that I violated the Amazon code of conduct. The review also provoked at least one other (anonymous) reviewer to call me a wine snob because I didn't agree with him/her/it. All I can say is, gee whiz, folks, it's just a book review-lighten up! Read `em all and make up your own mind. And if you think I'm some kind of crackpot wine geek because I hate this book, well, that's entirely your prerogative.    Rather than write a whole new review, I've decided to republish most of the original, though I am removing the specific phrases that offended the "Keep Amazon Beautiful Committee".    The Renaissance Guide to Wine and Food Pairing is a bad book. In fact, I was so repelled by it that I feel it  incumbent upon me as an Amazon reviewer to warn all unsuspecting readers away as though it were the scene of a gruesome accident, or at minimum a wine so bad it would make you sick just to smell it, let  alone drink it.   It's only sporting for someone to inform you that when you buy this book you aren't getting an organized and comprehensive analysis of the subject in the book's title. Instead, the first 100 pages or so discuss wine history and how to read wine labels from around the world (not a bad thing in a wine book, but why devote so much space to it here?), and the rest of the book mostly consists of transcribed interviews with famous chefs and winemakers. Each new chapter is another exercise in smug and self-congratulatory "conversations" with the winemakers and chefs (like,wow, isn't it cool we can sit around and chuckle with all these food and wine hotshots?). I encountered very little of practical value and a lot of butt-kissing. I admit I already know a little about wine, but I didn't learn a blessed thing from this book until around page 205 when it was revealed in a sidebar that the word avocado is derived from the Aztec word for testicle.   There are many good books and sections of books that have been written about marrying food and wine. Two that come immediately to mind are Wesson and Rosengarten's "Red Wine with Fish" and the food and wine chapter of the Culinary Institute of America's "Exploring Wine".  In both you will find practical and frequently imaginative principles you can employ to match wine and food.   As stated above, The Renaissance Guide is little more than a loose stitching together of interviews that center around highly esoteric menus paired up with wines provided by the authors. It would be kind to describe these chapters as self-indulgent. Suffice it to say they are what appear to be unedited transcripts, even to the point where they insert (laughter) in (parentheses) where the author "cracks a good one". I'm honestly surprised that Daniel Boulud, who is interviewed here and seems like a decent, unpretentious guy, would allow his stature as one of America's best chefs to be debased in this book.   Ok, let's get more granular. Bad writing. Atrocious editing. Multiple references to pairing with obscure wines like Lagrein (great wine, but probably unknown to 99% of the readers and not exactly carried in the run of the mill wine store) without any useful introduction. More than a hundred pages of useless filler on wine history and how to read labels that is completely irrelevant to the stated subject of the book. Hideous tables that are meant to be copied as handy references but spill randomly over three pages and contain nothing really useful. Horrible lapses and gaffes. Multiple recommendations for a food/wine match where you have no idea what the wine is or even its country of origin and without any reason why it works. And I swear I'm only getting warmed up.   The authors devote a whole "chapter" to the subject of wine and pasta. After a page or so it suddenly shifts to a region by region discussion of Italy and wines that go with their cuisines. The chapter is about 8 pages long. It covers the food and wine matches by basically describing one dish and naming one wine for each region. How the authors decide to summarily dismiss Lombardia, Liguria, Basilicata and The Marches in favor of other wine growing regions is sufficient to start another Italian civil war.  Is Lagrein more available in the US than Aglianico del Vulture or Rosso Piceno? Does it make me a wine snob because I'm asking this question, or is the book snobby for its exclusion of these exciting and vital parts of the contemporary Italian wine scene?   To give you an idea for how bad this book is, they refer to a wine on one page as Terre de Trinci Sagrantino de Montefalco, and two pages later as Terre de Rinci Sagrantino de Montalcino. You say Montefalco, I say Montalcino, let's call the whole thing off. Besides, these Italian towns and wines and stuff, it's confusing cause they all kinda sound alike. Am I right or am I wrong?(How are we supposed to have confidence in a book written by experts if they can't even keep stuff like this straight?) By the way, if you want to read a great book about Italian wine and food, try "Vino Italiano" by Bastianich and Lynch).   In my opinion (and mine only) the value in this book could be boiled down to about four pages with some judicious editing, and I've seen free newsletters from winestores that have better and more practical advice on the subject. If I were rating it on the 100 point Robert Parker scale I'd give it about a 47, which is to say it's undrinkable.   
 I bought this book sight unseen based on the positive reviews and the recommendations of others.  There is nothing wrong with the book, it has a good rating, but I just didn't like it.  First, I found the author's photos very boring.  Very low contrast (could be a problem with the printer/publisher, but if so this is still not an excuse) and just plain dull.   He has a photo of something brown and asks if it's a photo of a puddle or an arial photo.  I have no idea but whatever it is, it's not interesting or pretty to look at.  Some of his triumphs come from things like jumping up and down while taking photos of trees (result is pretty bad), zooming in and out, etc.  It's like if you gave an SLR camera to a kid and let him play with it.  Yes, we should all be as naï¿½f as kids some time and think outside the box and all that, but this book just isn't going to teach you how.  One exercise he discussed was to take an egg and photograph it in different situations.  Sounds like fun, but I was expecting a lot more from the book.  A few good things, he does talk about photography and doesn't try to sell himself and his photos.  many books are more about the author than the book itself, but not this one.    I suggest any potential buyer first look through the photos.  If you like them, buy the book.  If you don't, then pick another.  This isn't a book to be bought mail order sight unseen 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 Many of the columns were interesting . . . painting a picture of a vast right-ring conspiracy that Hillary Clinton first brought to the public discourse.  But it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete, without any interest either as themselves or as a theme.  Does anyone care about Texas state politics in 1989, or Phil Gramm's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate?  Someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete .. except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book.  Just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read 
 Kramer's latest jeremiad is available for free right on the web, so it's not necessary to spend money to read it, unless one wants to peruse the added bulk of two introductions and one afterword to pad this out as a mini-book.  Kramer's essential message is certainly true: gay men need to grow up and stop acting out - it would keep us healthier and more capable of loving. This important message is surrounded by the usual Kramer hyperbole and score-settling against the admittedly odious Ed Koch and others he doesn't like. Like a mantra Kramer tells us that gays are better than other people, whatever that means, while the title of the book certainly doesn't seem to back that up. And by gays, Kramer refers only to gay men. Lesbians already live up to the "love one another" creed he preaches, one assumes. An old testament prophet is better suited to the Evangelicals than to gay life, and while Kramer is I'm sure well-intentioned, his manner and screaming alienates. We need a better messenger 
 Someone wanted to make a buck without coming up with a new book, and I confess I bit.  OUCH! The short stories in this book are all cute, but I couldn't find one I didn't recognize: they are taken from the "oral histories" collected in the regular series, so if you are an avid fan, you have read these already. Do we really need all the "yarns" in one place?  I think they add flavor to the mysteries, and are just fluff on their own. (Supposedly there is one short that is original, but it blends right in! 
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 Ordinary looking steel mug. It does not have a lid which defeats the purpose of having doube insulation. I did not find the quality of insulation that great either. Too pricey for the features it offers. 
 I travel a lot, and I am a planner, so I am no stranger to guide books.  This is the worst guide book I have ever used.  The one positive is that it is well written and easy to understand.  But that is, truly, the only positive.      Pricing information was woefully inaccurate.  Hotels that no longer exist were listed.  Hotels that do exist weren't listed.  Multiple website URLs that are no longer live were listed.  Driving directions were not only wrong (e.g. to the Williamsburg Winery), but obviously wrong when a rudientary map was consulted.  The basic fact-checking one would expect for a current guide book had obviously not been conducted.  That leads me to blame the publisher, not the author, and as result I will never again purchase an "Insiders Guide. 
 A tiresome meander through bits & pieces of ancient history and philosophy to try to prove, once again, that there is a great effort to keep humans from realizing their potential and the secret wisdom that was revealed in former times.  Dull, pedantic and unfocused 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 I have been charged however I did not get a copy of the policy to date. 
 I found the book "A Gathering of Days" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me. 
 This book is flat out too long.  The author's argument is simple.  So simple, in fact, that this would have made an excellent journal article.  Instead, the author drags it out, and drags, and drags, and drags and...  you get the idea.  Read the book reviews instead.  You'll save yourself a few hours 
 If you are serious about learning Japanese then don't buy this book. Many of the pronunciations are written using romanji in combination with Kana. It is more of a distraction than an aid. Learning with romanji will only hurt your progress later. It may give you a jump start at first, but it is just a waste of time. If you really want to learn Japanese then do yourself a favor and learn the Hiragana and Katakana. Honestly it is much easier than it looks and will pay off in the long run 
 This book was a real disappointment to me.  Unlike "The Table Saw" book by Kelly Mehler, which is great - this router book is poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly illustrated.  If you're looking for a book to explain router basics, this isn't it.  The book appears to be a collection of rather advanced articles written for a woodworking magazine, cobbled together (poorly) with a few intro chapters slapped on the front.  After the lousy intro chapters, for example, the next one is on how to build your own router bit case.  A nice little advanced project for the experienced woodworker, but hardly an appropriate "first project."  The first half of The Table Saw book, in contrast,  very clearly explains and shows you how to set up the full variety of basic cuts, and discusses the pros and cons of the techniques.  Not this one, it'll leave you totally guessing.  While I may not be a veteran woodworker, I know a good how-to book when I see one, and how valuable one can be if done at least reasonably well.  This book fails on all counts 
 I have found that most tribute albums are lame and why not just listen to the original.  So when I first heard about the project of a tribute to Grover Washington ,  I thought how do you cover God, because Grover was like a God to contemporary jazz.  WOW! What an album! OK, nobody had to write any songs on this, but they all put their own spin on each song and did a fabulous job.  Jason Miles produced this fresh off two grammy nominees for his 2000 release tribute CD to Ivan Lins ( Sting won for his version of "She Walks This Earth" while Grover was nominateed for "Cameleo " ).  First the lineup is just stellar: Regina Belle , Gerald Albright, Russ Freeman, Ronnie Laws with Sounds Of Blackness, Herbie Mann, Tom Schuman and Jeff Mironov, Dave Koz, Everette Harp, Steve Cole, George Duke, Mark Whitfield, Richard Elliot, Jay Beckenstein with Dean Brown, Paul Taylor with Peter White, Chuck Loeb with Dave Mann, Chaka Khan, Greg Philinganes with the New York Philharmonic String Section, and Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Joe Sample with Joey Defrancesco.  If you'd pick up an album with all of these guys on it and it wasn't all Grover tunes you'd buy it! In fact you'd probably have a huge grin on your face and tell half the store about your lucky find on the way to the cash register. So now imagine all these guys playing their version of all these great Grover tunes like: "Just The Two Of Us" , "Winelight", " East River Drive" , "Inner City Blues ", " Come Morning " , " Let It Flow" and more.  I can see you smiling and saying yeah I'd buy it and you should. " To Grover , With Love " is magnificent . It's good. It's great.  It's deadly gorgeous !!   
 All I can say is, some lunatic at my school thought that a bunch of 9th graders would be able to read, understand, and write about this book 
 The principle question that arises from a reading of "Soul by Soul" by Walter Johnson is why was this book written? It is touted as history, yet not only does it lack any original historical material, it  also lacks any discernable historical facts. Rather than history,  "Soul by Soul" seems to be a mean-spirited, emotional tract  designed to promote two fundamental ideas: 1. that white people living in  the antebellum South were universally loathsome, brutish and cruel and 2.  that black people living in the antebellum South were universally noble,  good and abused. To support his views, Professor Johnson strings together a  loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist  literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings. His personal  contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche  of the book's long deceased characters and divine their true, but unspoken,  motives and thoughts. Quite a feat for any historian!      One loses count  of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using  their "probing fingers" in this book. Fortunately, in between  probes, the reader can be shocked by the "killing fields of the lower  South," the "historical sexualization of black bodies," the  "slaveholders' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of  their slaves," and the "brutish perogatives of whiteness."  This is heavy, hate-filled stuff worthy of a TV mini-series but it is out  of place in a supposedly serious history text.       I live in a former  slave quarter in New Orleans. In the antebellum period, this building and  its resident slaves were, interestingly enough, owned by a free black who  was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation. As an  amateur historian, I would have thought that a book about the New Orleans  slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these  markets. What were their addresses? What percentage of their customers were  black? What percentage were white? How many slaves did the typical New  Orleans household have? How were they fed and clothed? What were their  working hours? These are basic questions that should have been addressed  but instead, the reader is given an emotionally charged, repetitious,  boring rehash of tired, previously published material. In short, this book,  for the most part, reads like a rambling, overly long sermon. Anyone  seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look  elsewhere and should consider reading the "Slave Narratives"  compiled by the Federal Writers Project, "Time on the Cross" by  Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman and "The Slave Trade" by Hugh  Thomas. The first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves  performed by the W.P.A. in the 1930's. The latter two works contain  original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery, not  the emotions 
 I have read Dilip Hiro's other books, which I am a big fan of, and this one is terrible. It is totally biased against America. It seems that Hiro is questioning Bin Laden's and Al Qaeda's involvement in the 9/11 events. He also seems to have a soft spot in his heart for the Taleban regime, and defends them for not turning over Bin Laden to the US.    The historical background he gives on the different nations and religion of the region is excellent and well written. When the book gets into the time of the 20th century and later, it seems that Hiro sides with the radicals, or makes excuses for their actions.  America and the West are not perfect, and are part of the cycle of violence in the middle east, but to totally dicredit all of our policies and actions is rediculous. I do not recommend this book, unless you like Al Qaeda and the Taleban 
 i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they're funny.  heh, so witty.  anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy, but there are a couple of good songs on this cd........notably grand theft autumn and saturday.  those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho...2 stars 
 This blender has been emitting a motor-burning smell since the day I got it. I thought it would go away, but it has only gotten worse. Definitely does not do what it says it does, all speeds perform the same. What a waste of money! 
 Sure enough, I tried to get away cheap, and got bit in the you-know-where for it.  Three months after buying it, the card is unusable.  The lifetime guarantee?  You need the original packaging and receipt.  I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all, but hey, it was a well reviewed $20 card, right?  So now it's a holiday, with everyplace closed, and I have no flash card.  You get what you pay for 
 Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."  These guys were just the beneficiaries of Rolling Stone/elitist rock critic propaganda. (And to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh!) I think Martin Newell put it best when he called the Band "dreadful bearded ghastliness." 
 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 The concept of the book is interesting, and the writing is at times compelling.  But taken on the whole, the book merits a so-so rating.  Read something better if you can find it -- and there are plenty -- read this one if you can't find anything good 
 This is just one of those dvd's you wouldn't mind renting for family night with the kids. It's not scary or entertaining except for maybe (emphasis on maybe) She Bear. The reason this may be considered funny is because it's so lame. Like one of those B-movies that is so badly done that you can't help but laugh 
 I certainly do hope one of these days that Maxim magazing will get women who are small-breasted equal time.  That's all I have to say 
 I was very disapointed with this book. It seems the author is very fond of talking, but forgets to make conclusions, and is essentially going nowhere. There is no "red line" throughout the book. But let me be more specific. My problems with this book are :  1 : The author spends about 70% of the book talking about the sorroundings of Rennes-le-Chateau, telling us about lots of small villages and paths. But there is no map in the book!!! This makes it impossible to follow the author unless you actually live in the area.  2 : The model mentioned in the title only occupies the last 30 pages. This is a shame, because it seems that this is where the author has some superior knowledge.  3 : There is a lack of structure in the book. It seems like a conversation has been written in form of a book.   My conclusion(!!) : Buy this if you own all other books on Rennes-le-Chateau. It has some speciel knowledge. But otherwise avoid it 
 This book is tortorous to read. I'm reading it for a class i currently have and i have to say i'm probably never going to pick it up agian. the whole book is like one big run on sentence with small breaks now and then. its got no order, i feel like it jumps around. not a good read. I'd discourage anyone from buying it. unless you like run on sentences 
 Theory wise, the book exposes things relatively well.  However, I cannot get over how thoroughly maddening it is to be second-guessing the answers in the back of the book when you're trying to learn by doing.  For ...sake, it's the 3rd edition and it's still full of errors!  Inexcusable!  There's no way to build confidence in problem solving when many of the solutions to the odd numbered problems are wrong!  No matter how clear the theory, it's still a work in progress, incomplete at best.  It is, quite frankly, shameful to be passing this book off as some sort of learning tool 
 I had high hopes for this book. There are too many parts that feel self-serving and pointless. I felt like I was reading the author's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation. The material on IDEO could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader. I found the preface by one of the author's former professors to be the best part of the book. I would not recommend buying this book 
 The Light of Other Days, ostensibly co-authored by Arthur C. Clarke, is marketed as a philosophically intriguing tale of the transformation of Earth society in the not-so-distant-future, upon the advent of a remote viewing technology that removes all pretense of privacy from people's lives, and even allows observing events in the past. This is an enticing premise, but it's all downhill from page 1. In fact, the premise is all that's left after you discard the juvenile writing style, the paper-thin plot, the one-dimensional characters, and the Discover magazine-grade science.  I actually gave up on it halfway through, after enduring chapter after chapter of egregious exposition. Relentless, finger-wagging infodumps in dialogue and newscasts read like the following (paraphrased, but not the least bit exaggerated): "'As you know, David, the warning signs of global warming went unheeded way back in the early 2000s, and now there's a permanent El Niño.' 'Why yes, Kate, not only is England, which had to become the 52nd U.S. state after international trade collapsed, locked in ice, but more than 60% of the earth's land is no longer farmable.'" The most blatant morality plays in Star Trek aren't even this bad. These passages are also buffered by a superfluous sex scene that tries to appeal to women, but was clearly written by a man.  And then there's this gem of dialogue, at which point the book cannot be taken any less seriously: "It's like what happened to the copyright laws with the advent of the Internet. You remember that? ... No, you're too young. The Global Information Infrastructure--the thing that was supposed to replace the Berne copyright convention--collapsed back in the nought-noughts. Suddenly the Internet was awash with unedited garbage. Every damn publishing house was forced out of business, and all the authors went back to being computer programmers, all because suddenly somebody was giving away for free the stuff they used to sell to earn a crust."  Yeah, 2001 or Rendezvous With Rama this is not; it's nowhere near the quality of Clarke's own masterworks, or any others in the genre, for that matter. That said, though, had this been marketed as a teen/preteen volume, I think it would be tolerable. However, I expected far more sophistication from an adult work, especially one with Clarke's name on it. Save your cash and wait for the TV movie 
 Unfortunately, this book does a poor job of bridging a gap in marital therapy self-help books. It seems a pity that there is little, if any, information out there covering the territory between books on how to save your marriage and those on how to divorce. Thus, I had high hopes to get a fresh perspective when ordering this book. What a disappointment. The basic idea of a planned separation is an interesting one, and probably helpful in some (perhaps many) situations. But this book is so poorly written that it takes a strong stomach indeed to wade through it. Filled with cutesy acronyms and psychobabble jingles, be sure to have a barf bag nearby. And the book sorely needs reworking by a competent editor to pare down her blatant and transparent self-promotion. Seinfeld could do a great episode lampooning the author- she comes through as a pathetically insecure person who can't separate her needs from those of her patients. More space is wasted on her bragging than practical (or even theoretical) advice. If her painfully self-referential style and anecdotes had some substance it would be OK, but one ends up feeling like the person deriving the most benefit from the book is the author. Perhaps the only one. But It's even more frightening to think of her attempting to function as a therapist. Scary. Somebody stop her before she writes again 
 This book is an A to Z of fitness, in short form.  It explains concepts and healthy living principles and is probably good for the uninitiated.  It is NOT a program to follow or any sort of guidebook for healty living other than as a lookup reference.  If you are looking for a program try SHAPE your life, from the editors of shape magazine 
 I've liked these books in the past, but this one fails to inform or entertain. It's not terribly awful, just not very good. The writers are average or below average, and for a "best" anthology, that's not good enough. I wouldn't pass this book on to anyone, and that tends to say it all 
 I got this book to cook a traditional Christmas dinner for my family and friends, and I was so disappointed. I would not recommend this book. The recipes were not great. The photographs can be very deceptive. The banana pudding was mere mush.The 'yassa' chicken was disappointing and not to mention demoralizing. As a black woman, I am trying to get away from the 'yess sah' notion. Go elsewhere for true Southern cooking. No wonder there are so many of her books in the 'used' section for under $6 
 I was disappointed in this work-out. I admit it is the first time I have ever done one of his DVD/tapes but I expected more, judging from previous reviews. The most glaring thing is that the class is so crowded and although the exercises are well thought out with the strengthen/stretch sequences, this program has a hurried, disjointed flow to it.I feel like I'm doing calisthenics using yoga positions! I can't help but compare him to Karen Voight, Rainbeau Mars, Kate Potter (a Canadian with a wonderful TV Show called "Namaste" )and the mesmerizing voice of Eric Schiffman on the original Ali MacGraw video. If I can sit and WATCH a yoga tape and enjoy the movement and sound, well then that's for me. Because then I want to imitate what I see. There is nothing I want to imitate on this tape. In fact it made me feel restless afterwards. It had no "grace".   
 I know there are many different Jewish beliefs and approaches. I am not Jewish. The author makes an honest & straitforward approach. A decent read 
 THIS BOOK IS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS. WANTED A BOOK THAT EXPLAINED HOW TO DO MANY PROJECTS. THIS SHOWS PICTURES OF COMPLETED PROJECTS BUT DOES NOT SHOW HOW .EXAPLE  A PICTURE OF A KALEIDOSCOPE BUT HAS NO EXPLAINATION OF HOW DO DO IT.IN ORDER TO PRINT OUT MANY PROJECTS YOU NEED TO PURCHASE OTHER SOFTWARE.WANTED TO DO A MONTAGE BUT FOUND OUT AFTER I ORDERED BOOK YOU NEED TO PURCHASE ARC SOFT. 
 That the left(self annointed purveyors of tolerance) writes, sells and buys books with titles such as this?  The people in the title of this book couldn't dream of being as "intolerant" and "hateful" as the writer and readers of garbage such as this.  How bout this.  I hate all of you who write and read books like this......gasp!  Did he just say hate 
 There was no "0 star" to rate this book. Someone wrote your innane comments were "South Park" but that was giving you more credit than due.  This book knocks rooms decorated with "mod," "hippy," "psychedelic," primary, analogous, complementary, or accented neutral colors; functional autonomous rooms combining sports, hobbies, recreation, and academic dimensions within one room; it knocks the budget-conscious decorations of the handmade, handpainted, functional, antique, dime store, yard sale, thrift or expensive furniture stores; it slams grouped wall, shelf decorations used as room accents: keys, Americana cushions, books, candle holders, fruit in a bowl, potted plants; criticizes large eye-catching "centers of interest" used with living room furniture, sun face wall painting, "Abe Lincoln with butterfly bowtie," large eye over purple tub; the accented neutral black/white/yellow bedroom with Colonial style poster bed, Queen Anne chair, rocking chair, possibly Ethan Allen, round table may be possibly an old wooden construction cable spool covered with home sewn tablecloth; cubist, geometric, fractal wall decorations; use of light through uncovered windows, sheer curtains, roll-up wooden blinds, tie-back sheer curtains; and repainting an antique chair to accent a child's room.  I would not purchase nor recommend this book nor anything else written by this author.    
 When this manga came out i was so very excited. It turned out to be a total waste of time and money. This mangs was made to please the 'fan boys.' deffinetly. It was a boring read, simply filled with pictures of Mai's chest. Though, i should have guessed from the cover. -___-   For those of us who truly love this anime, and really enjoy the story line, DO NOT BUY.    thank yo 
 While this book may have some merits, I pulled it from the middle school library because the language, while it may be realistic, is too gratuitously rough for middle school students 
 I am a huge Cary Grant fan. Or I guess I should say I was a huge fan of the onscreen persona that is suave and the epitome of class for me. This book will blow away the image you had of Cary in films, and not in the best-written way. Reading this, I felt like it was a 50/50 mix of hearsay and fact. Whichever half you choose to believe, good luck watching his movies with the same fantasy as before 
 Johnny Tremain is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life, hands down. No book has filled me with such a sense of dread as I opened it like Johnny Tremain has. The way this book is written is as follows; *30 Pages of Filler *One page of plot For the entire book. That's really it. This haphazardly thown together clump of ink and pulped wood is like a swirling vortex of bad writing and mediocrity. I would not wish this book on anybody. not even my worst foes. I promise you if Amazon had a way to input stars lower then one, that vote would be mine for this book. Teachers; Don't let this be used in class. Everybody else; Spare yourself the misery and torment you would otherwise bring upon yourself by so much as reading the first paragraph 
 This book "might" help you if you are already an established business.  But if you are just starting one, forget it.  Why?  Because you have no customers that can refer you to anybody!  It's also a summation of many of the business proverbs that we already know :   - be nice to your customers  - ask them how you can better serve them  - and don't forget to ask them for referrals  That's about it.  I'll give the book two stars because I always do for any book that at least introduces me to one new idea. And that new idea for this book is -- don't ever argue with your customer! Use their objections to how you are failing them as an opportunity to do better by them.  Put your ego in your pocket and LISTEN to them instead of making excuses for your lack of performance.  In that sense, you will have gotten the entire message of this book. 'Nuff said. 
 This book did absolutly nothing for me. Just a boring thing to write in, which I haven't 
 This book is better than nothing but there is a lot of room for improvement regarding quality.  It went a long way towards helping me pass the 70-536 exam.  This book has an alarming number of typos in it, tends to gloss over some important items, and is missing some key exam items.  I bought this because I didn't want to wait months and months for other resources to become available.  If you can wait I suggest you do 
 This book is a complete crock of sh*t. I feel like Strassman was a researcher with good intentions that ended up loosing it much like Leary or McKenna. There is no science here. If you don't mind that his proposals have no basis in scientific literature, and you like reading personal accounts of high dose DMT experiences, go ahead and read this. But don't expect to find out anything you didn't already know 
 I guess this book would be better appreciated by those who actually believe in magic, protection spells and things like that. The book does offer it's fair share of information to those who are just interested in monsters generally, but there are far more better books for that kind of research.  The book has chapters for ghosts, demons, angels, werewolves, vampires and other things that go bump in the night. Greer has included sightings and legends from the history, but I always found myself wanting more details. Most portions of the book are about monsters generally and they also offer magical means to defend oneself from monsters. If you are not interested in magic and spells, the book offers only a brief glance into the monster lore.  I was somewhat disappointed in the book, it had only a few interesting bits and pieces of information. Most of the times I found myself reading about Greer's own theories, which I am sorry to say, didn't seem too convincing. If you are offering an example from the history or news, you should include more information about it, otherwise the example has no real use.  If you are interested magic and it's involvement with monsters, this might be the book for you. If you want to really read about monsters, I recommend you find other books for your reading pleasure 
 Objective?  The reviewer that called this book 'objective and factual' wasn't reading the same book I read.  Factual perhaps, but objective...no way.  There are so many good points in this book, but they get lost amid the nasty digs and political slant.    The insinuation that the misery and insecurity that women's magazines shovel is part of some large liberal conspiracy is laughable.  The author is guilty of what she accuses her liberal media colleagues of doing.  The message is a mixed one; you are woman therefore you are strong and powerful yet blame the liberals for all the bad messages you've been fed over the years.  Where's the empowerment in pointing fingers and assigning blame?    The driving force behind what goes into magazines is whatever sells.  You could easily argue that no one forced women to buy those magazines and read those articles.  If there's anyone to blame, we should be pointing the finger back at ourselves.  Our empowerment lies in our ability to vote using the dollars we spend or, as the case may be, refuse to spend 
 This book is such a drag- not for the math bit, but the non-mathematical sections. The stories and ramblings are absolutely unnecessary, and detract from the substance. The problem is that the stories are inextricably intertwined with the math, and quite impossible to skip if you don't want to  miss the math bit. To the extent I was able to drag on, the calculus portions seemed great, but it became too tiresome going through the flab. The great book on calculus has to be "How to enjoy Calculus" by Eli S. Pine- a book I regret not having known in my school days 
 First of all there is no such word in Websters and I do agree with some of the other reviewers.  I did read Blindsighted and found much repeated word for word from that.  The people in charge of solving this do indeed have too too many personal problems and not enough swapping of information.  When the doc hears something, she doesn't know what they are talking about as no information was given her by the detectives.   After all she was at the scene of most the crimes and should have been given a better handle on it.    Then I hate the way the perps get away with stuff right under the noses of the surveilance.  This author sure leaves you dangling.   
 I bought this book in the hopes that the text would be simple enough for my four-year-old. It was simple enough, but at great cost.  Details I remember from the tellings I heard as a child were missing.   There was nothing in the text that would help a child even remotely empathize with the characters.  Ugh.  I wanted my son to like or at least remember the story, but hearing this retelling was like eating cardboard.  The illustrations weren't that great either, with nothing to attract a child's eye.  Get a different version 
 Take a look at the number of copies up for resale - seems this is not a book that is worth keeping - and I would agree with that (clearly widely held) view. This is 'pop' fiction at it's most cover-enticing best but that's all it is. You can do a lot better than this - even for entertainment. Listen to the nearest politician for an hour or so! You'll get about the same rate of rhetoric per ear 
 You talk about disappointed, this is the icing on the cake.  All I hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was.  Not even close.  Whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong.  I love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such. There are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the 70's, but this is not one of them....seriously, don't buy this.  I don't know why it is so highly regarded.  The acting, story, and especially the music is EL TERRIBLE'.  It's like porn quality acting, a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a Disney movie.  It could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy, through in some disturbing music, and made the bad guys, well, more bad.  It could be remade (which i'm usually against) 
 Look at my other reviews for other meat tenderizers that are made a lot better than this one and would be more worth your while.  I say it's flimsy because it's so skinny.  Other ones have a wider base and offers more stability when you're stabbing into cuts of meat.  This smaller one also means you have to stab the meat a lot more.  I say just get the larger one that's more stable and takes less effort 
 This book is mediocre at best for professionals who know nothing about the business--there are much better ones out there. While the information in this book seems accurate, it was very shabbily put together. Don't waste  your money on this one 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 I loved avp but i mean come on! they made the soundtrack really stink 
 Imagine a textbook without a glossary of terms. A book thatseems to use fancy nomenclature only as a tool to boostthe authors egos. Having strained through this text only by shear interest in Remote, I would advise any academic to look towards the piles of other more appropriatly constructed textbooks concerned with remote. As to the publishers claim that it also concerns itself with GIS applications, yes, but in an obscure and unfriendly manner. Do not consider this book as a textbook choice. It only serves to discredit the  noble and forthright advances of a vital technology 
 First of all, just to get things off of my chest (and believe you me, I usually LOVE getting everything off of my chest right off the bat!) Item! Jack Canfield is an excellent and gifted motivational writer. Golly, he has motivated me to write a review, right? However, this time around old Jack's soup could use a little salt or herbage to his advice. If you ask anyone where I work, I am always promoting Chicken Soup for the Soul stories however I didn't find these all that courageous or creative. I mean, what is creative or daring about a woman who builds an entire miniature of her office environment in her cubicle using Beanie Babies for each of her coworkers. And what bigger point was Jack trying to point out about the manager who tried to motivate his daily reports by having them act out scenes from "A Room With a View" before they started their shift each day? Kind of lost me this time, Mr Canfield 
 this book is extremly bad,,too mucho technich and encripted,,with stupid examples and long long lines,,saying nothing,, this book is so bad,,that I did not finish reading it,, is so boring,,if I could I would give 0 star to this book,,,I highly reccommend the book "the first time manager,,,"  that book is master and exceptional,,written in a very simple a open language,,this book is 100% excellent.. 
 I hate to be the fly in the ointment of the other reviews.  But as someone who is more concerned with protecting his networks than trying to figure out the math behind the security, I found this book's title and description on the back cover as well as in the preface to be *highly* misleading.  By reading the preface and the back of the book, you gain absolutely no indication that this book is mired in mathematical theory with very little practical application to the everyday, IT environment. The only possible audience for this book comprises computer science students and software engineers who are into encryption, cipher algorithms, and related theories.  There is absolutely no indication of that until you actually start getting into the chapters.  That is not to belittle Mr. Bishop, what he knows, or what he does. I have no doubt that as a professor at the University of California at Davis he is well respected and very knowledgeable of his field. I'm equally sure that in a scientific, trivia challenge, his knowledge and experience would beat me into the ground until I was just a thin, red film. I'm only saying that this book is not one that I can recommend to anyone who is looking for practical, security solutions, contrary to what the title might infer. It is far too mathematical in nature and creates complexities to the theories of computer security that frankly do not apply to the day-to-day systems and network administrator.  In the real world practical, IT solutions include identifying how potential intruders might gain entry to the network. Practical solutions also include how to identify weaknesses in the existing network infrastructure as well as weaknesses in the existing authentication mechanism, among others. Once these weaknesses are identified, IT people need practical solutions to eliminate those weaknesses. Even if the potential solutions are not practical at the current time, identifying what can happen until such time must happen for in order to plan the next stage of securing the environment.  These matters are certainly discussed but not in ways that most IT professional would consider to be valuable. Discussions on the Chinese Wall Model, lattices, and the Extended Euclidean algorithm are not going to be of any practical use whatsoever when you are looking to select and implement an authentication mechanism for a heterogeneous enterprise, nor are they going to be of value when you're looking a Sarbanes-Oxley auditor in the eye and he asks "So, please explain your network security implementations and how you plan on securing your login procedures."  Unfortunately, even those topics that have no direct relation to mathematics, such as availability and the implementation of an auditing system, are described through mathematical formulae. To most IT personnel, auditing involves intruder detection, log scanning, network monitoring, SNMP traps, and of course reporting tools to determine when there is suspicious activity. If I went to my manager and said that we have to anticipate pending connections based on the formula a + b is greater than cb, he'd tell me to contact the confidential, Employee Help line. I can only imagine what he'd tell me if I said that we have to tune our incoming-packet, time-out value in the Solaris kernel to be based on the Linux implementation of the Berstein and Shenk formula of h(s1,sa,sp,da,dp,s1) + n + ((2^24)*t) + [h(s2, sa,sp,da,dp,s2) mod 2^24].  Now, in fairness my review might be rather harsh, but I think it's more the frustration that this book's description is not accurate to its contents and expectations that it puts on the potential reader. Perhaps it is accurate when it comes to the actual content as suggested by the other glowing reviews, but it most certainly is not when it comes to the expected audience or what their expectation might be. In this case I'm sure that this is the right book, but the way that the preface and and back cover are written clearly are not indicative of the intended audience.  Metaphorically speaking, I was expecting to find directions so that I could drive to the nearest grocery store. Instead, I ended up reading about the physics of depressing the accelerator pedal with just the right amount of pressure in combination with the thermodynamics of the detonation of a combustible, fuel substance with a mixture of oxygen and the appropriate temperature and aperture of the ignition mechanism to create the most efficient energy source within a controlled environment. Additionally, I received information about the methodologies of harnessing that thermodynamic energy and converting it through the appropriate gear and torque mechanisms to a forward thrust thus making it possible to move the vehicle in the direction intended while simultaneously balancing out the appropriate fluid injection and combustion level. Also taken into consideration was the manipulation of the speed impedance lever so as to reduce or cease in its entirety the inertial momentum, regardless of direction, of the vehicle when necessary. Let us not forget the guidance controlling mechanism thus altering the directional inertia of the vehicle so as to project it to the destination position to which I expect the vehicle to travel.  Even with all of that, I still don't know where the nearest grocery store is 
 Ordered October 9th.... Not delivered as of November 22nd. Now due to arrive mid December. Yuck 
 I'm Black and for my hair type, 4b, I try to use natural products on my hair and it didn't have those "no-no chemicals and oils" that are known to be damaging to black hair.    Well this product did not, as it advertised, which was to "stay put."  I tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb-coils or finger-coil in place.    I did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good.  Sad thing is that I can't get my money back. I use it as a hair grease for my scalp. I hope I've been helpful 
 Williams Fosters analyzes Latino gay and lesbian movies.  He has an expansive view of the genre; he covers U.S. Latinos/as and Latin Americans.  Unfortunately, the average American viewer won't have access to all the films that he discusses.  His chapters are boring and confusing.  There was not a single chapter that I found enlightening, even though some of the movies discussed are excellent in their own right.  I am surprised that such a guru of Latino gay and Latina lesbian issues could write such a poor book.  Maybe this is an example of publish or perish.  There are so many other books and book chapters about films and their representations of gay men and lesbians of color that are better.  I highly do NOT recommend this book 
 A MOUSE LOOSES HIS FAMILY MEMBERS & THEN FINDS THEM.  IT'S JUST AN OK BOOK, VERY UNDERSERVING OF ALL THE 5-STAR REVIEWS.  A BETTER MOUSE BOOK WOULD BE- IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.   Re: J Czecholinski  Hey J, you couldn't be more wrong! Your review is as flawed as Lahaye and Jenkin's unbiblical writing. First, I am a Christian who does believe that Jesus is coming back, but I do not believe He is coming back in a secret, silent rapture that the LEFT BEHIND series is making millions of Christians believe. I believe in the verse you used (to try and prove me wrong), which is 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves.Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.' When Jesus comes back, we will know it. Keys words being COMMANDING SHOUT and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD. We're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years. In the Bible, 7 years refers to completeness or totality, which is time until Jesus comes back for good. Lahaye and Jenkins are taking figurative language from John's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies. This adding to Scripture and polluting the word of God makes me think of Galatians 1:6-9 which says: "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!" This is what Lahaye and Jenkins are doing: perverting the gospel with their own spin. And your "belief" in the anti-Christ is incorrect as well (along with Lahaye and Jenkins). Check out these verses: 1st John 2:22 "Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son." or 1st John 4:3 "...but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world." Key words their being EVEN NOW IS ALREADY IN THE WORLD. This is referring to SATAN who was in the world in John's day and still in the world. The Bible says in 1st John 2:18 that many anti-Christs have come and anti-Christ is anyone who is against Christ. There are many people who are persecuting the Church and Christians (as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd Timothy 3). Why are we looking for somebody like Nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the Anti-Christ? Why are polluting the word of God to try and sell books and movies. Why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking? Do you think that the disciples, when Jesus ascended to heaven, thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation? No! Finally, you said that 2nd Corinthians 6:2 says: "TODAY is the day of salvation I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation." What bible version are you looking at. 2nd Corinthians 6:2 clearly states: "For he says, 'In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation." Nothing about Tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures!!! You are just making up Scripture, perverting the GOSPEL! Now verse 4 talks about troubles (lower-case "t"), hardships, distresses, etc. That is happening now, today until Jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of God to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period!!! Live today like it was your last day, because you could die or Jesus could come back (and believe me, you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent, secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years, I will continue to follow the God-breathed word of God and not fluff of Lahaye and Jenkins. "Tribulation" is found once in the bible (Rev 7:14 NIV) and it is with a lower-case "t" and has nothing to do about what the books suggest. "Rapture" never appears as this is a word that hasn't been around that long. So in summary, Jesus is coming back and we will know about it (whether you are a Christian or not). And off the subject, yes, baptism is essential to becoming a Christian and being saved (not praying Jesus into your heart)...it seems that the same people who believe in Lahaye's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well. Please do yourself a favor. Read the Bible and follow it. If you do that, then you won't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like J. Czecholinski who cannot even get his Scriptures straight!  Follow the teachings of God 
 Having read the previous book by this duo about biblical archeology I looked forward to a good and interesting read.  I was hugely disappointed.  There was nothing new in this book: it seemed to be a re-hash of some of the material in the earlier book.  It may well be interesting to those who have not read the first book, but for me it was very tempting to put it down.  (However, I did read it through to the end. 
 This was my first Coutlter novel, so maybe this book isn't indicative of her other books, but this one was very poorly written and a real disappointment.   Her characters have no authenticity and are poorly developed. For example, the main character at one point is almost hysterical at seeing a skeleton, but soon after is boldly engaged in a gunfight with a madman. These kinds of glaring character problems pop up through the entire book.   At times the writing is very stilted, with short, simple sentences strung one after the other. It reads like a draft rather than a finished novel. The dialog is also poorly written, and sometimes I found myself having to read it twice to figure out what was being said.   The romance aspect is very poorly developed. We get no sense of a developing relationship, it seems as though the two characters barely know one another, and yet they get engaged at the end of the book.  Coulter throws in a subplot that is clunky and doens't integrate into the main story at all. Because of this subplot, the book ends up with not one, but two deranged psychos who try to kill the heroine (two psychos for the price of one!), and it seems just silly and unnecessary.  I'm glad I merely checked this stinker out from my local library and didn't spend money on i 
 This book has beautiful illustrations and an inclusive message, however I have one problem with it.  It says, "I've got one daddy.  I've got two."  On the accompanying picture, it shows two pairs of men with a child each.  In one pair, one man has a child in a baby sling, while the other man strolls along with him.  This content was disturbing to me, and I, subsequently, will not read this book to my children.  (There are other heterosexual couples in the picture mentioned above) 
 This book is well written -- it is easy to read and in many senses incredibly engaging. The book is well organized, argued, and paced to fit the interested college reader.  It in unfortunate, then, that the entire premise of the book is misleading, and that the arguments are appallingly and unblinkingly one-sided. The title, American Democracy in Peril, should immediately hint at a major problem: Though working on many principles of democracy, America is not and has never been a true and direct democracy, nor was it ever meant to be. Hudson ignores this simple fact available in any grade school Social Studies textbook to make his point.  Hudson's points are, as well, virtually entirely one sided. All but a few of his arguments are completely liberal, and some, especially the section on Radical Individualism, are communist. Such a position would be all fine and good if Hudson ever acknowledged that the other side might have a few good arguments. Instead, Hudson mercilessly attacks conservative and (especially) libertarian viewpoints, in many cases arguing for the case of argument, even when the other case does have merit.  Such a book would be fine for personal reading -- the Republicans and Libertarians have sold millions of copies of similar books -- but being as it is a textbook, such flaws are inexcusable. To present undergraduate students with a work that is written using specific knowledge and layers of defensive argumentation, especially when presented as background material or well-grounded scholarly opinions is dangerously pushing open minds into a corner where they are not permitted to be open, but rather constrained to one viewpoint that does not even begin to acknowledge any others.  In sum, William Hudson's American Democracy in Peril is, though well written, a non-scholarly, one-sided, often hostile work that should be viewed as one-side of the argument, and not the entire argument itself 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 This book is being defined as an introduction to Transportation and Logistics. Had I known the extremely simplistic tone and amount of information given here I would have not order this book. The book has only 184 pages. The last 84 were wasted with petty information. The appendices from page 131 to 184 have common information one can learn at work. The Chapter 4, page 101 to page 124, the book's space has been wasted with the pictures and history of the personal computer, from vacuum tubes and Altair 8800, on. Chapter 5, page 125-130 talks about the significance of the Web! These two chapters would have been great information in 1990! Who should buy the book? The rightful readership for this book: GED - forklift operator -who has the laudable drive to learn a few extra things his supervisor is hiding from him for fear of inside competition! Here is why, in the words of the author, in explaining how to input value in the four variables of the logistic function, the author says: "All right, this may be more math than some of you really want to contend with. I know it requires some mental gymnastics but the concept is important"! This book should be in the price range of $5.00 with a chosen delivery time of three-four weeks, so that the cost of ownership would not be over $8.00. Many authors violate the trust of readership by not specifying the level of readership to which the book is addressed. Mr. Stroh did just that 
 I found this book impossible to use! The photos and illustrations were so detailed, with lines traveling everywhere, that I couldn't transfer what I saw on the page to what I saw on my hand. I was disappointed 
 Simply put, Jay-Z is incredibly overrated.  I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked him.  His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again.  He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars.  Nothing special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since everyone else is on his d!ck.  I think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.    Granted, Jay-Z does use some good metaphors, but for the most part his lyrics are shallow.   Best tracks on this album:  Can't Knock the Hustle Brooklyn's Finest w/Biggie Dead President 
 Within the first 12 min of this audio book this "author" blames all the flaws of our (American) society on "liberals" and the "intellectual elites".  Rather odd considering the fact that she: 1. graduated from Yale, Summa Cum Laude.  2. did her graduate studies at Cambridge University.  3. received her J.D. from Stanford University Law School. 4. actually won an Outstanding Intellectual Achievement award.   Oh yeah, she is also a frequent guest on Fox News. Need I say more?   This is a kinder, sweeter, gentler Ann Coulter - but far less entertaining.    Needless to say, don't take this book seriously. 
 I bought it from another store, turned it on to toast it did nothing. Changed setting to bake and soon after it started to smoke. I smell a recall 
 It is bloated.  If there is any good information, its hidden very deep and i'm not patient enough to look for it.  I want my money back 
 I found this book--which I finally threw down unfinished in irritation after the umpteenth faux "fact" was presented--trite beyond belief. I presume that a history is factual. This was not. The authors presented so much factually wrong, unsupported information and claims that I finally decided I could not justify spending more time reading it. For instance, they claim that both Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette drank champagne with a last meal before their executions. Well, Louis did enjoy a fairly good meal--without champagne--before his execution. Marie Antoinette, however, was so brutally treated and degraded by her captors as the Widow Capet before hers that there most assuredly was no "last meal" for her, much less a champagne chaser. Her maid recounted the details of her prevailing upon her to eat a few mouthfuls of some vermicelli which she warmed up on her stove in her cell. If she drank anything it was water--likely from the nearby and very polluted Seine. Anyone offering her champagne would have most certainly ended up being arrested for royalist sympathies. With all the many fine sources out there on both of these executionsw, how can the Kladstrups get away with printing such trite, factually wrong drivel merely to add some silly patina of faux glamour to their thesis? Then they go on to describe the aristocrats being guillotined, describing how the victims were forced to kneel and put their heads on the block. Have the Kladstrups even the remotest familiarity with how a guillotine works?? There is no block. There is no kneeling. There is no cooperation by the victim whatsoever. Read any source on the topic. Yet again, the Kladstrups trot out rubbish which is not even factually close to correct. Their description of the executions of Desmoulins and Danton--whom they falsely claim were drunk and singing a drinking song as they awaited their executions--round out this litany of utterly fabricated nonsense by which they attempt to link champagne to just about every event in French history. So. With so much drivel and made up "fact", how can one trust, much less enjoy, any of their other assertions in this so-called history? Definitely a candidate for recycling--or the outhouse 
 Awkward is a well-respected scholar employed at an Ivy League university, so he doesn't have to please everyone.  I feel quite conflicted about this book.  This is a collection of essays in which Awkward discusses scholars looking beyond their own identity groups.  For example, he writes about black men and feminism and white scholars examining black texts.  So he's proven himself a strong anti-essentialist.  Also, his work on feminism situates him as a role model for non-sexist men, particularly non-sexist brothas.  Still, he writes in a rambling and confusing style, even more so than most academics.  I liked Part Two of this book, where he discusses specific cultural products, much more than Part One.  This book included some really interesting cultural studies.  Still, it felt uneven and it is hard for me to embrace it in its entirety 
 The book has nice photographs and examples of stamping, but doesn't have enough information about the techniques nor the supplies used. I didn't like it. I thought I would learned everything for stamping but this is not the right book. I think I would keep searching in other books 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 	I read this book on the recommendation of two close friends - both of whom are retired English teachers - and both of whom should have known better.  It is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Although other reviewers have commented on some of the same things, I think the book is so bad they bear repeating. 	The characters are so thinly drawn as to be stick figures.  The ambitious young professional woman, the used-up poet turned to drink, the insecure young wife, and the brother who main functions seem to be the guy who brings the boat and to be the near recipient of a "quickie on the rocks."  Who could possibly care about any of them?  Without anyone to care about, the author has no chance of developing suspense and eliciting an emotional response from her readers.  	Switching back and forth between two stories in alternating chapters can work as a plot device, but its success depends upon the two stories being brought together in some convincing fashion at the end.  This doesn't happen, and as if that's not enough, the present day chapters are further split by references to the 1873 murder scattered throughout them.  Clumsy and distracting are the best things one can say about the plot development. 	Even though this is a novel, its characters should behave within the scope of believable human actions.  Asking your husband when he first met the woman you suspect he may be having an affair with is believable; asking him the question when you're in the midst of trying to save yourself and family members in a violent storm at sea is not.  There are other examples of forced dialogue, but this is among the most outrageous. 	Lastly, subtlety is obviously not Ms. Shreve's long suit.  The androgynously named child, Billie, is the only one to suffer the consequences of everyone else's failings.  Gee, is this really the death of innocence?  It's about as nuanced as the murderer's ax on Smuttynose.  And how about the danger of  humorless puritans in the face of  real or supposed sexual variations?  Who would have thought it?   	So why has the book been as popular as it is?  It appeals to the world view of certain young moderns:  Sex is the driving force behind all human actions, the brooding woman is the most fascinating creature in view, and a civility devoid of human feeling is to be prized.     	The Norwegian characters in the historical murder prompt one last reaction.   In downtown Oslo is the Vigelund Sculpture Park.  It is populated with the large and brooding sculptures of Gustav Vigelund, a local sculptor whose work is appreciated almost nowhere else on earth.  If one spends anytime there, one comes away gloomy, perplexed, and with the certain knowledge that an afternoon has been wasted.  Save yourself the expense of a trip to Norway - read The Weight of Water instead 
 This book is very slow moving. You must be truely concerned with the matter he is talking about to actually understand or even want to read it 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 Falling in Love is one of my favorite scents ever.  It's basically my go-to fragrance for everyday.  If you're a fan of this scent you already know it's really pretty but very light.  That's why I was exited about the solid for touch-ups on the go.  Let me tell you, subtle is an understatement for this product. When I opened the seal and held it under my nose I could hardly smell it.  When I applied it (generously) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable.  I rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn't help at all.  I expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice.  Very disappointing.  
 I love dance music, techno music, remixed music, and Christmas music, but I cannot love this album.  Everytime I find a "remixed christmas" cd, I usually get it, just because I'm hoping someday there will be one that actually transforms traditional holiday songs into club anthems.  Unforntuanately, all of them have the same trend.  They sound like 4th graders having fun with a computer.  This one, as foul as it is, is actually better than most, however.  There Are a few songs that aren't bad, Hark The Harold Angels Sing isn't exactly regrooved, but it's nicely mixed. White Christmas has good usage of vocals and beats. The rest however . . . well, Carol of the Bells, for instance, sounds like someone banging pots and pans to the music of a very, VERY slow paced funeral march.  It is so bad.  There are Dj scribble sounds, a demoic voice that whispers "Christmas", whoosey moans like a smurf taking a crap. It's horrid.  If you don't believe me, listen to the samples, they won't lie to you 
 I expected something different in terms of his music. At the same time I received the product promptly and in great condition 
 Like my topic says, be sure you know what you buy. Robinson is giving details on how the book was found, compiled, traded, stolen and so fourth around the world. He goes into why it has been covered up for so long, instead of actually getting into what is written in the Gospel of Judas. If you want to know the History of this Gospel, and why it took so long to surface into the public eye, then I highly recommend this book. However, if your looking into the Gospel of Judas itself, what it says, and it's meanings, I would advise a different book 
 The book did not present anything new or in a diffrent way. I was very disappointed in the book. I have seen much better books 
 Instead of talking about what you can do to help your husband make more money, why not let him help you make more money and he can stay home with the kids?  Help him triple his income and then run off with a leggy-blonde leaving you jobless and responsible for those kids.  That's a great idea 
 John Barry's compositions are pleasantly sweeping. There's nothing wrong with this album, just not really enough to recommend it.  I was puzzled to learn that some time between my buying the LP record and the issuing of this CD, the track "The Music of Goodbye (love theme from Out of Africa)" was omitted. It's not that this song, sung by Melissa Manchester, is a must-have; it's more that it's sneaky to leave off tracks when you reissue a soundtrack in another format 
 This is an addendum to my review of two years ago.    First off, I mentioned that the book is written on a grade-school level.  Why not produce another edition, with the title "The Depression Workbook for Smart People" or "The Depression Workbook for the College-Educated"?  This may help some of us to feel less put off and alienated.  Additionally, the book is also written from a highly feminine point of view.  The profession expresses concern that more men are not coming forward and seeking help for depression, but I believe many men are not comfortable with many of the suggestions put forward in this book (and many others).  Men are not inclined to take up painting, or knitting, or flower arranging.  We like skeet shooting, NASCAR, and cage fighting. In other words, expecting men to become more like women in order to get well is unreaslistic.  Another suggested edition: "The Depression Workbook for Men." 
 Early on the authors of this book let us know their extreme disdain for Christianity.  This didn't bother me at first, though I am a believer in Yahushua/Jesus.  It is always good to get more than one perspective.  But the constant sarcastic put downs of Christianity, and the presentation of themselves as understanders of the Gospel and it's impetus in history, got to be annoying really fast.  Baigent & Leigh think they are knowledgeable, they present themselves as objective scholars, but they are actually very biased.    It appears to me that their operating principal goes something like this:  "The supernatural stories of Jesus Christ are totally mythological [this belief they cannot resist emphasizing over and over, tiresomely] i.e., lies.  We know this because we assume a priori that the supernatural as it is presented in Scriptures does not exist and because we are beings who have vastly superior intellect to that of Christians. Therefore...we don't have to be too careful about our understanding of the Gospels, and can with impunity present ourselves as if we are experts on it, even though we are not at all - because you see, it's all nonsense and doesn't matter anyway!"  This type of intellectual dishonesty and sloppy thinking - like for example claiming that Paul was the first one to start worshipping Yahushua (hello, how about the first chapter of John, and the Apostle Thomas bowing before His feet and saying, "My Lord/Adonai and my Elohim/God" - duh) made me realize I couldn't take seriously any "scholarship" these two have to offer.  When it comes to the Dead Sea Scrolls there is so much controversy.  Why should I trust these sloppy, dishonest thinkers, to tell me the real truth?  Answer:  I didn't and I don't.  There is some purely objective fact to be found in the book - most of it known very well already.  If you haven't heard those parts already, you can find them on the internet and save the money 
 Oedipus was a weird book to reab, because the plot was all twisted. The characters in the book are nasty. Oedipus kills his father and has two kids with his mother.... 
 I usually enjoy Ms. Maron's Deborah Knott books very much. The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life. This one, however, is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional. The first murder doesn't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just "there". The second one involving Dwight's son (who is a very poorly developed child character) and his ex wife is not very interesting.   I devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this. Probably not, though-I foresee several storylines involving husband/stepmother/stepchild conflicts. Glad I checked it out from the library and didn't purchase it outright..do the same and don't waste your money 
 Did not purchase.....there was no look inside to see if it was what I was looking fo 
 (Hey, this review is supposed to be 5 stars! What's up with the editing?)   O. K.   Get ready.   Take a ...deeeeeeep ....breath.....   This book, written in 1991, is about to become relevant again!  Yergin's "hydrocarbon man" is alive and well and living in the 21st century.  No book has ever captured the excitement, risk, and reward of the oil business like this volume does. Daniel Yergin documents oil patch history, from the simple beginnings as a native american medicine to todays complex international traffiking.  Truely, hydrocarbon extraction from the subsurface is the stuff of modern life.  Try to live without the carbon-hydrogen bond and you'll find out what life is like with an odd-even social-security-number lottery for the gas chamber. (Maybe I exaggerate a bit, but trust me... you don't want to look down this road.)  My advice:  Buy this book!   Buy it today!   Read it as soon as you receive it!   The next day may be too late!    (As I write this, gasoline prices rose today by about 8 cents because of the Alaskan pipeline.)     Also, thank your local geologist. And buy him a beer 
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 I wouldn't recommend this book 
 I bought this lens in May for my brand new Rebel XT. I used it on a vacation mainly, and am pretty dissapointed. I'm no pro, or even skilled amateur, but I do know the lens is not giving me quality shots.  The autofocusing is slow, and af or manual shots aren't very sharp at any zoom. There seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me.  I wanted a good, all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types. I guess this would fit the bill, if it took sharp pictures. I wouldn't pay more than $150 for this lens again 
 This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started.  The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all.  I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help.  It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.  So, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so 
 I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.  I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.  To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.  I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.  For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.  Not a quality reader.  Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.  Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. "Eject" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.  Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick.  Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader 
 OK- to answer my own question, the ONLY reason this was published was as a personal favor or as serious ***-kissing. As far as chick lit goes (they are clearly going for that audience by the cover of this book), publishers need to realize that we won't read and like just anything. I laughed out loud hafter finishing the book where someone commented about "loving the sex scenes". Yes- maybe if I was 13 and had never read one before. But they are so sparse and pathetic, they are hardly worth mentioning. The entire basis of the book is on a reality TV show, which most chick lit readers are probably familiar with. The whole show made no sense (contestants don't live together? Cameras leave the lovebirds ALONE after they film dinner? People go on a yacht and aren't filmed most of the time? HELLO!), making the plotline flimsy at best. Character development is weak, and I really didn't care what happened to anyone. Totally predicatble- not one surprise throughout. The only reason I finished the book was that I belived it had to get better at some point- no such luck. Don't buy this book- get it from the library if you have to see for yourself how bad it truly is. It's certainly in no danger of having a waiting list.. 
  . . . and more nonsense.  Like I've stated in previous reviews, the only reason I read any of this c**p is because as a professional Christian educator and theologian, questions about stuff like this come up far more often than I would like -- and I've gotta have my ammo ready.  Here we go again:  Dispensational pre-millinalism, which is the theology presented in the book as "authentic" Christianity, was invented out of whole cloth in the mid 19th century.  This is not the faith of the Apostles.  This is not the faith of the Early Church (East or West).  This is not the faith of the Reformers.  Luther and Calvin would have rejected this.  This is not the faith of the Great Awakening.  Wesley and Whitfield would have rejected this.  Even in Protestantism, this represents a minority "out there" viewpoint.  A non-Christian who picks up one of these books and believes that it represents mainstream Christianity will be grossly deceived.  This is not honest theology; this is not honest biblical interpretation; and the writing is horrible to boot 
 Buy "How to draw comics the Marvel Way" instead, as Stan Lee and John Buscema cover all the necessary points in a few pages, as opposed to wasting your money on a book like this. Although kudos to this guy for padding a book this size. He must be close with Scott McCloud 
 This tricycle is simply way too big.  While the seat position is adjustable, even when adjusted, this thing is simply huge!  I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster.  By then, he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike, so I just don't get the point of this.  Why in the world would someone build a trike so big?  I did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires, and was fairly sturdy (at least in terms of construction).  I suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike, maybe this monster would be OK. I did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though: First, the grips are fairly fragile plastic and I imagine will break after just a tumble or two.  Second, the way the seat "adjustment" works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar.  This would be OK, but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar, so I had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place.      Overall, I'm just not very impressed.     
 I am trying to find the warranty info on this product.  Since this product is not inexpensive it should last longer than the maybe 5 times I used it.  Even though I was careful with it the silicone is now split has exposed the metal wisk beneath. This cannot be sanitary as food can get in the crevices there & cause contamination 
 This book was a disappointment, especially since it's coming from Princeton Review.  I took someone else's advice and studied from the Kaplan GRE Psych Review.  Kaplan is MUCH better.  After making my own personal condensed study guide of all the terms reviewed in Kaplan, I then went to the Princeton Review book.  Princeton Review had way less than Kaplan, and they also missed out on really important topics.  For example, the cognitive psych chapter is only 4 pages long and includes problem-solving (i.e. definitions for schema, scripts, etc.), information-processing (i.e. semantic model), and emotion.  Meanwhile, the Kaplan book goes into all the types of memory, people associated with terms, intelligence, language-- a better representative of my cognitive psych class.   I'm glad I didn't waste too much time on Princeton Review 
 A good book with one major hypocritical flaw. I know from my own experience and the author says herself in the book that creative people are "open-minded, non-critical." Yet her book is directed toward women. There are sections on women writers and all of the characters illustrated in the book are female. For example, there is an exercise to "Become Your Own Superhero." The cut-out for this exercise is a female figure and there is only women's clothes and hair to put on the figure. It is disappointing that the author, in an uncreative, close-minded way, geared her book to women. As a man who works in a creative field and is trying to live more creatively overall, I liked the book and find it useful. Yet I couldn't help but feel marginalized and disappointed by the exclusivity and short-sightedness of the author (when I feel like this, my creativity gets stifled). It's is sad that the author apparently feels women need more help than men in "living out loud." In my experience I have found the opposite to be true 
 I was not really impressed with this CD.  The previous 2 CDs(Mission to Please, Eternal) were so much better.  R Kelly is a great producer, but did not write the best songs for the Isleys for this.  2 Bad !!! :(  Isleys were better off with Jam and Lewis from the Eternal CD.  Listen and Buy at your own risk 
 This book is composed of two stories.  The first, called Folded Hands is nothing short of brilliant.  Jack Williamson created a rather bizarre, almost tongue and cheek idea, that works well in this quick blast that had me laughing and feeling chilled all at the same time.  Williamson didn't take himself too seriously but the short story had some terrific ideas.  Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the novella.  The second story, for me anyway, felt weighed down by far too much dramatic dialog and unrelenting techno babble that dragged the story down.  The Humanoids idea -- that mankind must be protected from itself ,can't help but sound a bit silly in execution and in the second story, Williamson goes for the straight dramatic and it feels awkward.  Granted there are some brilliant ideas but they don't play out because the author is too busy trying to explain this bizarre science that can defeat the humanoids.  That in itself sounds like a parady but he plays it straight! When Asimov wrote robot stories he understood when not to take himself too seriously.  On top of that, I found it a bit hard not to feel sorry for the Humanoids.  They really are passionate and just completely naive about what they are doing and its consequences.  I wish logic instead of mass destruction would have been formulated to deal with the issue.  Oh well 
 I read parts of this book for a graduate course side by side with David Cannadine's "Ornamentalism." There's no comparison--Cannadine's book is superb and deeply engaged with the history. Wilson's is MUCH more sensationalist and much less historical 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 "My Reflections" dvd is much better as it is a concert. This dvd is a bunch of videos and interviews. Not a keeper. Rent in first. 
 This book contained much of the same information as some of the other books, however it was not as easy to read.  I enjoy the books that are more colorful, have graphs and pictures, as well as testimonials.  This book lacked in those areas 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 Yes, I ordered this directly off this amazon page, and yes, I can report that it has seven fins (counting the outermost ones that hold the control panel, etc) and not nine. I read all the reviews just as you probably are doing right now, and thought to give it a shot since the preponderance of opinion seemed to think that there were nine fins and it worked great, as opposed to seven fins and working badly. But the radiator appeared at my doorstep with the lesser number of fins, however which way I tried to count the greater.  So. In summary, seven.  In other news, the heat all seemed to radiate from the top of the radiator; I could hardly feel any heat when I put my hands on the sides. Of course, I ran it on the lower setting, so it might have just been a function of the power output that I couldn't feel the heat radiating from the sides. (But I doubt it)  I ended up returning it, for which I received a full refund! Go Amazon! But someone should really update that picture they have up top to one that us obsessive fin-counters can get a more accurate reading from 
 I purchased Eldredge's "Wild at Heart", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given "Waking the Dead" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.   John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like "The Matrix" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.   The author also presents the image of God as "my friend". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.   This is exactly the same theology as building the largest "Christian" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to "offend anyone". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.   Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of "setting hearts free". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not "free" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, "Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.   For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend "The Way of the Master" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.  
 I thought this book was terrible.  I don't understand why people think this author is so amazing (unless they have really low IQ's).  Yes the subject matter was interesting but the delivery was very poor.  I showed it to a friend of mine and she said, "She writes like she learned to write from watching TV."  The novel is all dialogue and very little description, which doesn't equal up to an interesting read for me.  There was little suspense, I was not sympathetic to the main character, and the attempt at romance was a joke.  You want some real suspense in a mystery revolving around the legal system?  Go read Grisham 
 Somehow we ended up with this book.  The message is not nice.  It's all about who wins and who loses.  I do not recommend this book 
 Harsh words, yes!  "Into the Garden......." was disappointing and quite a bit "out there". Way too new age. If you want a free copy just send me a SASE 
 Do not waste money. Small laminated map, expensive, need a magnified glass to read it. You won't find any street there. Better pick-up a free map at in the metro area 
 The fact that a book has reached its fourth edition usually means it has some merit that readers have found useful. If that's the case with this book, it's a mystery to me how the book ever got out of the first edition.  First of all, the title "Single-Camera Video Production" led me to believe that the book's focus is on how to do everything for a video production using a single camera. For the bulk of the book, that's not what it's about. It's really a general book about using a video camera. (One section even illustrates using 5 cameras--rehearsing and preparing talent!)  Second, the illustrations are terrible. They look like they were done by a non-designer using Etch-a-sketch. Further, the drawings of the complex video cameras were so generic and seemingly dated that they were totally useless. However, that didn't matter because I didn't buy the book to learn about video cameras (that keep changing regularly), but rather some wisdom on the production process where the videographer is trying to produce using a single camera.  The reason that this book is rated two-stars instead of 1 (or 0) is because there were some materials on lighting with a single camera that were useful. (However, there was nothing unique and that I couldn't find on the Web for free.)  All in all, this book is a poorly crafted one, and one that I could cobble together with a topic search on the Web. Unfortunately, I think that a good book on Single-Camera Video Production is something that would be very useful. This just isn't it 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 I listened to a pair of these at a local Best Buy the other day just out of morbid curiousity.    Yep, the cheapness comes through loud and muddy: shrill piercing highs, weak fuzzy midrange vocals, and flabby bass that sounds like somebody's banging on a bucket.    You would be much better off spending the same or a little more money on a quality pair of BOOKSHELF speakers like the Athena AS-B2s, Infinity Primus 160s.  Better yet, combine the one hundred twenty five dollar Dayton sub from partsexpress dot com with a one hundred dollar pair of Polk R15s or the Internet-direct Fluance SV-6 from fluance dot com.    People, the only thing that Sony still makes well nowadays are its tube TVs, other than that it just lives off its big name 
 Somebody needs to do something. As some other people I hoped this cd was from the great Yes-man. But OH!! Desilusion, some dollars to the trash can. Please remove this item and help Jon fans to look for they really want 
 Any book based on the premise that the Rosenbergs were innocent, deserving of beatification, victims of awful America, is not going to date well.  1977, I suppose, was a kind of high-water mark for that sort of thinking.  If you have a friend who thinks Stalin was unfairly maligned, this may be the book for him.  I was forced to read this book cover to cover by a vindictive college professor who assigned it to me (and me alone) as the subject for a class writing project.  I loathed every minute of it.    From its doctrinaire anti-anti-communist, anti-Americanism; its sub-Dos Passos modernism; its sophomoric delight in scatology (giggle, giggle, tee hee, Nixon has sex with Ethel Rosenberg and is then anally raped by Uncle Sam).  There are no fully-formed characters, just endless making of puerile political points.  Nixon-bad.  Time Magazine-bad.  America-bad.  Ethel Rosenberg-saint and martyr.    Its like a bad book treatment of a very bad Ken Russell movie.  I'd rather eat jagged metal bits than be forced to read this pompous, train-wreck of a book ever again 
 It takes a peculiar kind of fortitude to plow through this overworked tale of the tortuous search for an object that is no more than a curiosity. Long before I reached the middle of the book, I was asking myself, "Why are you reading this thing?" I suppose the answer is that I wanted to see the search carried to a successful conclusion. I began skipping the sections of meaningless esoterica (written, I feel sure, to bring the book to its desired 360 pages exactly) and labored on to an ending that one reviewer here called "no payoff." To give one example of the tedious sort of preciosity that gave birth to this novel, I can tell you that sections within chapters are divided by a small geared wheel whose four spokes begin in chapter one as just a few degrees off from upright, gradually rotate clockwise until they're upright, then past upright, until one by one they return to the upright--in the final chapter. I'm sure the author loved this little conceit, possibly noticed by ten readers besides myself 
 I feel like I must have missed the boat based on other reviews. I thought the plot was cheesy and a lot of the action plain ridiculous,simplistic and unrealistic. The scenes where Dr. Brockton is abducted and he doesn't report it or treat it like a crime along with scenes with the Cooke county sheriff are so unrealistic I was quite surprised. This sort of lawless Eastern Tennessee genre did not work for me. This book seemed very cliche and unoriginal. Very dissappointing 
 I thought the book had very little value.  The author spent way too much time explaining why building your own home is a bad idea.  Many things can go wrong.  Most of us know that.  How about some encouragement and problem solving ideas.  Alas nothing of help.  The basic theme is to hire every expert known in the trade (including tree doctor), do nothing yourself, bring lots of money (double all your estimates, then then double the total), or better yet just save yourself the time and frustration and buy an existing home.  
 Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.  I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.  This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.  Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.  The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.  The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.  Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them 
 What a beautiful, godly message of self-respect for young women.  The analogy of two identical apples entrusted to two sisters to be kept for the rightful owner should have encouraged girls to resist sex before marriage and guard themselves for the wonderful man that God has for them. Instead it smacks of nighttime drama - sort of like an episode of "Dynasty."    One apple was overexposed, handled and caused to rot due to a careless bite taken by a man for whom the apple was not intended and did not belong.  The other apple was wisely hidden and protected so it stayed fresh and lovely.  With a stunning lack of sensitivity, the sister who is blonde, beautiful, fun-loving, and cheerful, must also be the self-centered, vain fool who lacks good judgement and integrity.  It follows that her apple rots.  As totally expected, the plain sister must have dark hair, be serious by nature and favored by her parents. She has the misfortune of being overlooked and undervalued.  But, stereotypically, her shining character makes up for her lack of beauty and vivaciousness.  Although she lacks charm and confidence, her care of the apple wins her the marriage proposal of the handsome, manly and discerning prince.    She is chosen - not for being attractive in her own right, but for her sterling character.  The blonde, pretty, but unworthy sister flees the scene in tears.  Although full of remorse for her mistakes, she is out of luck.  She is only mentioned again for having the ability to overcome her jealousy of her sister's good fortune.  Why is it necessary to equate beauty with badness and uglyness with goodness?  Why did they have to be sisters?  The contrast only makes God look unjust to both and unforgiving of the "loser."  Why will my daugters never read this book?  You guessed it.  Their looks and personality mirror the sisters in this fairytale.  Does that make one foolish and other wise?  Of course not.  I am tired of the same old yarn about the pretty blonde only being valued for her looks, (because it stands to reason that she stinks inside).  I am even more sickened by the assumption that the "plain" girl is destined to live in the shadow of her sister, fighting despair and hopelessness because her only value is her good heart.    Isn't beauty in the eye of the beholder, anyway?  Why confirm the Hollywood perversion of beauty?  It is detrimental to the self-esteem of both girls.  I will find another way to honor the attributes of my daughters without comparing them to one another.  This story, in effect, illustrates that they are both, for differing reasons, inferior to each other.  In addition they are each, at least partly, undesirable to their future husbands. (Neither one is the whole package - pursued for having godly character and God-given sex appeal.)  I love all of Lisa's novels.  Needless to say, I am furious that I wasted my hopes and money on this one.  This storybook won't even be donated to the library.  I have already slipped into the trash.  Suzann 
 I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it! 
 Yancey fills a necessary niche with those who have had experience with church which causes them to fall away and then fill a void that needs filling.  However, his bottom line perspective of worship being God has an audience watching worshippers seeking His presence in their hearts is not what God seeks at all.  God seeks those who worship Him in spirit and in truth.  Thus, where is God in worship?  In our heart?  What would He want with that sin-filled, darkened, old thing?  What He wants is "chesed," Hebrew word for "covenant faithfulness." Our inability totally to do "chesed" caused God to do it for us, incarnate, sacramentally in Christ.  Thus, where is God for us?  In the Gospel preached in its purity and distributed in the sacraments distributed according to His Testament.  Yancey is yet to discover this.  Maybe his void will lead him to this.  Suggest Yancey and others still seeking God would read Gene Vieth's terrific spiritual journey: "The Spirituality of the Cross.&quot 
 As the title says - don't waste your money on this book.  I do not understand the humor in this book.  I thought this was to be an entertaining and helpful book for persons interested in learning the art of hospitality.  There is very little useful information in the book and the oddly inserted humor is distracting.  The author has a thing about teeth (or one tooth)- I don't understand how this relates to the topic at hand.  Also the pictures are from a different era and not inviting nor do they enhance the message.  I find dirty recipe cards unappealing - I don't want to make the food when I have to look at a stained recipe card.  The vagina information has no place in this type of book and detracts from the hospitality message. I really don't understand the purpose of putting it into this book.  The book is not useful as an entertaining guide and not funny as a comedy piece.  
 I don't know anyone would like to read this book unless they are Afrian Americans. In "How Capatalism Underdeveloped Black America," the author writes the only way to achieve economic, political and social development for Blacks is to overthrow Captalist system in United States. As the author said, since the country is dominated by racist, and sexist white Americans, a bloody revolution has to be acted. The first phase of the socialist revolution is voting for progressive and anticapitalist politicians. The second phase is creating a chaotic living condition in America so that government has to cooperate with revoluntists. After the success of the socialist reforms, and totally eliminated captalism in the nation. They are going to support other countries to achieve "equality", too. Our country is going to be working class based nation, with universal health care, volunteer military officers, and equal-paid wage. 
 Okay, you may think that I do not appreciate the so-called classics, but I have to be honest--I simply cannot stand this book. The language is so bad, and even the ending is horrible. The only good thing I can say about the whole thing is that it's very short. It's only a few chapters long, and that's it.   I read this book with my English class in high school, and reading it once was more than enough for me. Not to diss John Steinbeck or anything like that, but this book is one of the worst books in all of literature. I don't even understand why they call this lame piece of work a "classic". 
 For any number of reasons I can probably say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that a lot of people think this is genius. I am not one of them. Personally, I don't find endless descriptions of sex with minority boys to be very entertaining reading, let alone genius. I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.  This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.  This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the "naked" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future. Who reads this and resonates with it? Who thinks, "Yes, gay sex with boys is what my mind is all about? Oh, and all the better that they're Arabs!" Very few people, the author included. Burroughs himself admits this was difficult to write. This is probably due to the fact that the vignettes portrayed here do not, in fact, represent anything so much as the anarchy resplendent in the author's own mind while he struggled with various addictions. As a case study in heroin and morphine addiction, this may have some merit. As a counterculture commentary on society I find it worthless.  This isn't about my sensibilities being assaulted - far from it. If I can read & enjoy Robbins's linguistic forays into sex with nuns, I can handle just about anything. I'm not offended with flying sperm so much as I am insulted that anyone felt this was worth reading; that I was lured into thinking this was a work of art. It's not.   Sometimes I read books that don't suit me, but I understand why someone would like it. This book falls squarely in the camp where people feel they need to proclaim it genius because they're so confused or intimidated by it. This book is far from genius. The author admits it was put together from scraps of things written while he was in his heavy heroin addiction, and that he vaguely remembers much of it. I don't see how, or in what context, this book will appeal to anyone other than a case study of a certain segment of people at a certain instance in time in America 
 I TOTALLY agree with "A Reader" that posted on January 10, 2004... titled." What Would Sue Monk Kidd Do?" This reviewer captured my thoughts exactly. WHY would anyone want to read a spiritual book written by a woman who abandoned her Christianity? Please! This author has one book that is good..."The Secret Life of Bees," and it's fiction! Stick with fiction, Ms. Kidd. You seem to do it in your own spiritual life, so writing it should be simple. 
 I kept reading the book, hoping to find one of the stories that really would have a profound impact on me. It just didn't "happen" for me. Most of the stories have very predictible outcomes 
 I have NEVER posted a review here before, but I was so disappointed in this DVD that I just had to speak on it.   Ok, this is a reissue of this DVD and it is missing so many skits from the original that it isn't even funny.  Just a few of the missing skits: 1.  Kill the white people.  2.  There are NO Gumby skits. 3.  There is only one Mr Robinson's Neighborhood skit where there should have been three. 4.  White people slavery town with Stevie Wonder. There are more, but I can't name them all.  If you can find the ORIGINAL buy it and buy it quickly.  You will laugh until you wet yourself.  You will remember what the golden age of SNL was really about.  Don't waste your money on this poor imitation.   
 I had no knowledge and little confidence about my ability to create a web page. Just a desire.  This broke down the ends and outs of creating a web page and showed me just how easy it is. Unfortunately, it has my confidence soaring right now and now I believe I can get a job in the web page creation business but I know where my talents lie 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 Hansen doesn't quite get it. He looks at the Indian political scence using Eurocentric categories, without caring to analyze the control the bureaucracy holds on the strings of power and the alienation of wide classes of people. His arguments explaining the rise of the Hindu parties are not convincing. He has not examined the effect that Pakistani policies and the contiuing Islamic terrorism have had on Hindu morale 
 Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, "Okay, give it your best shot!"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn 
 We bought this for our 7-year old for Christmas. We are dissapointed in the quality. The mat is flimsy and so creased from being in the package that it will not lay flat. The headset feels "cheap" also. The video is VERY difficult, especially for a child. The "dancers" don't use much vocabulary to help the child get started. They just start dancing and expect the kid to keep up. It's VERY fast. I even had trouble following along. Our daughter was so frustrated, she cried. I do not recommend it for young children, especially those with little or no prior dance experience 
 I found this book disappointing. Its pages drag on and on but never deal with the topic. It addresses why, but not the how. I was looking for the how 
 I bought this off of the New York Public Library website.  What an utter waste of $40.  The book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful, but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while.  The worst part is the "software" that you are supposed to use to catalog your books.  First of all, it is difficult to install--this is always a sign of a inferior product: no product that was properly QA'd would be released in such condition.  Second of all, the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet.  I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software.  You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book.  There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data.  I state again: it is very surprising that the New York Public Library would include this product in their stores.  It is a major, major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there.  The product I finaly ended up using is one called Readerware (http://www.readerware.com/).  Readerware, for the same amount of money ($40), allows you to scan in the barcodes of your books--the software comes with its own CueCat scanner.  Then the software looks up the barcodes you entered, (using the Internet),  and updates each barcode with all the available info on the book. I scanned 800+ books in about 4-5 hours.  BTW, you can also use Readerware to scan in all of your DVDs and CDs, (you have to pay more to get the full version of Readware that supports books, DVDs, and CDs).  Of course, you don't have to take my recommendation to buy "Readerware", but please don't waste your money on "Your Home Library. 
   I purchased this *kit* based on the fact it had ideas, activities ... etc.  Maybe me having ADD I missed some info on it?  When I got it I was surprised to find it was a book!  Not a *kit* at all.  So I will probably never use it ... unless I was to purchase a copier machine and print off items as needed. I have read some of it and it had good ideas and info.  Just not what I had purchased it for at all!  = 
 Frosty is a perfect classic as always.  Great story and characters.  But, boy Frosty Returns makes this one you should probably skip.  First, the story and songs are weak. Second, Christmas isn't even mentioned. The directors have fallen for the left wing anti-Christmas agenda, resulting in the kids school having a "Winter Carnival" instead. Pathetic. The real Frosty would melt with anger. 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 I had hoped that people were done defecating on Asimov's grave when the last of Roger MacBride Allen's Caliban trilogy came out, but no such luck. Instead, this stupid "ibooks" imprint - having already desecrated  Alfred Bester's memory - now bring this awful series back into print.  Worse, they expect us to pay trade paperback prices for this dreck. Avoid  like the plauge - buy REAL Asimov books instead 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.   Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.  There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden 
 She seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i.e. much of today's pentecostalism/charasmatics i.e. the toronto/brownsville blessing (a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic) and hollywood.   In studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine. It was just get saved and jesus loves you. A cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow.  
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 I've just taken my real estate exam in Illinois, and I can tell you this book is completely useless with the sole exception of the first couple of chapters.  The introductory chapter is good, and the questions to ask a hiring broker are excellent. All that said, that is about all that is good about this book. I'm rating it at 2 stars just because of the first chapters.  Mentions scripts for 50 some odd occasions, and none of the scripts are in the book. Wow, what am I supposed to do now? Obviously, this is just a book going on a good title and providing little if any content.   Read Danielle Kennedy's books and you will a marked contrast in the types of information you are given here. Now some of the information in Kennedy's books may be a little outlandish, but they are not right-out-wrong, or missing entirely.  - Sea 
 I am an avid reader and could not make it through this book. His other books were so good. I could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be. In applying some of the recommended techniques, my 11 year old daughter, Emily, thought I lost my mind. Thank goodness things are back to normal. We are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice 
 This is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter.  The suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out.  The suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big (duh) and then group like items together (duh) that's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other.  Also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system.  Oh is that affordable? If I had $75,000 to redo my kitchen I would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins.  Come on, don't waste your money on this book or it's suggestions.  Very few pictures and all for the rich.  I thought Good Housekeeping was for the everyday family.  Get it at the library and then return it after you don't read it.  
 The writing is good from a technical standpoint (I don't have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well).  The idea is a good one too.  What I can't get past is the character Robert Langdon.  Langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second.  Another thing I have trouble with is Dan Brown's knack for slowing the pace of the story.  Things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense.  The problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff.  Like playing fetch with a dog, you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest, especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it's finally tossed.    This book is an easy read but I think it is a bit over-rated.  
 While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very "nasal" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare 
 Ok, this chair is fine except for two very important things.  One: the tray is huge, and not in a good way, in a really hard to clean and maneuver kind of way. Also, the two trays that fit on top, that are dishwasher safe, ARE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE DISHWASHER!!! So what's the point??? Two: it has the little thing that separates the legs on the TRAY, rather than on the chair...making it impossible to set down anywhere when it's full of food and your baby is yelling to get out of the chair.  Everything else, about the chair is great, but you can find these other features in just about any other high chair.  I'm bought the one that's made by the famous toy maker, and love it 
 While I myself had not actually read the book, the problems I see with this work is tautologically apparent.  PIAS works on an objective, logical truth that far exceeds mankinds framed reference of what can be epistemically available.  Recent works have started to combine the gap between current science, and the emerging postmodernist methodologies to create a holistically balanced approach (I refer the reader to  Sokal 1996).  Our job as subjective viewers is to wait in the sidelines until the field codifies itself, but until then, reserve judgement.  
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it 
 This rather disparate and dis-appointing collection of essay.  The author's main contention is to demonstate that there is no Islam only islams... the demonstration is done by asseration rather than argument.  The author seems to think that an opaque writing style will compensate for the analytical rigour the book so clearly lacks. Thus we have a strange brew- an attempted deconstruction of Islamism in the name of an essentialized universalism.  Critique of Islamism for its essentialism becomes nothing more than a rhetorical act rather a theoritical position 
 I loved this Cordless headset until I found another that was under fifty bucks which was just as good.  (R*dio S***k 
 I purchased this item for my son's birthday.  Not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it.  Also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly.  After a couple of  days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min. successful flight.    On the second day, after 15 mins of recharging the battery, the battery case and wires melted.  Have contacted company for a refund.  
 There was no "0 star" to rate this book. Someone wrote your innane comments were "South Park" but that was giving you more credit than due.  This book knocks rooms decorated with "mod," "hippy," "psychedelic," primary, analogous, complementary, or accented neutral colors; functional autonomous rooms combining sports, hobbies, recreation, and academic dimensions within one room; it knocks the budget-conscious decorations of the handmade, handpainted, functional, antique, dime store, yard sale, thrift or expensive furniture stores; it slams grouped wall, shelf decorations used as room accents: keys, Americana cushions, books, candle holders, fruit in a bowl, potted plants; criticizes large eye-catching "centers of interest" used with living room furniture, sun face wall painting, "Abe Lincoln with butterfly bowtie," large eye over purple tub; the accented neutral black/white/yellow bedroom with Colonial style poster bed, Queen Anne chair, rocking chair, possibly Ethan Allen, round table may be possibly an old wooden construction cable spool covered with home sewn tablecloth; cubist, geometric, fractal wall decorations; use of light through uncovered windows, sheer curtains, roll-up wooden blinds, tie-back sheer curtains; and repainting an antique chair to accent a child's room.  I would not purchase nor recommend this book nor anything else written by this author.    
 The authors have made a great effort writing this book, which is divided up in two parts: macro- and microeconomics. It gives insight of how we should understand current economic affairs on both the macronomical and micronomical levels. The book does serve this purpose quite well. I particularly liked the summary at the end of each chapter. The book does however lack in solid economic theory, which makes this book inconsistent. If you are an economics student I would not recommend it for you to actually study economics (there are better books around for that), but merely as a reference to understand that theory is what you learn at univerity, and understanding the theory in practice comes usually afterwards. The big lack of this book is that it is only based from an American point of view and thus is not very useful for anyone living outside the US. Even the international economics chapter won't satisfy your desire to really understand what's is actually going on (when you don't live in the US). What this book totally fails to point out is that the US economy is very different to most other economies in the world. On the whole two stars were awarded for this book, as I think that it is very useful to  help your understand the current economic affairs. At the same time it fails in providing solid economic theory, it is based far too much on the US economy, and it is incomplete on other parts. Yet, if you live in the US, are studying economics and want to understand what it all means in practice, this book will help you! If not, don't bother 
 I recently bought this "Literary Classics" edition of "The  Diaries of Adam & Eve" expecting it to be the text of the  wonderful audiobook version of Twain's stories, as read by Betty Buckley  and Mandy Patinkin, only to find that it is not the same at all.  This  version is just a replica of the original books and does not include the  full text as heard on the audiobook.  Then I found the version I wanted,  subtitled "Translated by Mark Twain" and it, like the audiobook  version, is really something special.  To anyone interested in these  wonderful "first family" stories, I recommend searching for the  Fair Oaks Press edition 
 I would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds, I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one-sided ones as well. The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).  The book covers a wide variety of topics, some are puzzeling. While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer. I was pretty upset to read that, I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.  This book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows. This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information, guess that backfired Pearlman. In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.  The book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back, most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources), so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.  The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people, they like to find good stories. That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it. Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now. Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.  So once again, the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground. This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires, ran into the stands to attack people, slept with hookers, drank all the time, was mean to Lou Gherig, etc.  While that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste, just like this 
 Having lived for more than six years in Japan, and being fluent in Japanese, I have a quite clear idea of the society there. This book is not only too old, but it shows that Reischauer (like the other members of the Chrysantemum Club) has a one-sided point of view, and is still ganging with the American "reformists" that put Japan back on the rails (so to say...) during the occupation. Of course Reishauer knows quite a lot about Japan, but he tells only what he thinks is important to him and to his old-fashion Orientalist group. Read any Murakami or Yoshimoto to understand on your own how this book is very superficial. There are much better and objective introductions to the complex Japanese reality 
 I bought this book with the hopes of having a great bedtime story for my kids.  I was greatly disappointed. While this book has some of the very best drawings of African American children I have ever seen.  It has no story what-so-ever. I'm stunned at the fact that two women are listed under "written by."  It took TWO people to write this? I'm in the wrong business!!! If you want a nice story to read to your kids - this book is not for you.  But, if you are willing to create your own story based on magnificent illustrations - buy this book.  My 2 stars are for the drawings alone.  The wording gets a ZERO from me! 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 I bought this movie on recommendation from other customers here on Amazon.com ... okay, I bought this movie because Viggo Mortensen was in it :O)  And boy, I just shouldn't have bothered.  What a weak script.  The characters are formulaic, the dialogue wooden and cliched.  There are no surprises, no insights - I came away from this movie not caring if the entire camp blew up.    Perhaps this is a difference in cultures, I'm not sure, but as an Australian I found this movie to be sickeningly Disneyesque in its portrayals.  Not worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of your time over - even for Viggo 
 Book is decently written and information logically presented. However, it does not really provide adequate details for application of techniques.  It indicates that basic obedience is the fundamental method of correcting dogs who show aggression, but does not give adequate in-depth specifics to support the title's promise 
 ...it is very poorly researched.  The map on the cover is wrong for starters.  This is Mediterranean food according to Joanne Weir (not a person who grew up with Med food) who obviously has a very shallow understanding of the food of the region.  This book proves that breezing through these countries as a tourist can not turn you into a serious cookbook author, or even a half-way decent one.   .. 
 I started ordering Glamour 2 months ago, and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me. There are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable. Ladies, my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..I dont recommend Glamour at all. 
 I bought this book for my father; a national review I had read made me think it would be funny and a little crude, a good guy book.  I can't give it to him!  Way too many "F" words, just nasty in places.  I don't know...I think guys at a stag party would blush if they read it 
 I teach drama/theater in a low income public school. I bought the book because my school has very few resources and I thought this might be useful. As it turned out the book was hardly used during my first year teaching. My biggest problem with this book is that it is not very user friendly for a teacher who just wants to add some fun to a class but not a complex game. In other words the book needs to make the games simpler so the kids can pick them up faster and have more fun. This might not be problem for teachers in high school as your students might be more mature and able to handle more complex games. But for middle school teachers tread lightly. Also if you have a bunch of behavior problems in your class then forgot about it. In my experience I found the worse the behavior the better they were at spoiling fun classroom games. Be warned 
 We bought this microwave to accomodate our small counter.  We figured instead of buying a toaster and a microwave, we could just get this one appliance.  Wrong.  Although it does toast and microwave, it does neither well.  Toasting takes forever and you never get a "toasty, brown" color.  The surface of the bread/bagel just gets dried out.  It does microwave but it takes a long time.  The biggest disappointment, though, was that it does not work at all on microwave popcorn.  Most of the kernals remain unpopped while those that do pop burn as does the bag.  After a few months with this product, we're buying another microwave 
 I thought this book was awful. The more you read, the clearer it becomes that Prasso approached her "research" with a pre-formed thesis, and either picks subjects to prop it up or filters their comments appropriately.  The author's condescension is annoying as heck. She's blatantly disdainful of some of her interviewees, like a sniveling Filipina prostitute, a white man living with a Chinese runway model, and a Chinese school administrator who - gasp! - admits she wants to get married and stop chasing promotions. Scoring an interview with the famous retired geisha Mineko Iwasaki is an accomplishment, certainly, but Prasso's self-congratulatory tone ruins it.  Argh I've totally lost patience with this book, I just wrote a review of it for a different website. Full review on my blog here if you're interested: [...]  As a Malaysian Chinese girl in a relationship a white American guy, I have a vested interest in arguing against Prasso's typifying of all Asian/white relationships being based on either unilateral or mutual exploitation. I'm not dating him because I want a green card, he's not dating me because he thinks I'm going to be docile and compliant - quite the opposite, in both cases. We like each other because we're frigging NERDS (science grad students bonding over SG-1 and Firefly).   As one of the young Japanese women interviewed says, "Junin toiro!" - Ten people, ten colours, yet this book tries to paint everyone with the same brush 
 Uptight guy versus bringer of joy and light. Fun food against staid religion. Haven't I seen this before? Oh yes, it was a Disney Film. I like the recipes, but the story is so hackneyed it had to be made into a movie. Death is even personified in this book; what an original idea! I read to the end because I love chocolate, but otherwise, this tedious heap of cliche is exactly what's wrong with "literature" today and doesn't merit recommendation 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
 After anticipating the arrival of this book (that I ordered some time before publication after hearing of it), I was disappointed.  Although the subject is timely, the writing style smacks of academia and therefore, will not appeal to the mainstream (reader).  Because I'm tenacious by nature, I finished the book, but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention.  Too bad - it could have been inspirational 
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending 
 This book has generated so much hype, and yet I fail to see how a Christian cannot be other than offended at the way Tenney treats the Bible. I picked this up to read, as it was recommended to me by a number of people, and I put it down again after the first chapter. He talks about the Bible as God's 'old love letters to the church' and defines a God-chaser as someone who is not content 'to camp out on some dusty old truth known to everyone'. I have listened to him preach at a conference and the same derogatory approach to the Bible and its doctrine was evident. So Scripture is not enough? Historic doctrine is inferior to Tenney's direct revelations? The teaching of Scripture is just dusty old truth, not the living word but 'old love letters'? Sorry, but this is nothing but plain mysticism. Tommy Tenney might think he has privileged access to new revelations and experiences of God above and beyond Scripture, but I don't accept it and have no intention of reading a book that so denigrates Scripture. Looks to me like nothing other than a revival of gnosticism 
  Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.   The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.   Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness 
 As a cat lover, I've enjoyed the Cat Who... books immensely.  However, this book left me with a lot of questions, and there were several items mentioned that were never resolved.  Homer Tibbet had been a prominent character in many of that series of books, he dies, and that's the last mention of him.  Surely, James MacIntosh Qwilleran would have attended his funeral!  Same thing for Liz Hart.  She's killed in a car accident, and that's the last we hear of her.  What about the impact of her death on Derek Cuttlebrink,another prominent character in this series?  We've read all these books, these characters have become important to us, and suddenly we're left hanging in these relationships.  I'll continue to read the new books, but they're clearly not what they were even 3 or 4 years ago 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 I read this years ago for a class I was taking. It was awful, but required.  At the same time I was working the night shift in a psychiatric hospital.  The book bears absolutely no resemblence to the real world of mental illness.   If you have to read this book for a course, hopefully you will then move on to a more interesting and useful class.   If you want realism, try Ken Kesey's "One flew over the Cookoo's nest".  Everyone I was working with at the state hospital read this book, then the local college produced it. A lot of the patients were taken to see the play and they loved it. (This was before "patients" became "clients").  The movie gave me nightmares; I saw it after I left the hospital and it was too real.  The mental health field has of course changed considerably since the 70's and a lot of those people are now out on the streets talking to themselves.  Unfortunately Szasz is a classic theorist and this book will still continue to be read 
 I like this humidifier alot but now I cannot find replacement filters for it. I only had it for about 3 months and now I cannot find replacement filters. This unit was not cheap either, it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating. I would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only 
 I have been trying to buy a new - accurate scale. This one supposedly weighs to .2 lbs. My current scale is consintently 2 pounds under my gyms and doctors scale. This one showed up and I was hoping for an acurate scale. It is 4-8 pounds over my gym scale and worse yet varies by 5 pounds within 3 minutes. What good is .2 pounds on the reading when it varies by 5 pounds within minutes. It is going back to Amazon. So much for German engineering. 
 Decent starting point for cooking-impaired college students if they don't mind eating eggs and potatoes often.  A little more variation in the recipes would be nice as well as some pointers on how to substitute ingredients and an explanation on why some ingredients do (What is the purpose of using cornstarch?  I know, some of it is common sense, but heyyyyyyy.... I'm a stupid college student). For example, for one recipe for frying chicken, I used pork and it tasted fine.     Also, some of the recipes don't really work.  Baking chicken drumsticks at 375 degrees in the oven for 40 minutes is not enough for thoroughly cooked chicken.     On the upside, the cooking tips were really helpful.  The book could use more of those, like be aware that if you heat oil, it pops and it could land on your face or burn your arm.  Overall, this book provides some ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it too much.  Not really worth the purchase.  Flip through it in the bookstore like I did and save some bucks for uhhh.... buying food. = 
 I have to say I agree with the prev. poster; this is just awful. Can you say "Norman Bates," people? Mom crawling on the floor to get into the kid's room? Weird.   The idea of the decrepit old mom being rocked to sleep by the grown man was so profoundly creepy I don't know where to begin. I'm surprised the next page wasn't Mom in a casket. *shudder*  Yes; these are some wonderful themes of acceptance, stages of life, etc FOR ADULTS. 
 Now that Professor Chasteen's personal friends, ex-students, and professional connections have had their say, perhaps a dash of insight would be relevant. This is a lousy book, in part because the premise is ludicrous. There cannot be a concise history of Latin America for the same reason that there cannot be a concise rendering of Newton's Principia. Thus, what professor Chasteen has provided is a concise overview of his personal prejudices, the vast majority of which he directs against (and here's a surprise) the United States and Europe. That these prejudices are personal is evident from the dedication (in which he states that his Latin American children are improving the US simply by their presence) until the meandering, pointless fizzling out of his discussion 250 pages later. The history is mediocre, at best, and some of Chasteen's opinions are so ridiculous (anyone historian who singles out the Carter administration's foreign policies for admiration has been hitting the bong a little too hard) that you have to wonder why he continues to live in a country he so plainly abhors.  The writing is so saturated with neoliberal condescension that professor Chasteen's acknowledgement to the over 100 students who read the manuscript seems a wholly fitting exercise, given that they may well have written the dreadful thing 
 This book is just an overview of computer animation. You can't learn anything from it. I was hoping for a vanilla instruction book because I own Carrara and Hexagon and I have to buy Maya or Lightwave books and try to adapt them to Carrara and Hexagon. The pictures inside aren't that great either - the cover has the best characters. For the money, I would rather have bought another Maya or Lightwave book 
 This book repeatedly emphasizes that germs are mean and that they are everywhere and that their sole purpose is to GET YOU. Very scary, actually. It puts them in your body, in your food, in the air and the miminally addressed topic of keeping yourself clean does not banish them. The next page just puts them all back somewhere else. It is not clear at all that handwashing, not letting other people sneeze on you, washing the floor, not leaving food overnight on the counter are effective ways to keep healthier. The emphasis is on a ton of very cute cartoony germs in multitudes. The health aspects are implied only--and poorly at that. Behaviors like nose-picking are RIDICULED. Not good for kids up to about age 10, especially if you're trying to teach health and cleanliness issues 
 Maybe I was expecting too much out of this text, but I simply did find anything here that was either apologetic or even semi-compelling. This book is an assessment, as in an exposition, of certain facets/tenets of freewill theism (open theism). However, Basinger left too much to my imagination. In other words, Basinger covered only a few things that an open theist would have to account for in their overall theology (i.e. the problem of evil, divine omniscience, and petitionary prayer). What was left out was a thorough assessment of the attributes God according to the freewill theists. For instance, is God in time or eternal (immutable or mutable)? If God is temporal how does that affect freewill theism's view of divine omniscience? The notion of God being temporal certainly has significant ramifications on His knowing future contingents. While I already know the answers to these question via reading other freewill theists, had this been the first freewill theist book I had read, these things would not have been answered for me. Why? This is a crucial question, especially since this book totes to be a philosophical assessment of the issues.  Furthermore, to what extent does freewill theism limit God? While Basinger briefly covered omniscience, this section left me wanting (it was too empty in content). However, I did think Basinger's criticisms of MK (middle knowledge) were interesting (pp. 43-48). I must point out though that MK was misrepresented on page 89. Basinger claims that "If God possess MK, Hasker informs us, then he intentionally brings about each event that actually occurs." This is not MK as it was espoused by it's originator, namely Luis de Molina (see Freddoso's translation titled "On Divine Foreknowledge.") This book was not so much a case for freewill theism as it was an exposition of certain theological tenets. I wish Basinger would have been a little more direct and detailed for his reader and given a clearer assessment of the whole freewill thought. It almost seemed as if he was afraid to just come out and declared the limitations and changes that freewill theists have place on the God of the Bible 
 This book is most appropriate for someone who has just entered the workforce.  Many of the lessons regarding behavior in the professional world are useful, but not profound.  I was  dissapointed in the section of the book devoted to personal matters.  In general, I would not recommend to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of basic personal financial skills.  
 I enjoyed everything I've read from Robert Heinlein.  This book had lots of potential and I liked the concept but hated the voice of the story.  It was like he was getting lazy, sounded bombastic and I hated it.  I cherish books but this one went into the nasty garbage can at work, only ever threw away one other book and it was worse but it went in the garbage for the same reason, I read for stories not to hear an author try to show off how famous or witty he can be. 
 I'm really trying to finish this book simply because it's not so engrossing that I'd ever miss my stop on mny daily commute.  There is nothing scary about this book besides the day-to-day horror of working in a bookstore (of which I can speak first-hand).  It drags so much you wish something awful would hurry up and happen just so you don't have to deal with such boring characters and lack of storyline any longer.  
 Andersen misleads the reader when he markets this book as a book about Caroline Kennedy. In fact this author does nothing more than re-hash everything that has already been written about the family. He sells it as a book about Caroline simply because he constantly uses the possessive form of her name to refer to the actual main characters in this book (Caroline's mother, Caroline's brother, Caroline's father etc.).After reading this book, I realized that this is because Caroline has lived a rather simple and scandel free life. The only remarkable thing about Caroline's life is that it's not that remarkable. Like so many Americans, she cooks her children breakfast every morning, video tapes their school pageants, and considers being their mom her most rewarding job in life. Caroline is to be commended for her stellar academic record and her accomplishments as an author. However, without the last name "Kennedy" no one would find her life particularly compelling reading. There simply isn't enough provacative information out there to fill up an entire book about Caroline alone. Unlike her mother, she wasn't first lady of the United States, married to one of the most beloved presidents, she didn't hold up an entire nation during three of the darkest days in our nation's history, she didn't marry a wealthy shipping magnate from whom she inherited 26 million dollars  and then went on to parlay that money into 200 million. I could go on and on about Jackie but in the interest of brevity, I think you've got the picture. That said, I believe Mr. Andersen has done a great disservice to his reader when he sold them a book complete with the tacit implication that we were to really learn who Caroline Kennedy was as a person. The information may well be out there but Mr. Andersen has yet to find it.     
 Good story, terrible writing.  Anderson's prose is trite, unimaginative, and, far too often, simply laughable.  Which is a shame because the story is compelling.  This is a key part of the Star Wars extended universe, however. So, read it if you must.  But you've been warned 
 I know this play is suppose to be a classic and a master of it's genre. But if this is the best this genre can produce, this genre must be worse than "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The play is trite and cliched. It's whole meaning is that everything is meaningless. Is it just me or is that a bit ironic? Unless you have to read this play for school, don't read it. If I had gone to see this play in a theatre I would have walked out after 5 minuntes. Why can't people write good and decent plays like Shakespeare or Sophoclese. (I know I spelled them wrong, Sorry.) This new genre of pointless dialogue is, well, pointless. I wonder if all of these playwrites are writing these plays and laughing at the fools that think they are good. Beckett is probably laughing in his grave because he is still fooling people. If you like non-sense, and you like to look like you are philisophical, go ahead and read it, but don't say you weren't warned 
 Anyone who bashes Depeche Mode has no taste in music. In fact, anyone who likes this bullsh*t Punk music has no taste in music. DM are a classic band, and everyone has a fave DM song. Ever heard "Enjoy the Silence", "Never Let Me Down", "Personal Jesus", "Just Can't Get Enough", or "It's No Good"? Do you own Music for the Masses, Violator, and Black Celebration? If not, you can't call yourself a music fan. Manny_Moses, what's your fave DM song? Oops, Manny_Moses likes The Used. What a sh*tty druggie band.  Just buy a Depeche album. Perhaps if you own all Depeche Mode's records, might I suggest a REM album? Yes, I will. Buy REM's Monster and Automatic for the People as wel 
 I am presently in a MBA program and have been forced to use this book for our intermediate financial decison class. I have found it to be of very little help and actually muddles things more than clarifying or explaining finances. I have bought 3 other financial books in order to understand the class, all of them better written and far cheaper. This book is terrible in its' semi-explanations of financial formulas. Trying to tie these formulas and examples into any sort of problem application is almost impossible. If you end up having to use this book for a class, you must be prepared to spend a lot more time and money  in searching for books that will truly do the job right 
 There are a few funny sections to this book but overall it is negative.  A lot of us infertility patients deal with our own emotions - positive and negative - on a minute by minute basis.  I don't think this book helps lift your overall mood. 
 an insufferable view of life among a claque of ruskie girlfriends from the late 50s to the late 70s. nothing more than "sex & the city" transplanted to moscow in the khruschev and brezhnev eras -- if thats your cup of borscht, more power to you 
 A friend of mine recommended I read about this clown on the net and I started to believe it.  That was until Mr. Titor himself said in his posts that he had nothing to sell. Lo and behold, what did I find here for $14.99?  SOMEONE is making a buck! Or did Mr. Titor open a checking account to have his money from book sales wired to 2036? I don't buy it...He could have least told us who won Dancing with the stars, so I could spoil the surprise and not have to sit and watch it with my girlfriend!!   
 Mike Mignola's comic books are great.  You should buy them instead of this overpriced collection of Mignola art.  The very thing that makes Hellboy so beautiful, the simplicity and elegance of design, means that looking at a Mignola sketch is exactly like looking at a finished comic book panel, except you can see the India ink brush marks in the black areas, and there is no supporting narrative thrust to give the picture meaning.  The same goes for his pencils (of which there are few included- I don't think this guy makes a mark on paper without inking and publishing it).  There is not even a discussion of Mignola's sources or inspirations, no bibliography of the occult (oh, I forgot, we're living in post-literate America).  There is no insight to be gained by investing in the Art of Hellboy, because it is just a sampler of beautifully designed panels that look better in the comic books 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Sweetie, written and directed by award winning filmmaker, Jane Campion best known for the film "The Piano" is the story about a young couple in a distant relationship. One day the womans mentally ill sister Dawn "Sweetie" breaks into their house and lives with them. She is not on her medication and creates havoc. When her father visits after his wife leaves him, he tries to calm her but is unsuccessful.   It is never mentioned what kind of illness Dawn has. I thought the film was too graphic and recommend eaisliy offended people not watch it.  The DVD has some great special features. There is a theatrical trailer, behind the scenes photos, audio commentary by director Jane Campion and director of photography, Sally Bongers and screenwriter Gerard Lee. There are interviews with lead actresses, Genevieve Lemon and Karen Colston. There is a 1989 conversation between Campion and film critic Peter Thompson made after the success of her short films.   Finally, there are 3 of her short films made as a student. The first film, An Exercise in Discipline: Peel, is about a man and his son and sister out for a drive. The son has trown orange peels out the window and his father stops the car and demands he pick them up. The second film, Passionless Moments; is a series of short scenes about various situations. The third film, A Girl's Own Story, is about schoolgirls who do various activities.  This film is ok but is not appropriate for children 
 I recently read this book for a ELAN class @ UGA. I thought it was terrible and pointless. The characters lack depth and the theme of the book is not developmentally appropriate for 7th or 8th graders. The book was around 100 pages and leaves the reader wishing he had done something better with his time. My professor scolded me for not wanting to read this book to my future classes. She claimed I was scared to read books to my kids. (I guess she is refering to the religious implications in the book) She is absolutely right. I am terrified to read bad books to my students. 
 First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract.   My conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics.   As others have said in this review forum. This book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing.   This book has a few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent.   Dont waste your money or time. I am so happy I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale! 
 As usual, Robert Duvall's acting was phenomenal - why I purchased the movie - BUT the movie itself was pointless and boring.  My husband and I fell asleep.....when we woke up Robert Duvall's character was dead!  Enough said 
 I'd call myself a pretty big Bodycount fan, and most people I know think that BC are a joke and ask me how I can like them.  The first three discs were excellent.  I like "Drive By", "Bowels of the Devil" "Dead Man Walking" as my favorite songs from their first 3 albums which were excellent. This disc, man I remember buying BC Violent Demise the day it came out the same with Born Dead when it came out, and I don't feel anything at all for this disc.  I'll probably never listen to this disc again except out of obligation to the fact that I bought it, so that it would be alongside my other BC cds.  The mixing is painfully bad, so much so that it interferes with all enjoyment of the disc.  There is no guitar prescence whatsoever.  The drum sound sounds almost like it was played on an electronic kit than a beefy live sound.  Ice-T's vocals are way, way, WAY too loud in the mix.  Which is unfortunate because it doesn't complement the songs, it just makes you real, real, sick of Ice after a few minutes.  He's cool when he's talking about politics and terror and other street topics, but when there are more and more songs per BC album where Ice T is crooning/singing literally off key about trying to get girls, it makes you real embarassed for him that the song got that bad.  Back to the production, whoever was at the mixing board on this disc was high.  Everything about this release stinks "Bad bootleg" including the horrible cover art, but sad but true, we waited 8-9 years for a new album that was a total disappointment.

 These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance 
 I am halfway through this book and I am already so annoyed by the references of "international gesture"...the first two three times it was somehow funny...I am now on page 164 ..and she still keeps on using it..that is quite a turn off...repeting stuff over and over again...also, why does she has to refer to the singers always as "the popular singer John Lennnon", "the popular singer Leonard Cohen"....small details like this made me quite annoyed while reading the book...and most of the jokes are not really that funny...I think it is still readable...but I must say that I have to put some effort to finish it... 
 In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!        
 The Spirit of Laws is a passionate and eloquent statement of liberalism. But it is only that: a statement. It is not a defence. Montesquieu rails against despotism and carefully spells out the separation of government powers. But, unlike Locke or Mill, he gives little argument for why liberalism should be accepted. And those few sketchy comments he does give (e.g. despotism is bad even for the despot) are unconvincing 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 my main problem with this cup is the lid is absurdly difficult to get on. I was amazed at how much trouble I had considering this is a name brand cup. I suspected the problem could be me, so I handed it off to a male to see if he would have equal trouble as well - and he did.  The cap on top of the lid takes so long to coax into place that the only way I've deemed this cup usable is to just leave it closed all the time. Other than that the cup seems to be fine. The markings (c, oz, and ml) are clear and readable. It is also easy to clean (if using protein powder it is probably best to rinse it out right away), though I cannot say how it fares in a dishwasher. If you do not want a cup that is a hassle to put together and you are just making simple shakes, you will probably want to look elsewhere. 
 If your looking for the old Deryni action, the clash of arms, the onslaught of repressed mental powers, you won't find it here. This is primarily a romance novel; you know, which princess will be married to which "powerful knight, prince, etc,. at the behest of the King. What little action there is, is given short shrift. You really have to go back to the early novels of the Deryni to get much action (The Chronciles of the Dernyi, Volumes 1-4.) Most of the more recent novels of the Deryni are actually romantic novels in disguise 
 Here is yet another alarmist tome by an author who can't seem to see the truth that is exploding all around him.  I suppose I can be considered a fundamentalist.  I believe that because the scripture compels me to "love my neighbor just as I love myself" that I should actually do everything in my power to do just that.  I know hundreds of other fundamentalists and I am dismayed by these books from journalists or commentators who are clearly secular if not agnostic/atheist in their world view who attempt to analyze the state of fundamentalism. How absurd.  It's alike a rich white kid from Beverly Hills writing books about the pitfalls of being a welfare mother in Compton.    Sam Harris also writes with apocalyptic alarm about the millenarianism of fundamentalist Christians.  He loves to cite studies which show that a large percentage of Christians believe in the imminent return of Jesus Christ.  The scares the pants off of people like Harris and Gorenberg because they immediately conclude that every decision made by such believers is based on their belief in the imminent return of Christ.  This is complete nonsense.  Yes fundamentalist believe that Christ will return and many think it will be in their lifetime (though very many do not believe this) but they still have retirement funds and 30 year mortgages.  They still have babies and plan for their college expenses.  This belief does not change anything about ones day-to-day life because any good Christian knows that one can never discern the day or the hour of His return. Most fundamentalists that I know do not have a unified or comprehensive understanding of Revelations and most of them clearly recognize the oblique and metaphorical nature of the book.  To suggest that people are voting for a President based on anything from the book of Revelations is total fabrication.  If that happens, it is anomalous at best and certainly would not weigh significantly on an election.  Christians vote for many reasons and the irreligionists might be surprised to find that there is a great deal of diversity of opinions in fundamentalists' circles when it comes to politics.  They speak of the religious right as if it is a monolithic body receiving its marching orders from Falwell and Dobson.     What is even stranger to me is that there exists in the world today a belief system with more than a billion adherents and by all accounts hundreds of millions of fundamentalists which plainly does advocate a doctrine which is dangerous and which is bringing death, dismemberment, slavery, inequality, and brutality to wide swaths of planet earth.  These people are commanded by their god to "make war on the unbelievers who live around you." (Sura 9:123) and they are doing that with a horrific fervor.  This doesn't alarm anyone?  Even within a stones throw of these bloodthirsty zealots who are rewarded in heaven for being psychopathic killers, journalists like Gorenberg continue to feel that the more dangerous belief is that Christians in America believe the New Testament (which has none of the incitements to violence which fill the Quran).  Christians aren't exploding buses full of innocent people, or blowing up soldiers' convoys, or cheering wildly on 9/11, or oppressing women, or beheading people and taping it to send to the adoring fans.  These horrible right wingers are not denying girls the right to be educated or committing genocide and slavery in Darfur and they aren't really killing or hurting anyone.  The Christian right wing is in fact sending millions of dollars and thousands of missionaries to the poorest nations on earth to build hospitals, provide clean water, repair schools, and give tons of food and medicine away. They live lives of self-sacrifice to be teachers, nurses, doctors, and pastors to the poorest of the poor.  I am in utter dismay to understand books like this and I wish that such authors would just say from the start: "this is an op ed piece....I am attempting to find justification for my own far left, West-hating views and as a sideline, I've never met a Palestinian I didn't like (with bombs strapped on or without).  In Palestine today, more than 80% of the school children when asked what they want to be when they grow up, say that they want to be suicide bombers.  Yes, but Christians are the real problem! 
 Do not buy this book! The editing (yes, the editing) is terrible. There are spelling errors, missing words and repeated words throughout the book. Captions for many of the photographs are irrelevant or almost exact repeats of the picture next to it.   The actual text needs another draft. Sentences are often awkward and some paragraphs are not in a logical sequence. It is obvious the author had very little actual material. The book is filled with background information that is only very loosely linked to Captain Egusa. Basically, this book is bad, bad, bad! If you are interested in dive-bomber pilots (including Captain Egusa)read "Into the Assault" by the same author.     
 I picked this book in my local libraby while browsing the shelves, so I had no expectations whatsoever and had not read any reviews. The author describes in great detail the normal behaviour of a baby from newborn to 3 years of age, and specifically what is undesirable. However, I didn't find almost any suggestions on how to deal with it! The other thing I really disliked is that he strongly urges the stay at home moms to find someone (teenager) to take care of the baby for couple of hours on regular basis.  
  After reviewing the novel, Teacher: The One Who Made A Difference by Mark Edmunson, I would give it two stars.  This book was about a boy and his high school memeories and how in the end a teacher made a difference on his future.  This book only relates to the teacher every so often, until the last chapter, where finally the author lets us the reader know how his future was affected by the teacher.  Throughout the book I felt like the reading was pointless and had no relation to the title.  I learned more about the football plays than I did about the author being affected by his teacher.  The good thing though, was some of the stories were interesting but at points they were hard to understand.  The author would be explaining one thing and then quickly switch over to another, making the book at some points have no organization.  Also the use of big words seemed sort of ridiculous just because the tone of the book was so casual.  The words were very out of place.  His use of analogies with philosophers and characters in the book was also something that kept my interest.  If it wasnt't for the few funny stories and the intersting analogies I feel I would have tossed this book away a long time ago.  
 This book is an utterly corrupt, crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them, to live under a constant cloud of suspicion, and to essentially ruin your personal relationships.  Shall I give you an example?  From page 122:  "You and a friend are deciding on what movie to see.  You suggest 'Lost In Paradise', but your friend, who doesn't want to see this, offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and didn't like it.  you then say 'Oh, well, if no one in your office liked it, I guess it's probably no good.'  If she lets it go at that - not correcting you - then you know she LIED INITIALLY" (emphasis mine).  Excuse me?  What kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know' your friend is a LIAR because she doesn't want to see a movie?  A little earlier, a technique called "Insert a False Fact" shows up.  INSERT A FALSE FACT?  Isn't that known as LYING?  And this in the context of a party, no less... hoo boy... start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars - you're gonna wind up friendless pretty quick.  If you just tell the truth, you'll be amazed at the nice people you meet - who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation?  Trust me, if you have a moral compass, you don't need this rag 
 Hopelessly misguided.  Overwhelmingly biographical.  Smartly directed.  Al Gore's never ending struggle to prove that mankind is destroying the earth and that the solution is international governmental control and primitive living reared its ugly head on the silver screen earlier this year and is now available on DVD!  Beware, though - that DVD is made of plastic, which is derived from a number of chemical compounds including - (gasp!) - oil.  The recipe for the movie, however, is 1 part science, 3 parts personal anecdotes, and 4 parts slideshow fun!  Mr. Gore has taken the liberty of inventing a scientific consensus (this is, of course after he invented the internet) on which to start his new campaign for president.  His movie is almost entirely about his own life.  A fair amount is devoted to his current struggle to advance the environmental movement, and what is left over is a small amount of very misleading science.  It isn't, necessarily, bad science - it is just far from representational.  However, I won't waste this review debating the scientific ideas advanced by Mr. Gore - there are plenty of other scientists and resources for that.  What needs to be recognized about this movie is that it is a campaign video and not an educational documentary.  There are components of informative dialogue and presentations, but this is really all about Al Gore, not global warming.  There is more discussion of how his political opponents have got in his way and in the way of his message than there is of actual solutions to the "problem."  This is my big criticism.  The movie masquerades as a documentary to advance an environmental cause when it really intends to advance Al Gore's availability for political office.  Even in that light it still operates dishonestly.  Mr. Gore chastises the Bush administration for refusing to take action to stop global warming.  However, even when Gore was running the country with Bill Clinton, they did nothing.  In fact, Gore's proclamation in the movie that he tried diligently to get Kyoto passed but was stopped by the Republicans is bogus.  The Clinton administration found the protocol unworkable and challenged the fact that it only bound a few nations to action without timetables.  They never even submitted it to the Senate for ratification.  In this fashion, the movie continues with one dishonest claim after another.  In the end, the movie is full of misleading science and statistics, complete lies and fabrications, and it focuses more on the nobility of Gore than on any perceived global issue.  The only thing that makes me give it a second star is the fact that it was smartly directed and well edited.  The message that the movie intended to convey comes across loud and clear and with style - it's just not a message that anyone should hear or trust 
 I was expecting a substitute for the classic "Photoshop Channel Chops" by Monroy and friends.  It trivializes the subject with "How to unlock the hidden power of channels ... blah blah. If you want a better understanding of channels be prepared to wade through a lot of fluff with this one.  Infomercial.      
      It's about a boy who started out in kindergarten. He found out that he would be in school a long time. He had a problem and through-up every were any given moment.       The only thing i liked about this book is that it had a somewhat ok plot. And it it's about a boy and his life.       The main thing i didn't like this book because it was pretty dull and boring. I fell asleep most of the time i started to read it. If you realy realy realy like books that you might think it's ok. It just was not like somthing in real life... but it was not a good fictional story also.      This book was not very interesting. It was pretty much like if you HAVE to read a book for i'd say ok. But if you wanna read it for fun... i wouldn't if i was you.  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 The author may be a good writer, but this book did not sell me on the idea of art therapy. I read it and still wondered, what is art therapy? I agree with the first reviewer who said it is a great reference listing. But I  enjoyed The Art Therapy Sourcebook more and would recommend that book if  you want to know more about art therapy. It gave me a better idea of what  art therapy is and how it is done 
 I like the show just fine, but you should probably double check the pricing on the individual season sets.  As it stands now, this is more expensive than just putting the 3 season sets in your cart separately 
 I loved Discipline of Market Leaders. As a business owner I read and listen to a lot of books and Discipline of Market leaders was great. Unfortunately this follow up book by only one of the authors didn't have much to offer. Lots and lots of words but not much being said. There are a few nuggets of knowledge, as there are with most books, but unlike the Discipline of Market leaders that I went through 3 times and even took notes while going through it, this new book was just short of a waste of time. Wish I could say it was better.. 
 I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD.  I should have paid more attention to the fact that there was another artist performing with the group before I ordered it.  I am sorry I bought it 
 This book has three elements.  A full third is a compilation of Foucault's writings and interviews on Iran.  It is a valuable addition to the Foucault literature.  Second, there is a historical recounting of Islamism as it pertains to the Iranian revolution.  I do not have the expertise to comment on this.  The third element, which frames the book, is an extended argument that in Foucault's reading of the Iranian revolution his own larger philosophical perspective is revealed.  This element, which I do have expertise in, is comically bad.    The authors claim that Foucault values traditional forms of life over modern ones, and thus embraces (like the radical Islamists) a return to the past.  In order to make their case, the authors resort to three strategies.  First, they neglect Foucault's own statements about his writings.  For instance, the authors insist that he saw ancient Greek sexual life as superior to ours, which Foucault explicitly denies.  Second, they engage in egregious misinterpretation.  For example, they read Foucault's book on the prisons as a plea for earlier forms of punishment.  The first few pages of the prison book, detailing the excruciating torture of an attempted regicide, should be enough to convince anyone of the paucity of that interpretation.  Finally, they misread Foucault's own sentences, in one case (p. 16) citing a long quote and then interpreting it as meaning something opposed to what it actually says.  Foucault insisted throughout his life that his work sought to deny the view that history naturally progresses from the worse to the better.  The authors seem to think that this means that his view of history was that it moved from the better to the worse.  It is harder to imagine a more fundamental mistake in the interpretation of Foucault's work.  All of this is unfortunate, particularly since Foucault, normally an astute observer of events, sorely misread the Iranian revolution.  This requires explanation.  The authors have provided the resources on which to base such an explanation.  However, given their inability to understand even the basics of Foucault's work, the explanation itself will have to await another book 
 This CD is defective.  We had two shipped to us and both would not play any music.  It was very frustrating dealing with returning and then receiving the new CD with the same problem again. We still do not know how good the music was because we never had the opportunity to listen to it 
 please! a nother bratz movie! this movie they look wireder then the rock angels. at least barbie has a nosies and real lips 
 I was never more disappointed in a book as I was with "dream boy" by Jim Grimsley. I guess I just didn't get it. The violence was not believable and there was a bigger issue that needed to be addressed. The first 109 pages were a good start to a coming of age novel but, then it was almost as if someone told him to hurry and finish so he could turn in his paper. I mean with chapters being one and two pages long? What's that about? The book turned from the real issue at hand when Roy, Nathan, Burke and Randy set off to go camping. The camping trip and violence was the last half (86 pages) of the book. It should have only been Roy and Nathan on the trip and Nathan should have been able to tell Roy the problem between him and his Father and Roy should have been aloud to help him get the issue resolved. Like the book "Uncle Sean", "Lance" and "All Over Him" by Ronald L. Donaghe or "Desert Sons" and "Into This World We're Thrown" by Mark Kendrick. These books are good coming of age books with love and violence which is most often the case with gay and straight youths trying to co-exist in the world filled with hatred for things not understood. - Joe - TX  
 This is a short review because when you've heard one of these you've heard them all.  They're all played in the same starched, stiff mannor, with brisk tempi, little feeling, no shaping of phrase, and no color.  The Mozart symphonies--the latter ones, anyway--have their own style and merit different approaches (No. 31, the "Paris," is almost curtain-raiser music for an opera buffa, for example, while No. 39 is in some ways proto-Beethoven, harmonically sharing a good deal with the "Eroica," and No. 40 shows Mozart heading into a realm of a basically Romantic chromaticism that would have led to much fascinating music if he'd lived longer and written more in that style).  Yet here all the works are played interchangably.  These are performances that could have been generated on a computer.  The sound is excellent, but that's about all there is to recommend this set.  Hogwood's traversal on period instruments has more personality, believe it or not.  And to really show what can be done with works like these on HIP instruments, try Franz Bruggen's remarkable recordings of the Haydn symphonies on Philips.  I can't recommend this set, and I got it for considerably less than the Amazon price, too.  
 This book is not about India or Indians.  Shallow characters.  Non existant plot.  A dismal end to a not terrible beginning.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I was unlucky enough to buy this book - what a waste 
    One reviewer wrote the review about the "Super Ants"....this is not that movie.    This movie staring Dean Cain bites big time, unless you like movies about chases....there are several car chases, car chasing man, man chasing man, helicopter chasing car....Get the point?    The plot is strained through out the movie in dribbles... if you can make it through the endless sceens showing actors walking around doing nothing,walking or staring blankly (probably wondering if this movie will ever be over). *** Fast forward special** 
 hard to Believe that Sidney Poitier went from Directing a Classic Comedy like "Stir Crazy" to this Music Video not ready for MTV type of Film.very 80's Campy&it was Corny then as it is now 
 Unfortunately, no one ever told Mr. Ressler that the presentation and analysis (sans the incessant patting himself on the back) of each case would have made his intelligence, experience and expertise self-evident.  It is heart-breaking that he felt the need to remind us on every other page how amazing he thinks he is.  Speaking only for myself; I'm sure I could have figured that out on my own!  I won't buy another of his books and I wouldn't recommend this one 
 Great camera for the price. But I guess you get what you pay for, bad warranty........... 
 Boeing is a very important American company that has gone from fantastic success to a serious downturn (fueled largely by complacency), and appears now in a major resurgence.  This is all good fodder for an important story.  Newhouse, however, squanders the opportunity to explain this journey in a useful manner that would help others - instead, "Boeing vs. Airbus" is largely a collection of seemingly infinite anecdotes and quotes without an integrating or convincing perspective.    For example, how bad were Boeing's assembly and design processes prior to the 777, in COMPARATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE TERMS?  Specifically, what was done to improve, and what steps were most important?  (Newhouse fails to even mention Boeing's data-processing problems - duplicated, costly, and non-communicative data-bases and systems.)  How important a contribution did CATIA software make to designing the 777?  Why did Boeing make such a seeming bad acquisition of McDonnell-Douglas - not only overpaying, but also ultimately putting those in charge while McDonnell-Douglas collapsed in charge of Boeing?  And on the other side, why has Airbus had so many problems with the A380's wiring - a topic not referenced at all by Newhouse?  Most, if not all, of Newhouse's material has been readily available in  business periodicals - in fact, "Boeing vs. Airbus" doesn't even capture all that was available.  Bottom-Line:  Read something else 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 I've been a David Benoit fan since the early 80s, and unfortunately, this latest recording comes nowhere close to the quality of his earlier efforts.  I get the feeling this was a contract fulfillment for GRP--I believe Benoit is now with Peak Records, where hopefully he'll regain some of freedom to record the adventurous and tasteful music he's recorded in the past.  This latest effort is almost as bland and faceless as most $mooth Jazz on the radio today--I can barely tell this is a David Benoit recording, he's so buried in the mix.  Rick Braun's heavy, slick "formula" over-production does not win any points here and, in my opinion, is a lot of the problem with this recording:  it panders to the $mooth Jazz crowd, not contemporary jazz fans (such as myself) who value melody and musicianship over fitting a radio-friendly formula.  I get the feeling I'm listening to a Rick Braun recording with Benoit as guest artist...and this is not a good thing!  For instance, this is the blandest cover of "Watermelon Man" I've ever heard.  I'm waiting for Benoit to give us another excellent album like "Letter To Evan", where he displays his considerable piano chops and yet, still gives us memorable melodies of his own, and his unique cover versions of others' tunes done in his inimitable contemporary style.  Skip this one unless you're a completist (like I am); if you're just starting out, get one of GRP's compilations, or pick up a few choice gems from his 80s and early 90s catalog.  
 right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing, half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks...don't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble 
 That which is original in this program is biased and untrue. That which is true is not original. This piece of environmental and liberal hyperventilation steals liberally from true scholarship, such as "Rats, Lice, and History" by Hans Zinsser. It makes obvious observations in such a self congratulatory style as to be nauseating. Diamond's on camera mugging and fake shows of emotion are hideous. National Geographic has sunk to new lows to screen this 
  As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about 
 OF NO USE TO ME .......A WASTE OF MONEY...LOVE THE QUILTS ... CAMPANIAN BOOK OF NO USE TO ME.....THANK YOU JOAN 
 It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash. 
 The Newsboys release another worship cd(yawn). While "Adoration" was an interesting and well done cd, "Devotion" continues that trend without adding anything new, exciting, or different. I guess if something works, you stick with it but this cd just kinda left me wishing for more. There are some gems on this cd but nothing can top the simplicity or impact that made "It is You" so powerful. Particularly forgettable is their version of "Blessed Be Your Name", which is a shame because they really do a great version of this in concert. This is a talented band who really can "Shine" when they want to. If you're a new fan, check out "Thrive" which I consider to be a true highlight of their remarkable career and fervent ministry. 
 Outdated, Utterly Inept...Bizarre chemical terminology from the 1800's. An entire chapter devoted to 'Papaver' sub-species with NO morphine alkaloid present...Global statistics on poppy cultivation from the 1950's...whatever-that's-for...etc etc etc. Garbage! 
 Evereyone has an opinion on a book, so I thought I would share mine. Yes, this book has a ton of information, maybe too much for the exam.   This edition is a far cry from the first one. The Lab configurations could drive you crazy. It was very hard to follow because 1 pod is 4 routers plus a frame switch and 2 Backbone routers! How many people have 7 routers????   The first edition called for 3 routers in a pod and 1 backbone router. This made preparing for configuration exercises easy.   Comparing the OSPF section from the 1st to the 2nd edition is totally different. All the information is the same but the 2nd edition makes for much harder reading.   I acutally returned the book. I was uncomfortable with the layout and organization of it. I am very disapointed with the way the authors changed it. They should have left it exactly as the 1st edition and updated it with new information. Instead they changed sections and made the Labs difficult.  I guess if you never owned the 1st edition, you would think this book is great 
  		Richard Pipes's Property and Freedom, offered by him as the work of a "dilettante", is professor emeritus of Russian and Soviet history at Harvard. He is the author of at least twelve other books, including A Concise History of the Russian Revolution (1995) and The Unknown Lenin (1996). His books are written in an agreeable prose, a passport across any boundary, but one. In conscience, Property and Freedom cannot be recommended except, perhaps, to someone who is dying of incurable boredom and needs a dose of it to go over the side, for rare is the person who can read this book without slumping over it, and wise is the person who does not read it in front of an open fire. As the great 19th century historian Jacob Burckhardt wrote, it is good for a specialist to be a dilettante in other fields, but he should be one "privately" (Burckhardt, Weltgeschichtliche Betrachtungen (Munich, 1978), 16). Pipes instead chose to write a book. 		Pipes wrote Poverty and Freedom to prove that liberty and the right to property are "connected", an idea that emerged in the seventeenth century and that no one contests. He claims, however, that though the idea is old, the historical evidence for this uncontested idea has not been gathered, and hence his book. It is doubtful that, after reading it, the reader will learn what he did not know at the beginning, and that is that rights have not "evolved" in a Darwinian garden, they are not sociobiological specimens, and they are not the result of theological epiphanies. They are powers that have been granted or seized because those who would deny them would suffer. All else - tracts, scrolls, philosophies, testaments, beliefs religious or pagan, all of the scenery and scripts that we call history, are as nothing compared with the central fact of power and its location. Magna Carta, for example, benefitted English barons, not Englishmen at large, and freedom of speech originated not in the mouth of an English divine or philosopher but in the grant of the English crown driven by the need of money to grant them to the House of Commons. 			For the history of the idea of property, Pipes recounts the thinking of Western philosophers, theologians, and political theorists. We are treated to the differing views of Plato and Aristotle, the influence of Stoicism on Christianity, the immense contribution of Roman jurists, the radical opinions of St Thomas Aquinas, the inspiriting of capitalism by Calvin, the derisable ideas of the "noble savage" and "Utopia", and on and on through the Law of Nature, Grotius, Hobbes, Harrington, Locke, Rousseau, and the calling in, of all people, Wordsworth and Coleridge, all of this and one has reached only page 49, with last-page 328 a rumored oasis in the distance, reachable after one has run barefoot over 907 footnotes in which one's closing eyes may find six languages to feast upon. If this book has one constant flaw, it is its daunting incantation of facts and opinions that fly by like freight trains, all to prove that the right to property is essential to liberty. The flaw may be forgivable on the ground that Pipes, a Polish Jew who fled Poland in 1940 at the age of ten, has for decades lived intellectually with the murderous sweep of Marxist Communism, fixed at 20,000,000 under Stalin, and 120,000,000 throughout the earth (See, Stephane Courtois et al., Le livre noir du communisme (Paris: Laffont, 1997)).  		For property as an institution, Pipes examines history, psychology, anthropology, and sociobiology, to prove to us, a people consecrated to materialism, that acquisitiveness is universal among humans as well as animals. He covers possessiveness in animals, including insects, from protozoa to primates, careful to include dragonflies and the beloved three-spined stickleback. At one point he writes, "Such examples can be multiplied ad infinitum", causing this reviewer to reflexively drop his book. Nor does the acquisitive behavior of children escape Pipes's cascade of what must be thousands of 4 by 6 index cards. Following children, presumably in logical progression, are "possession among primitive peoples" and "societies of hunters and gatherers". The myth of a primitive communism is bound and taken to the scaffold, while private property in antiquity, feudal and mediaeval times, is reported, together with the creation of the state as the guarantor of ownership. 		Pipe points to England as the classic illustration of how private wealth came to restrain public authority. Parliament, the servant of the crown from the 11th to the 15th century, then its partner from the 16th to the early 17th century, became the crown's master in the 1640's. The secret, described by Pipe in  habitual detail, was simple. The crown needed money. The "people" had it or controlled it and demanded freedoms and reforms for it. He traces English history from pre-Norman times through the development of the common law, the crucial history of English taxation, the history of the Tudors, Stuarts, the Commonwealth, and the Revolution of 1688.     		By way of comparison to England's history, the story of patrimonial Russia, including two and a half centuries of serfdom and seventy years of Communist rule during the latter of which Russians were deprived of liberties to a degree hitherto unknown on earth, is painstakingly set forth in proof of how the absence of the right of property makes tyrannical government possible. Like its predecessors, this chapter sorely needed surgery. It is overloaded with historical material that satisfies only a narrow scholarly interest. Still, there are matters that might engage the reader, particularly Pipes's development of the idea that Russians historically saw sovereign power as the source out of which property issued, and the fact that Russian liberals under the Tsar saw law as the cornerstone of liberty but did not see the connection between law and private property. 		In Pipes's last chapter, he tours our welfare capitalist state, complaining that entitlements create dependence, environmental laws are oppressive, minimum wage laws interfere with freedom of contract, banks are pressured into minority loans, rent control is bad economics, administrative agencies are governmental islands broken away from the continental shelf, taxation of personal income unjustly redistributes wealth, affirmative action in employment is the most egregious form of governmental interference, the government takes property by regulating its use, and so on, providing a communal table at which readers of this review  at this moment are selecting their favorite complaints. 	 Pipes's book invites criticism, but there is in this his last chapter a sudden, disarming admission.  A way, he writes, must be found to preserve property as a fundamental human right while, at the same time, "ensuring fundamental social justice". Had Pipes but written a slim, creative volume on social justice in a capitalist state, he might have given us something worth fifty books on the connection between property and freedom. The way to preserve the right to property and to assure social justice, he argues, is mainly "by attitudes which determine how laws and institutions are employed." This reviewer would put it another way. On the one hand, welfare capitalism offers the best opportunity for realizing freedom and achieving productivity while assuring minimum benefits to those least fortunate. On the other hand, working and middle class majorities may demand too much equality with the rich, thus impairing the prospect of long term economic productivity and giving too little equality to the underprivileged to satisfy their right to human development. Thus, the justice of welfare capitalism depends on the virtue of moderation by all classes for the sake of the common good. Imperfect as the analogy may be, it is somewhat like one ship towing another at sea. The knack is to keep both ships "in step" by using a tow line of such a length that the ships meet the waves and ride over them together, otherwise one vessel might be in a trough while the other is on a crest, causing the line to slacken and then tauten with sudden violence, doing neither much good. So too in welfare capitalism. The expectations of the classes must be such that one does not destroy the other, otherwise they will all go down. 			   
 This cake mix was like water & when I baked it - it was like a cake of paste!!Itdid not bake well at all- flat & raw . 
 This book demonstrates the sloppy scholarship of a high-school dropout. His theology was discarded by his organization as soon as the megalomaniac died.  He was as wrong about history as he was about theology.  It has also been disclosed that he copied much of this book from another author's earlier publication.  This man has been discredited as a theologian long ago 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
   The questions in the theoretical exams do not reflect what you will find on the actual test. If you use this book alone to prepare, there is a good chance you will fail the exam. In general, the questions will help you to grasp some fundamentals, but you will need to go over some more realistic test questions to prepare 
 I used to be a VCA fan. I even stuck with the books after Neiderman started writing them, and helped run the biggest (at the time) internet fan club for her. I grew out of her books somewhere after the Melody series, and since then haven't read her books that often. However, this book caught my eye. "Dares to break all the rules"! That's what the cover said! So I picked it up, and hey- April is short, sensitive, and overweight. Well, that does indeed sound different, I think to myself. How nice it'll be to read a book with a chubby protagonist, I wondered how the issue of her size would be dealt with.   Well, let me say this: poorly. Very, very poorly. Throughout the entire book April does not once ever think anything nice about herself or her body. She's criticized constantly for her size, and she refuses to stand up for herself. It's not at all an exaggeration to say that at least once every five pages there is some mention of her being "overweight", "obese", "20 pounds too much" or some other phrase that points a negative view on herself. There's huge focus on her dieting and on her sister and father being angry with her for doing things like - oh my god - eating a meal! To say that I was disappointed in this book is an understatement. In a world where there are so many young girls with eating disorders and self esteem and self image issues, this book only goes to further perpetuate it all. It's funny, because I always laughed at the typical moaning of VCA's characters over their "bony collarbones", but at least those characters appreciated their bodies for what they were, in spite of their flaws.   There are other issues in this book - yes, there's a homosexual theme. Yes, it's predictable. There are so many stereotypes floating around in this book that it's ridiculous. Brenda, the jock lesbian. Peter, the Native American whose sole purpose in the story is to tell April about native lore and to "follow the wheel." Of course, there's the chubby April, who's fat because she's lazy and eats too much.   I would say that the one and ONLY positive part of this book is in the way that it deals with Brenda and Celia's relationship - very straightforward and without a lot of explaining. Their relationship just is what it is, and there's not a lot of controversy around it. (You may insert your own controversy if you wish..

 Unlike so many tutorial or reference books on the subject of Illustrator, this book only skims the surface of the key functions of Illustrator.  Things to be aware of: There are no companion CD tutorials - you're on your own.  This book does not give you detailed information on how to do anything. A few step-by-step examples are given on some certain methods, but mostly not. The few examples of "How to" are very high level and do not go into any detail. This book will not serve as a good reference book - information is to high level and does not include details. You will have to create your own graphics just to follow along the lessons so you can understand the concept.  On the plus side: The book now has color illustrations. The tips on the bottom of each "How To" lesson are very useful. If you have a general knowledge of Illustrator, this book can be used without the software or a PC as casual reading.  The book is broken down in seven parts: Part 1 - Prepare Your Illustrator Project Part 2 - Draw Objects Part 3 - Add Type Part 4 - Work with Drawings Part 5 - Manage Fills Part 6 - Use Layers and Styles Part 7 - From Illustrator to Print and Web  This book borders on being useless for people who are seriious about learning Illustrator. Better books that will help the novice illustrator: Illustrator CS Hands-On Training by [...] books  The Adobe Illustrator manual/book that comes with the software

 Suzanne Somers' diet is a good idea and it works. However, based on her earlier successes, Ms. Somers' has started marketing a series of products to help follow her diet. This book is filled with recipes that all require her new products. Buy her old book where she still focused on using what is in your kitchen. These recipes are merely marketing for her products 
 The most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it?   After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day?  Mystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it 
 Perfect as a gift for those whose coffee table is Hollywood challenged.  Apparently, the author/editors believe Los Angeles is 9 parts Hollywood, 1 part unimportant.  Also, this book is for the advanced Hollywood student who already knows where most of these vital cultural icons exists - addresses are infrequently provided - or doesn't really care.  Original camera positions for the "then" pictures are not duplicated in the modern version, and worse, the year in which the historic photograph is taken is not uniformly provided.  Film star names are essential to the sparse narrative, as opposed to information as to the significance or relevance to Los Angeles/rest of planet of the site/photo chosen 
 I found the book on my gf's shelf, and thought it would be fun read.  Typically I read the book cover to cover including the Preface etc, which is where I found the warning that this book was NOT a how-to guide. So while I knew what I was getting myself into, I proceeded.  At sub 200 pages, this book is filled with fluff, in a typical journalistic fashion the author is bent on telling us what the characters were "eating" while they were going through the motions.  I feel this book would have been a pamphlet if it wasn't for the unnecessary background information about each case of espionage.  I wouldn't recommend this book, through I think if you find your local news channel "entertaining" - you may like it.  I found NO take-a-way's from this book. So sad, with a catchy title and cool cover graphics, it could have been a contender. . .  
 The transistor is essential to modern life in America. Without its development I would not have been able to leave this review today. This is a look at how it developed and how it led to the start of the modern computer.  My one complaint about this book is that it becomes far too bogged down in scientific jargon and lost the social history as it did so. The business discussion is mediocre at best especially given the delicate relations that occurred to fight over this chip.  A much needed book but executed poorly.  
 They say Brian De Palma's `Femme Fatale' has a very tricky plot. It is true that the plot has a big twist, but I am not allowed to reveal it, so let me only say this. Whether or not you like the film depends on the incredibly convoluted story. I thought it is overcooked, way too much for me to take. But you might feel differently. Well, but who can tell?   All I can say with confidence is that `Femme Fatale' is a noir, or dark crime thriller that features a beautiful but dangerous woman Laure (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). At the 2001 Cannes Film Festival (and the scenes were shot during the real premier showing of `East-West') Laure and other robbers try to pull off a heist.   After outwitting other gangsters, Laure becomes another person named Lily. But how? You might not believe me, but she was so lucky that she could find an exact look-alike of her, and no one suspects the truth! Well, seven years later Laure is still doing this masquerading game successfully until one cameraman Nicholas (Antonio Baderas) takes a photo of her face, which makes the cover of a magazine. Now intrigues, blackmails, shootings, etc. ensue.  As the film's title suggests, `Femme Fatale' has references to crime thrillers like `Double Indemnity' Some might remember Hitchcock's `Vertigo' for the very obvious reason. Watching someone through a camera is a familiar theme to this genre (`Rear Window') and Brian De Palma himself has used it several times in his career. There are interesting details - Laure's hair, repeated images and hidden meaning of water and clock, for instance - and there is even split screen, signature technique of De Palma. Like his previous films (no, I'm not talking about `Mission to Mars' or `Mission Impossible'), `Femme Fatale' needs repeated viewings.   But for the following two reasons, I don't think many would watch it more than once. One is the weakness of the acting of the leading lady Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. I hear the contrary opinion about her, and I confess that my judgment about acting is totally subjective, but it is clear, I think, that she is no Barbara Stanwyck. I am not saying that Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is not sexy - she is - but not good and seductive enough to call her femme fatale who can seduce a man and a woman alike (yes, look at the opening sequence, where some might have guilty pleasure like me).  And the other reason is THE twist that comes later in the film. Please see for yourself. For all the smooth camerawork of De Palma, and the beautiful photography of Thierry Arbogast (`The Fifth Element') and score of Ryuichi Sakamoto (`The Last Emperor') I felt I was cheated in the end. I never thought it is coming. But is it my fault that I didn't expect it?   `Femme Fatale' has stylish images and good soundtrack, but the script is too smart for its own good 
 I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...  Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.  Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?  Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.  (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art. 
 I bought this to simplify making fries, it was a disappointment. It takes a lot of effort to push through a potato, and when it does go through it most likely won't go straight. Either save your money and use a knife, or spend more and get a mandoline 
 Loser by Jerry Spinelli could have been an interesting and overall good book but, in my opinion it was not because it was rushed and undeveloped.  The book chronicles the life of Donald Zinkoff from his first day of kindergarten to his last day of eighth grade in a mere two hundred pages.  Thus no grade is well developed and neither is any character but the loveable loser and main character Donald Zinkoff.  This book was attempting to give a good message about the life through school of a loser.  Because it is hard to go through your time in school with out true friends or any real interests to speak of let alone to be unatheletic on top of it.  But although the message was no doubt an outstanding one, it left much to be desired as a whole 
 George Soros, one of the greatest speculators of all time wrote this book which is an ode to govenment and bureaucracy intervention. It seems at first sight that Soros realized that true liberalism (not the liberalism of the left wing in America) was wrong and thus the Estate should intervene to fix the market's problems.  Now you may be asking, How come a guy who made 1 billion dollars in one day thru speculation against the british pound in the 90's is now a critic of the system that let him speculate and get rich?. Well, Soros changed his mind about capitalism when he lost 2 billion dollars during the russian crisis. He tried to convince the World Bank and the IMF to save russian markets like they did in Mexico in 1995, but no help was approved.  So, what's the solution according to Soros? Easy: create new bureaucracy. He wants a Global Fed, Government intervention in the markets and a more robust and strong Estate. If this solution were to be implemented, Soros would be denying to others the opportunities he had to get rich. I think what Soros wants is to prevent others to compete with him perhaps because he is tired of today's competition.  If you are into Mises, Hayek or even Friedman, this book will only be useful to show the clichs that the left wing repeats over and over against capitalism. It doesn't add something new to the debate, just shows us that Soros is a great speculator but a poor economist 
 Caputo has written much on Derrida's approach to religion and if your familiar with this attitude also associated with Levinas, usually dubbed as post-secularism, then you know what to expect.  I enjoyed some of the insights within this book, but Zizek's On Belief from the same series surpasses this work on many accounts.  Pass this one up in favor his.  It's much more relevant and intellectually challenging 
  I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks. 
 This book has a promising start.  Rick Summers, the protagonist of this effort from Frank, has just finished visiting the cemetery to mourn his mom and sister.  He gets into a cab, and immediately finds that his driver has been replaced by a corpse.  A good start, but it's soon downhill from there.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I will talk about what hurts this book.  Most noticably, the dialogue throughout is stilted and mind-numbing.  The characters don't seem capable of any discussion that doesn't focus on flirting, and their deepest statements sound like something a 7th-grader might come up with.  Even their thoughts are boring, especially those of Rick, who seems to spend most of his time thinking about how much he'd like to get every female character in this novel into the sack.  When he's not concentrating on bedding each woman, or thinking about lesbian action, he turns his mind to other important pursuits like drinking.  At points, the book seems like some young man's fantasy life - getting drunk and having sex with hot women.  As for the story, there are a couple of problems.  The first is that much of it is nonsensible.  There are some great ideas, but the author doesn't manage to tie them well together.  Added to that is the pacing, which is erratic.  Too much time is spent on certain parts, which makes it plodding, while interesting scenes are really glossed over.  Again, there are the makings of an interesting story, but they're lost in the clutter.    This one may have been saved had the hero been someone with whom we could sympathize, but he's not.  Really, I couldn't have cared less by book's end about his fate.  This isn't the worst book I've read, but it's not something I would recommend.  
 This is quite possibly the worst piece of scholarship that I have read in this field. The central conceit of the book involves an error of self-persuasion: namely, that the author's own vicissitudes over racial issues in the post-60s decades are historically reflected in some empirical fashion in the history of Jewish people in American society. The insights that the author has lifted from other books are of the cut-and-paste variety rather than a serious rethinking and analysis 
 Gets a star for pointing out that writing is scary, but has nothing to offer in terms of advice beyond "do it anyway, risk-taking is good."  So now we need a writer oriented book on risk-taking, I guess 
 This was a real let down for my daughter.  She loves horses and has several Breyer horses.  When we saw this paddock she was so excited about it.  We decided to get it for her for Christmas.  It is very flimsy, does not stay together and breaks easily.  She spent more time trying to fix it than actually playing with it.  After a couple of weeks it was just completely not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away, only the doll and horses were salvagable 
 Avoid at all costs. See my IMDb review for more. And I don't give a dang if you say no. It's a movie you must turn off your brain to enjoy. My brain? It can't be shut off 
 It's wonderful, in a way, when a person writes a book whose predictions turn out to be completely wrong.  (Less wonderful when people keep buying his nonsense!)  A review of this book can be very brief -- just two points need be made:  1. There wasn't a great depression in the 1990s (to the posters who say there was a "recession" in the early 90s, I say: the unemployment rate in the US during the real Great Depression was 25% at its peak.  It never cracked 6.5% in the 1990s.  A mild recession does not a depression make, nor does it justify the title or apocalyptic tone of this book.)  2. Had the US adopted Batra's recommended policies -- dramatic increases in trade restrictions, etc. -- there WOULD have been a depression.  One of the central causes of the real Great Depression was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which increased tariffs dramatically.  Batra proposed similar measures in this book.  In other words, in order to prevent a depression that never came, Batra argued that we ought to adopt measures that caused an actual depression in the past 
 At first this book touched me deeply and got me hoping, but it became quickly clear that the author, with his mediocre storytelling ability, narrow Catholic perspective, and lack of emotional penetration, couldn't handle the intensity of his main character.  Although I was pulled in by the wild Mr. Blue, whose positivity, courage, simplicity, and rejection of all things conventional are quite above the average, he failed to develop as a character and instead grew dissociated and saccharine - like Jesus with all of the peace and none of the sword.    Our world doesn't need another self-sacrificing martyr who has no deep point of view beyond finding joyous pleasure in starving himself to death amid the world's most broken souls.  Anyone who thinks that's what Jesus is about is missing the depth of his spiritual message.  My personal opinion is that the real Jesus would label Mr. Blue mentally ill.  But that said, I still commend Myles Connelly for at least attempting to share his deeper point of view.  Few people nowadays are willing to step out of the herd enough to take that risk 
 I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I read, "For Better or Worse", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. It kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because I didnt' have anything else to do. I am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.    I totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. There were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. To me, Matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. I think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage.   If you want to read something good, pick up a Jane Green novel instead.  
 Mr Stross' book is very difficult to read by anyone with knowledge of the industry or of Microsoft's products and its business products. Stross manages to skip over many key aspects of Microsoft's rise and its predatory  business practices. This includes the omission of Microsoft's deal to  supply the official OS for the IBM PC, which provided it with annual  profits that were greater than the gross revenues of its competitors.  This  revenue stream enabled it to repeatedly produce inferior products  (spreadsheet, word processing, and OS GUI) for a period of many years, a  failure that would have resulted in their closing their doors but for the  offsetting profits from their crude DOS operating system.  Any refinements  to their products were only offered to consumers in response to  competitors' superior offerings.   Stross even goes so far as to state that  Microsoft's practice of charging a license fee for every CPU shipped by  computer manufacturers, regardless of whether the user wanted DOS or  Microsoft's Windows GUI, benefited the consumer who got a price break (due  to volume license discounts) on the operating system they did not want in  the first place. If anyone wants to really understand the emergence of  Microsoft and the personal computer industry they would do well to look  elsewhere 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 This book has generated so much hype, and yet I fail to see how a Christian cannot be other than offended at the way Tenney treats the Bible. I picked this up to read, as it was recommended to me by a number of people, and I put it down again after the first chapter. He talks about the Bible as God's 'old love letters to the church' and defines a God-chaser as someone who is not content 'to camp out on some dusty old truth known to everyone'. I have listened to him preach at a conference and the same derogatory approach to the Bible and its doctrine was evident. So Scripture is not enough? Historic doctrine is inferior to Tenney's direct revelations? The teaching of Scripture is just dusty old truth, not the living word but 'old love letters'? Sorry, but this is nothing but plain mysticism. Tommy Tenney might think he has privileged access to new revelations and experiences of God above and beyond Scripture, but I don't accept it and have no intention of reading a book that so denigrates Scripture. Looks to me like nothing other than a revival of gnosticism 
 I finally read this book, after feeling as if I were missing out on a cultural reference point.  If you feel the same way, then go ahead and read it.  However, if you're looking for something more, I believe you'll be disappointed.  It's a trip inside the mind of a drug addict and although parts are funny, it's hard to overlook the despair coming from the pages 
 I had to say that I, too, thought this was the worst book I have ever read--hands down.  I have a master's degree in comparitive literature, and other than Moll Flanders and Fanny Hill, I have never read a...what did the other reviewer call them "bodice-rippers"?--so it's not a case of lack of taste.  The author of this book is self-indulgent, pompous, "in the know, and I'm never going to let you forget it!"--the whole thing is like listening to a half muttered conversation that after time you realize that you are never going to be let into.  I did plow through to the end, but only as a test of my endurance.  And I cheered at the end--but only because the damned thing was done 
 Okay, this book was so absolutely basic that I could have written it.  I was extremely disappointed with how much I didn't learn from this book.  It is 45 pages long, so if you're expecting a good, interesting weekend read--this is not it.  There weren't any detailed case studies.  There weren't any crime scene pictures.  Just basic info on fingerprinting and skull re-construction and a little bit of this-and-that.  Extremely basic.  Recommended for the interested 11 year old, but not for anyone who wants to really learn the nitty-gritty of Forensic Anthropology 
 The title of the book was a bit misleading. The Playboy Mansion was only mentioned in about 10% of the book, and it was not the part of the book where everyone was having most of the wild parties. It was the part where she sought refuge from the crummy life she was living with her father, who was Hugh Hefner's doctor.  Her father was a mess.   The rest of the book was repetitious- how many times can you tell about parties which all sound the same-- sex, drugs, more sex, etc.  Actually, since she was so young, the whole book was pathetic and pitiful.  What a life for a teenager.  This book is very sad. 
 Very basic information at best. Not really much help if you are seriously thinking of growing your own grapes. Many questions, like what variety should I grow, in not addressed properly as far as a Merlot or Cabernet etc. In fact the word "Merlot" is not even in the book! How far apart should the vines be planted? Beats me! I guess I'll have to look in another book. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 As a Will Ferrell fan I will go easy.  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Had I seen this in the theaters I would have demanded my money back. 
 For me the only thing this book has going for it is a good title.  I, too, was annoyed with Rebecca telling the story backwards but that wasn't enough for me to dislike the book.  In this Picoult debut, one thing is glaringly clear and it's that the author doesn't write men very well.  All the sections supposedly in the men's point of view--sounds like a woman.  Their thoughts their reasonings sounded feminine--like what a woman thought a man thought like--if that makes any sense.  And quite frankly I didn't care for Joley.  His love for his sister borders incestuous (he wants to be cremated and wore as a necklace so he can be close to her heart?), and his character is never consistent.  For the first half the book he's practically rooting for Jane to leave her husband at any cost and then he doesn't an abrupt about face with no real reason behind it.  Plus, there are sections when I question his mental health.  Was he borderline retarded? Plus, why was he so stunned that she may have slept with his boss?  In his point of view section, he gave her to the man.  He wasn't thinking about his niece then.  I don't have a problem with fifteen-year old Rebecca falls for a twenty year old man, that's normal to have crushes at that age.  But then to have the man fall for her and then consumate the relationship is more than I can stand.  It's called statutory rape.  And yes I understand that Jane fell for her husband at that age, BUT Jane and Oliver waited until she was older before consumating the relationship. The author tries to go through great pains to convince us that Rebecca is not the average fifteen year old--she mature and yada yada.  Since when?  Lord knows her mother will let her talk to any man, encourage her to roll down windows to talk to strangers, let strangers gawk at her.  Then the girl hitchhikes with truckers she knows who want to rape her.  I mean, come on. Jane, on top of being a horrible mother, garnered no sympathy points with me.  Her behavior in front her impressionable child is horrendous.  She teaches her child how steal food from a diner, how to steal money from a car dealer (a bad one), and then have an affair with a man she just met in a bedroom next door to the child.  Whatever.  Then instead of being the parent and putting an end of the relationship or haul Rebecca fast-butt out of there, she meekly goes to Sam and gives him the ultimatium to handle it.  WHAT??  Jane doesn't want a child, she wants a best friend.  Then she susposed to be some sacrifical lamb when she returns home with her husband.  Jane needs therapy--plain and simple. Oliver catches her in bed with another man and literally seconds later he's kissing her.  On what plantet?  I can't tell you how many eye rolls I did for the letters across the nation Joley did.  How do you write a letter to the post office addressed to someone who doesn't live or work there?  This isn't the 1800s.   Bottom line: Oliver and Jane are both abusers who deserve each other.  Nuff said 
 I love most of Mary McCarthy, but in my opinion, this is her weakest book.  It covers basically the same territory as Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, which she wrote in the 1950s.  Here, however, there's little trace of her signature, tightly-wrought style.  Instead, the style is baggy, with convoluted sentences, chatty asides, digressions within digressions, and endless lists of books she read, names of friends, etc.  As a result, I often lost track of the basic story - which, after all, was the exact same story she had already told in Memories of a Catholic Girlhood.  I'm rather confused as to why McCarthy wrote this book at all.  Given that she had already written a detailed memoir of her formative years, why not just skip ahead to the mid-1930s, the subject of her unfinished "Intellectual Memoirs" 
 Ok this is another one of Anna's pointless films. It sucked. I think instead of renting this video send your $2 to anna so she can pay for some acting classes 
 It's tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how BAD it truly is, but Ms. Grafton has somehow earned a following, and as I've said before, there is something for everyone out there. After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.  Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: "...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began."  I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter 
 The present-day Pentagon budget, adjusted for inflation, is projected to be 23% over the average of the Cold War era.  By some calculations, the U.s. spends more than all other nations on defense, maintaining forces in several dozen countries (perhaps over 100).  Among current members of Congress, the percent of veterans is now lower than anytime since the end of WWII.  Bacevich goes on to assert that we have married a militaristic mindset in the 1990s with utopian ends, that this has been reaffirmed by 9/11 and the Global War on Terror, and that this does not serve our interests.  Probably true.  However, the vast bulk of "The New American Militarism" consists of Bacevich rambling about Weinberger, Powell, Abrams, etc., with little compelling documentation, quantification of impact, or common thread.  Bottom Line:  Boring 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 Given that this is the man who claimed to have predicted the fall of the Soviet Union years before it occurred, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately after having read this dirge, I'm suspicious that Todd would be incapable of predicting what day tomorrow is.   The book starts with a self promoting preface, wherein Todd tries to play up some vague Pro American sympathies he professes to have, which given the later content is somewhat reminiscent of Robert Mugabe's early eulogising of white farmers in Zimbabwe.  Todd's book has two main premises, one, that the US is a spent power, using it's military to intimidate other nations into providing it the capital and goods that it needs to continue it's parasitic existence. The other that Europe (A united superpower version of the EU, which doesn't actually exist), Russia and Japan should realise they are the masters of the earth, not the US. (He seems to periodically forget China exists).   To support this disturbed worldview, he proceeds to give bizarre, specious arguments using faulty logic. (The US is equally to blame for the Russian situation in Chechnya was one eyebrow raising example - although in this case, it was probably driven by his desire to portray Russia as a positive force compared to the wicked US).  His main arguments are basically vague attempts at portraying a world he would like to see (Europe, specifically France, as a global colossus, bolstered by the Economic and military might of Russia and Japan). He brushes over such things as the demographic meltdown of Germany, presenting it as a positive force since it means that Germany will eventually shrink to about the same size population as France, at which point the Franco - German axis will be a partnership of equals!   The peculiar self-deluding bigotry that permeates the French so called elite. is present in spades in this book, and unfortunately just comes across , as a wish list from a man who  hasn't realised that his countries imperial days ended in 1945.   A huge disappointment, I had hoped for an insightful analysis of the real problems that afflict the US, not a bigoted attack shrouded in pseudo intellect and drowned in meaningless statistics.    
 I didn't really like this book.  Especially the 2nd half when I felt it went downhill. [...]  It's pretty outrageous actually, some of the preparations for said war that are recommended.  I don't want to dismiss them entirely, bc who knows, maybe it will happen.  I still felt silly reading it, and I doubt any normal people would take the suggestions seriously.  Such as stockpiling this and that, getting guns, and moving to obscure parts of the country--come on now.  Seemingly everything short of building your own bunker.  Or maybe even that was mentioned; I'm not totally sure because there were large parts of the book where I took to skimming when I felt the content was not very valuable.  The first half was fairly fresh, but later I began to realize that a lot of information and even phrases were being repeated.  Tons of griping about Jews, again in quite a repetitive fashion I thought.  Now I don't disagree with the subject matter, but I've read books on the subject that I appreciated more.  Look around for them first, I don't feel like mentioning specifics though.  Actually, aside from WW3 mentioned above, "Culture of Critique" for one.  It's more dense and academic, but I preferred it to what I felt was the overly conversational, casual tone in this book.  The author writes from a lawyer's perspective, but other than that I don't see anything new this book brings to the table compared to others.  *Almost forgot, there's a huge section on financial advice too, particularly regarding the hoarding of gold and other outlandish tips.  Author talks about all sorts of economics and finance, and I just don't think this is within the scope of his qualifications.  It's never too cool when authors begin to bite more than they can chew.  I understand why this book would be rated highly--it's one of a number in this genre that tend to receive zealous support no matter what their merit.  Most I've found surprisingly good and even deserving.  However, as a literary work and in terms of informative/analytical value and unique content, I think this falls short.  In summary, I would say to at least place this one on queue after other similar titles, if not avoiding it altogether.  Especially considering it won't be available in libraries and you will probably have to purchase it, and resell it if you're like me.  **Pardon me, I meant "Civil War 2" not WW 
 I'm not qualified to disagree with the glowing reviews of the acting, etc., but I was annoyed by the way the flashbacks were done.  I suppose it was a metaphor for what Iris must have been going through.  But LOTS of people are slutty or succumb to Alzheimer's.  What made Iris noteworthy was her writing.  To focus on the former and almost entirely omit the latter is shamelessly manipulative, and it made my girlfriend, who lost a grandparent to Alzheimer's, cry.  I suppose the moral of the story is:  Don't watch movies; read books instead 
 This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment 
 Sir, not only have I knowledge of Scotland, I am Scottish, have lived there for 4 decades and I have a great deal of insight into the machinations of societies within the conurbations that create the cities of Scotland. These are not kernals of truth in my review - but factually accurate statements reflecting a book. Go check the pages yourself and you will see that no where have I made this up! I challenge to tell us all, have you even BEEN to Scotland yourself? If indeed you knew Scotsmen, you would have a full and complete undertanding of my review!! Apparantly you do not!! And therefore you are in no position to discuss the factual relevence of my review 
 I found the book very disappointing. I have donkeys and given the books title assumed equal time would be given to donkeys and mules. Instead only one of 31 chapters dealt with donkeys and as the author pointed out there are major differences between the two. Since I don't have mules, I can't comment on those chapters. I did enjoy the pictures 
 I found this work quite disappointing, full of vague, overgeneralized ideas so much a part of new age literature 
 Nice try but no cigar.  Lots more books nail it quicker and better 
 And that's pretty much all this book does. And truly I'd be okay with that if it were at all well written or offered ANY real insight into his method. Y'know how reality shows always spend like one-third of their air time repeating stuff they already told you? This book is like that.   The King of Virgin is clearly a marketing genius. Surely there's another book that does him justice 
  While I admit to occasionally using the phrase "in the trenches" to describe software development, I generally consider military analogies to be inappropriate descriptors of how software is created. A military organization is composed of a rigid command hierarchy where orders are not to be questioned. No software development shop could ever be run in this manner. Military subordinates can be screamed at, ridiculed and within general guidelines that are sometimes exceeded, abused. Once again, that strategy does not work in the business world.  The worst military analogy offense in the book is chapter ten, "Psychological Warfare." While keeping a team functional using psychological techniques is a well-known tactic, the means of psychological warfare are completely different. The authors admit this when in the chapter they utter the sentence; "Mastery of these techniques should provide tools for effective persuasion in both group situations and face-to-face interactions." There are many problems in that sentence. An argument that techniques used to psychologically weaken an enemy in warfare will prove effective in working with team members in a business setting is absurd. Also, there is the key word "should", a weak word indicating that the authors are not convinced that these tactics will work.   This absurdity also appears on the back cover in the form of the blurb, "With hands-on exercises, real-life war stories and a take-no-prisoners attitude, `Software Architect Bootcamp, Second Edition', won't just help . . . " I have no idea how the authors of this book conduct their businesses, but in the development teams I have worked with, that kind of tactic destroys the consensus necessary for people to work together effectively. In fact, I have no idea what a "take-no-prisoners attitude" is supposed to mean in a software development environment.   While I found the military wording to be an unnecessary distraction, there is some good advice in the book. Using architecture in the same sentence as software is a relatively new phenomenon. Recently, the complexity of applications has grown to the point where developers have split into different areas. There are still people who write the code, but now there are others whose fulltime job is to develop and manage the overall structure of the application. These people, commonly called software architects, need to be trained in ways completely different from the code writers. While they need to learn how to put software components together, they also need to be trained in how to articulate their vision and convince people by rational argument. The authors cover the different aspects of software architecture and end each chapter with a set of essay questions that are partially answered.   I really have ambivalent feelings about this book; it does contain a great deal of useful information regarding software architecture. However, the absurd analogies weaken it when compared to others, so that is why I only give it two stars. I would not use it to train software architects 
 Hundreds of writers have waded into the Arthurian waters and some have come away with great books. This isn't one of those times. The Guinivere in Dragon Queen is so perfect she's just a card board figure. The ruin of Merlin's character isn't even worth talking about. I bought it at 8:15 AM read it, didn't like and by 4 PM I got my money back 
 It is a pretty common thing nowadays for Russians to try and sell their "secrets" to the west now that the cold war is over. It is particularly interesting to learn what their "secret services" might have done, since they used to be our enemies and our government worked awfully hard to make them look evil. More than a few Russians are making bank by fabricating material to sell to an eager yet naive western population.  That is precisely what this book is. There is over a hundred photos of the author in this book, but he does not look physically fit. He looks like a former gulag prisoner. There are lots of quotes from famous communists in the book, but most of them are false and completely misplaced. They are false attempts to make readers think the author is the real deal.  Here is where he fails: First, nobody in their right mind wants to look like a gulag prisoner. The purpose in physical training is to look GOOD, to look fit. The author doesn't look good at all, except for his abdominal muscles. No, he looks like an Auschwitz (or Sukhanovka, the Soviet equivalent) survivor. And the author's description of the Soviet system of training is completely wrong. Nobody is going to be able to convince me that the secret of Soviet training was LIMITED reps, LIMITED sets, MAXIMUM rest between sets. That is what the author is trying to sell here, and it is sheer garbage. The Soviet system was built on the ability to survive incredible hardship. Their athletes did well because they were incredibly tough. I have studied the former USSR's national volleyball team's training methods so I know. Their was nothing "limited" about it: They would train all night long, no rest, no food, no water. 'Just like Stalin and his henchmen used to work all night, like Gulag prisoners would work until they died. And on the subject of Stalin: The author MISQUOTES Joseph Stalin saying people should do "limited sets." Joseph Stalin never said that, unless it was when he was drunk or perhaps on June 21, 1941 (when he refused to believe the Germans were going to invade the USSR). Stalin's system was built on excessive, extended physical punishment to EVERYBODY, friends and foes. That is the complete opposite of "limited" work, and what the author of this book is trying to sell. If the Soviet Union was built or run using the principles offered in this book it would have become part of Nazi Germany in 1941.   This book is a pretty good PR job, but misses the mark completely. 
 When I first saw this movie, I thought it was pretty stupid. I'm sure you all have your oppinions, but really, can you believe the CGI? The animation in this show leaves a lot to be desired. The creatures don't even blend in with their environment, and they all look smooth as clay. No texures evident at all! And the theories? Oh boy, how do I explain this, other than saying it was complete RUBBISH!!! Let me just state a few theories that had me rolling with laughter! First, there is the thought that tortises would evolve into creatures that grew to be larger than the largest dinosaur! Second, you have flying fish that look like and sound like fish, and can actually......well.....FLY!!! Finally, this thought almost made me die of laughter; squids will emerge from the water and INHERIT the Earth!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!?????!!!!!??! This is not science people! True science is something you can study first-hand, and examine in a lab for goodness sake!!! Evolution itself is still a theory in question, and suddenly, scientists believe that they can predict evolution's every move? Even in the distant future!?! Then again, I don't see why they can't, because this "theory" was made up by man in the first place!!! Finally, the names of these "future" creatures were so stupid with a capital "S", that I nearly urinated in my jeans when I heard names like, Flish, Snowstalker, Sharkopath, and Toraton! But look at the bright side, this could be a new idea for, yet another, expansion pack to the Pokemon series. Overall.......Oh whatever you know my opinion: If you are gullible and closed minded toward this pseudo-science, then be my guest. Put your brain in a blender, bring a bucket of popcorn with you, and have a blast! On the other hand, if you are more open minded toward genuine facts, then please....do yourself a favor, and watch more realistic, less evolution based programs, such as the "Walking With..."series, and it's spin-offs.    
 In this fast world of ours, I just wanted to be able to make a code-breaker, but NO!! I tlked to the guy on the hotline, and he treated me like ****! 
 This purported economist cherry picks his stats (a common historical comparison of his hodgepodge of stats would provide greater credence) in order to substantiate his position that Americans are infected with a consumption fever.  Although his overall contention about the increased consumption of "luxury goods" is true, his patent moralizing discredits what should otherwise be his nonbiased academic standing and casts doubts about his recommendations.  What is even more offensive is his implicit assumption that Americans are weak & stupid because of things such as the proliferation of credit cards "causes" them to spend beyond their means.  This assumption is akin to overweight Americans blaming McDonald's for their obesity.   This book is for you if you believe that government officials (i.e. Big Brother) should be the arbiters of your behavior and that the individual is never to blame or to take the consequences of his/her actions. I recommend reading "Living It Up" by Twitchell instead. 
 I picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that Pirate's Booty was a great product. These tasted rather odd to me and I wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible. Puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don't go well together in my opinion. It might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste, but that was not the case here 
 My husband bought me this microphone to replace a broken mike for my Audiostream AS 222 karaoke machine.  It works - badly, so I give it one star.  You can't hear anything out of this mike - it's going back to whence it came from.  Buh bye 
 this tor breakes when you build tall buildings, but I made a mouse out of them. when the magnets are pushed back that makes me angry, but you can make people by just putting four magnets on one ball, but in all I say you shuld decide yourself. 
 Great texbook.  However, has too many mistakes.  Answers are not reliabl 
 Obviously I am a disgruntled chemistry student. I will be graduating Cum Laude this spring, and I just suffered through Quantitative Analysis using this book. The problems do not match the examples, there is little background given to the concepts described, and there is no study guide that shows the methods needed to solve problems. My Thermal Physics instructor finally gave up using another Saunders book for the same reasons. Saunders books are more devoted to working problems than describing or teaching the processes that occur. I urge any instructors considering this book to look for a different text! 
 I usually really enjoy Jayne Ann Krentz and her alter ego Amanda Quick, but I actually returned this one to the library unfinished. I found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
 It is shameful that "Best Friend" Billy Noonan felt the need to dish about John Kennedy and his family.  We all know that John valued his privacy and one would think that he would be horrified at this betrayal. The sorriest thing about this book is that it is so boring.  We learn nothing new about John, Carolyn or even Jackie. Skip this book - Carole Radziwell's book is much better 
 I bought this DVD on the basis that Shania Twain performed the half time show. Even when i did a search for Shania Twain this DVD was listed - INCORRECTLY - as there is NO Shania performance on the DVD. As far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the UK and know nothing about American Footbal - sorry!! 
 I read this book just coming out of high school, 8 years or so ago.  At the time, I subscribed to Harris's dating philosophy.  Having just come out of a few defunct relationships, this book provided the answer that I was looking for: our commitment-phobic dating culture is the problem.  The solution: pursue relationships in an extreme, counter-culture fashion.    Now that I'm older, married, and a little wiser, I see this book for what it is:  a knee-jerk reaction that is a reflection on Harris's inexperience and immaturity at the time.  Having come out of a few bad relationships himself, he identified what he thought was the problem (the commitment-phobic dating culture), and scoured the Bible for "proof-texts" that coincided with his solution for the problem, like any good evangelical would do.    Why not to follow the relationship advice this book prescribes?  Well, I'm sure for many people it will work out just fine.  Just like dating works out just fine in establishing lasting relationships with many people.  The big danger I see in this book (and Boy Meets Girl, for that matter), is that natural, healthy sexual desire is going to be stifled to an unhealthy extent.  This could very well create long-term problems in the relationship, the way repressing any kind of feeling for long periods of time does.  Why do preacher's kids often end up in so much trouble?  Because they repressed the need for rebelling and discoving their individuality as adolescents.  These kinds of repressed behavior have a way of catching up with you.    Obviously, we cannot always be acting on every impulse.  That would certainly screw a person up faster than regimented discipline.  Like most things in life, a person needs to find a healthy balance.  Now for some people, saving any kind of physical contact until engagement can be perfectly healthy.  But for the vast majority, I suspect not.  Ultimately, you are going to need to find this balance yourself, and if reading this book is part of your quest to do so, then take what Harris says with a boulder of salt.  
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 People who did this atlas wanted to cut their job and limited the Eastern Europe by deviding it by two parts. One and very big part of the Eastern Europe is not in the Historical Atlas. The biggest European countries such as Ukraine and Russia as well as other countries - Baltic states, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, etc. are not concidered to be Europe in so called Historical Atlas of the Eastern Europe. I would reccomend the authors to get some geography lessons before making any other job.. 
 One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun.  Quite the reverse.  He has cut it in half.  The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either.  Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half.  Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes  Even the plot is tissue-thin.  The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring.  Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction.  As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one.  He is capable of far better.  
 Sorry, I just cannot believe that the "humorous" and "honest" approaches recommended in this book will work. It all seems very idealistic, flaky and undignified. I value honesty (and humor too!) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum. I would find someone using these strategies very off-putting -- the words "sense of entitlement" come to mind. And I am not conservative. So what would a conservative employer think 
 As a long-time of fan I was disgusted by both the movie and the book. Jordan tries his hand here but comes way short of the previous books. He should just stick to WOT 
 I bought these today so that I could review an mp3 presentation.  As soon as I put the headphone on I wanted to take them back!  It has the most annoying buzzing sound.  What Philips means what they say "Noise Canceling" is that the buzzing sound will drown out all background noise!  Well I'm taking these back 
 I hate these new taller books.  Supposedly they are easier to read....actually they are just more money for the publishers.  The reason I buy paperbacks is because they are less expensive.  Then the publishers all got together and decided to shaft the paperback customer by offering some releases only in the taller size for 2 dollars more.  I read 3 books a week, so I can't afford to waste money for a larger book with the same story.  Does it add anything to the book?  No, just more cost.   I refuse to buy this book on principle.  Maybe if my library has the hardcover I will borrow it from them, but I refuse to put more money in the publishers' coffers when they aren't offering this in the normal paperback size.  If it was really for the reader's benefit that they offer the larger size, they would offer both sizes to better serve the consumer. I have seen only the taller book in every store I have visited, there is no regular paperback of this story.  
 yes, i bought this & read it. wel, it may make you feel less like it's "your fault!" if you're infertile, but it's important to know the facts. most women menstrate into their 50s, but become infertile between 38-42. your chances of conceiving w/ your own eggs, even with ivf, after 43 is like 0.02%, OR, in layman's terms, not good. NONE of these fertility books tell you that. and for every woman, like the author of "Inconceivable," which I also read, who conceive, literally hundreds more won't. the moviestars over 40, like Geena Davis, who you see in redbook, etc., are getting pregnant through IVF with DONOR eggs.  but they don't tell anyone, keeping the pregnant over 40 myth going.... i guess there's a lot o shame w/ infertility, which leads to people like me casting about for answers since "it worked for them," thinking, "if only i could drink as much wheatgrass as HER!!!" & "ooo! what's HER secret, and how much will she charge me for it?"  (bye the bye, i found the book "inconceivable" terribly upsetting and sad & not helpful. plus, she was trying for her 2nd baby, and hearing her whine feels like a slap when YOU think she's so lucky to even have 1!)  one "bit" of "magic" i did find... acupuncture. it regulated my cycle, and going twice a week can improve a man's sperm by 60% research shows. plus it's relaxing and AFFORDABLE, which Dr. Domar's programs (I live near her LA branch) aren't. otherwise, save your money, or join RESOLVE (www.resolve.org)and maybe you can "book swap" with fellow members... my best advice, go to a reproductive endocrinologist asap, & find out what's really happening. it set our minds at ease, even though all the news wasn't good. most importantly... strive to keep your relationship happy and loving and sexy.  hang in there; you have my entire sympathy & empathy. good luck & i wish all of us babies :) 
 Hush is a shallow and blatant 'monster mash' of characters disguising itself as an epic. culminate Batman story. Everything from Lee's generic and derivative character re-imagings (like what you'd expect to find in something produced by Image comics) to the plot. And by plot, I mean the tiringly episodic reintroduction of a character followed by quick battle and then 'on to the next one', sequence that only stops at the unveiling of a new, non compelling villain. In other words, if you're into mainstream american comics, you'll love this. If you want a real Batman story, Check out "Long Halloween," Alan Moore's "Killing Joke", Frank Miller's 'Dark Knight Returns" and Neil Gaiman's "Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth 
 This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!  This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writting was dead on as always and character development was good.  This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book 
 I never recieved this watch and about 30 or so days later Amazon refunded  my payment. I don' understand why this supplier could not come up with such a common item but I got my money back so I am not upset. This is why I try not to buy from an Amazon seller, preffering to buy directly form the Amazon site 
 I have an extensive math background and found this book tough to read. Not because the math described is particularly complicated (it is most definitely not...high school algebra is sufficient), but because Ross' writing style is too verbose. 99% of readers should know the meaning of "average," yet Ross devotes a lot of text to explaining this concept. I'm not sure who his audience is. Math-savvy people may feel that concepts have been dumbed-down and over explained, but math-phobic people may be scared off by the use of formulas...and the majority of times they aren't really needed anway 
 This was a really great story told in a really cool way but with this last book it almost all gose down hill. What was mistrious is now sappy a qultia. This is the down fall of the a great story 
 Google the words Foster Cline and Attachment Therapy, and be prepared to lose your lunch. Happy research 
 Just like Medicine Woman I am not sure whether or not to believe just how much of this is to. Too many Beverley Hills like fantastical sequences of how strange people come in and out of the story. Is there really a Red Dog? Or and Agnes Whistling Elk. And the whole shapeshifting seems really bizarre outside a metaphorical use. Great read, deep descriptions of the Yucutan, and perhaps Lynne really does take some fascinating trips to the world in search of aboriginal wisdom. My one question: Are the Native community that are the keepers of this sacred tradition sharing the royalities from Andrews Production Company? 
 I have come accustomed to reading Janette Oke's thought-provoking books, but this one did none of the sort. This has little romance, which also surprises me, and the plot drags on and on; it never really seems to get anywhere to me. I read it in a day, but not because it was good, but because I just wanted to finish so I could read another book. I would not recommend this one. 
 This was the first Tami Hoag novel for me, and it will be my last. After reading such great reviews I expected more from this veteran author. What promised to be a murder mystery was, in fact, no mystery at all. After the first couple of chapters I had surmised "who done it," and by mid-novel I had wrapped up the rest of the so-called loose ends. This detective story is Mickey Spillane gone very long and very predictable 
 This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.  Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary.   If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.  I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third. 
 I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards. The phone will say "Insert SIM Card" even if it is inside. It recyles, and when it does so, the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped. There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics, ringtones, and games.  You cannot change the mini display. Save your money because you might end up spending 40-50 bucks on SIM cards, and another 50 for a replacement phone. 
 The book should cost not more then $20 based on the information contained.  Much of the information is either watered down or appears in his first book.  Needless to say I was not impressed with the book 
 No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his "experimental school." Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of "progressivism?" I would.  Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance?  Deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their "natural inquisitiveness" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the "plus-que-parfait" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.  90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. Dewey's "progressivism" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one 
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 I think that I am clearly insane, but I did not like this book. Everyone else in the world likes this book, but i am the insane person who does not. And I'm NOT sarcastic! I could barly read it a second time. I hated this book. 
 The charger unit or the batteries (or both) don't work right: I use the batteries one at a time, in rotation to power my Zen MP3 player. Sometimes I put discharged batteries in the charger, plug it in, the light blinks red, then goes off.  Only supposed to show either red (discharged, charging) or green (fully charged.)  This morning 3 batteries show fully charged, I take one out, it is discharged. All these problems happened with a first unit, I returned it to Monster and after they took their sweet time, got a replacement which works just as erratically. Monster's stuff looks good, but it is the last time I am going to buy their brand 
 Lucy and Ann are the best of friends.  They even share a twin bed together.  Ann gazes at Lucy during long, leisurely, naked baths.  Ann does Lucy's bidding, whatever the personal or financial cost.  I was shocked by Lucy's demands--and more shocked by Ann's willingness to comply, like a leashed dog.  I kept expecting Ann to go down on Lucy, what with all the kissing, sleeping together, and long, hard stares.  This book reminded me of the art house film 9 and half weeks, except for the fact that in this case the portagonists are both females 
 Once again, I placed the order for this book February 3 and have yet to receive it.  Either this lady is EXTREMELY popular or the publisher just publised enough books to cover her family and friends.  I am not happy 
 I realize that all the previous reviewers are from other parts of the world and I am from the part of the world so peculiarly described by Mr. Meredith --- and maybe I know better, and maybe I am biased. But I think Mr. Meredith has decided to do a powerful portrait in black (if I may say so) of the whole of Africa, and given that his book is almost entirely descriptive, the portrait is powerful enough indeed. The review from the gentleman from Bangladesh states the ultimate conclusion that one might have if one ignores the fact that Africa is still pretty much colonized, and that it is not so much that the Whites are gone as that they are hidden (only their helping hand is made visible). In any case, my overall impression is that the book is very informative on many of the crimes and horrors that have plagued Africa since the inception of the colonial era (with a concentration on the post-colonial period) but totally neglects the best programs of social and political emancipation which, by the way, can be symbolized by Mandela and Senghor only from a Western point of view. From an African point of view, Mandela has not had the chance to be a real leader and Senghor was a puppet of French neo-colonialism. The real leaders were people like Modibo Keita, Thomas Sankara, Seyni Kountche, in the Francophone countries that I know best. The author also ignores the economic structure of today's Africa, which is only beginning to shift from the colonial polarization to the emergence of an internal market, not without success in some cases, and tragedies in others. I think if the author had been less the journalist that he is by profession, in order to illuminate his narrative with structural analyses, he would have given a more complete vision of the continent, and one that would have made more sense of its evolution. Furthemore, living in Africa, one does not necessarily have the sense of violent decline that is described here. I am from a country which didn't know a single year of civil war, or ethnic brawl. There have been three coups d'etat, which on the whole I think were beneficial to the country. We now have a democratic system. I don't like our politicians: I don't think they have intelligent designs for the country, and they aren't at all above corruption. We have dire economic problems. But life there is peaceful, a bit drowsy and has its many charms. I should add that I am from the better-off section of society and that might taint my vision. But really, I do not have the impression of living in the hell pit of bloody feuds and utter corruption (I am 35, and have so far never had the occasion to bribe a civil servant in my country, although I know very well that corruption exists) that emerges from this book, and I'd venture to say that many Africans out of the warring areas will think that the book is a bit much. My general experience is that countries differ a lot, despite the kind of uniformity that Mr. Meredith sought to impose on us in this book. I won't be happy in Nigeria for instance. I liked Ghana. I am not desperate. I think we need peace and time, and the kind of help that works on structures (education and health) not on symptoms (corruption and poverty). Mr. Meredith book isn't helpful in that sense, and that's why although I found it informative, I never recommend it. 
 I rated this a 2 only because it is not what I expected, I'm really not qualified to rate it's accuracy. This book is more a botanical treatise than I expected. Lots of artwork and diagrams for the person who wants to draw/paint the most accurate trees in great detail 
 I got this book because of the fame of John Gary and the big title of the book. I managed to go through half of the book and finally, I cannot stand it and throw it away.  Basically, this book gives you 9 principles to bring miracles to your life, like eating healthy, love as if it is your first love, blablablah. Yeah, it is true, but it is also totally vain and misleading. For example, everybody knows that if you eat healthy food and work out intensively four times a week, two hours each time, you will definitely be fit as supermodel. But, can anybody really do that if somebody just told you to do so? It has to be tricky to deal with like finding the right and affordable workout program, finding the incentive, etc.  What I found ridiculous is that John kept saying that if you believe in his nine principles, then you can do whatever you want. Even superman cannot do that! Well, John, have you accomplished all of your wishes in your life? Belief is necessary for any success, but it is not a guarantee for all successes.  Also, John made some metaphors to prove his points, but most of them don't make enough or any sense, at least to me. Another reason I hate the book is that it takes the first 1/3 to boast his former achievements, like 12 bestsellers, without touching the core topic of this book.  If you are looking for practical miracles in this book, I assure you that you will be practically disappointed, period 
 I couldn't get the remote to work with my TIVO.  That is why I purchased it, 
 If any performer deserves an authoritative biography, it is Bert Williams, who with his partner George Walker, broke the color barrier on Broadway.  After illness forced Walker into retirement just after reaching stardom, Williams joined the Ziegfeld Follies, where he worked with many show business legends, among them Eddie Cantor and W. C. Fields. Over the years, Cantor told many wonderful stories about the dignity, humanity, and generous nature of Bert Williams. They're not in the book and Cantor is barely mentioned. Fields described Williams as, "The funniest man I ever saw and the saddest man I ever knew."  This book manages to garble the poignant quote and avoid attributing it to Fields, whose name doesn't appear in the index.  While the work contains one or two interesting insights, they are buried under a mountain of trendy academic buzz-words and faux-insightful attempts to attribute Williams with all things good or funny (or both), under the sun. This has the paradoxical effect of diminishing the work of a great artist and obscuring the life of a man who was honestly and justly pained by his life in late 19th and early 20th century America. Rejected by whites because he was black, Williams found little welcome in the black community because he was West Indian.  As it was during his life, so it is with this book: Williams deserves better. In what could have been a fascinating account of the man's life and times, he is barely visible behind a blizzard of witless theorizing designed to wow the Ph.D. set.  "The Last 'Darky': Bert Williams, Black-on-Black Minstrelsy, and the African Diaspora," isn't about its subject, its about its audience. 
 I hate pop-culture nostalgia, the ossifying instinct that leads people to think that their fond memories of a TV show/rock band/movie/book render it a classic and that everything that came after that particular, rosy-in-memory TV show/rock band/movie/book is either inferior or a retread. Nostalgia closes the mind rather than opens it to new experiences.  What qualifies a person to be a critic is an overabundance of nostalgia.  They can never see a movie without comparing it to the groundbreaking movies of old, yet they don't seem to realize, that there is not a lot of ground left to break.  Rather than watch a movie for what it is, a movie, created to entertain the people and nothing more, they would rather bash and destroy it.  They rarely find the good in movies because they are so intent in finding the bad.    It also raises the question that has been floating on my mind for as long as I have been an avid viewer of movies and an appreciator: why is a movie being popular a setback?  I constantly find that a movie can only get a good review if the public has never heard of it.  Critics think that they can treat the public like fools.  They think that they can trick people into falling out of the mainstream.  I hear too many people complaining about no good movies coming out in the theaters.  I work at a theater and I see nearly every movie, including the independent ones, with one to two showings a day/week.  I can tell you from personal experience that the luster of movies is still fresh and alive and not dead as Roger Ebert and many other critics would have you believe.  I watch independent films all the time.  I don't know why I do, because I constantly find myself not liking them.  Many of them have convoluted plots, weak acting, and very few redeaming qualities.  There are of course movies that I love and always will, but I am constantly adding to that list.  People have to realize that as our society advances, improvements are made, and movies will only get better over time.  Take the Matrix for example.  Is there really a reason for this movie not to be hailed among the likes of such classics as Indiana Jones.  I definitely thought it was better than either of the Anime films that Roger Ebert chose for his list.  The Matrix was extroardinary and replaced my all time favorite action movie, which was Goldfinger.  It had memorable characters, an inventive and extremely well-executed plot, and thrillingly heart-pounding action.  Ebert said it was excellent, except it "retreated to formula" at the end.  But what is wrong with the formula?  If someone liked a movie, you would recommend something similar.  But critics hate anything that is similar to anything else.  If every scene has never been done anywhere in history, it is a good movie.  Other than that, a movie can never be better than good.    Roger Ebert should realize this.  He is a very influential critic, and he should set the precedent from which all movie critics should try to adhere.  Yet he doesn't take risks.  He likes what everyone else likes.  He hates what everybody else hates.  That is why this list is so similar to every top 100 list ever created by an esteemed critic.  While the critics agree, it seems that the people don't.  Why can't we all just get along?  Why do reviewers hold spite for what is popular, and why do people not watch what critics love?  The answer is simple: people love movies, critics hate them 
 It's ideas are sound, but it's all stats. This year there was this much and hey look now it's tripled, quadrupled, whatever... Just reading the conclusions of each chapter will give you everything that you need to know. 
 This pillow was hard as a rock and very uncomfortable. you might as well lay on your bed without any pillows if you are going to lay with this flat, uncomfortable, hard plank of a wood of a pillow. 
 This is the worst cookbook I have ever used, and I have a lot of cookbooks. While the photos depict mouthwatering dishes, every recipe I have tried has one, if not multiple, faults. These were clearly never tested. Amounts, temperatures, times, pretty much anything and everything is wrong. As an example, a recipe that claims to make 12 cupcakes produces enough batter for 24, and enough frosting for 48! A recipe for roasted veggies calls for a baking temperature of 325 -- maybe after six hours that would roast a root vegetable, but I'm not so sure. At best, this can give inspirational ideas for those with enough skill to make it on their own. At worst, it's a series of failed recipes and wasted ingredients. With so many other great vegan cookbooks out there, I have decided, after giving this book plenty of chances, that this is not worth the space on my shelf 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 I bought this book based on a review, not from actually seeing it. Had I paged through it, I would not have purchased it. There were a couple of interesting ideas in this book but I found most projects to be too quirky for my tastes. If I could return it, I would 
 I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book.   I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.    I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 I was attracted to the theme of this book, but the author makes you work excessively hard in getting to the core. This book could have used a redraft and/or a good hard edit - I was struggling to get through it and skipped quite a lot of it. Not because I have a short attention span, but because of the repetition and focus on boring minutiae, which I don't think adds anything to the story. I'm not sure whether the author thinks her readers are unable to grasp subtleties therefore need everything spelled out for them, but I feel this could have been fixed with further drafting - it really has the feel of being a little undercooked. Better editing would have also fixed the misuse of many complex words and phrases, which you do not expect to read when the format is letters from a professional travel writer (the narrator). All power to the author for winning the 2005 Orange prize and achieving success in a tough market, but I would not rush out to read her other books 
 I bought this mainly for the Solieri Version of Rock Me Amadeus. It is the version but shorter, over a minute, than the original. I wish I could find where to download/buy the exact version that came on Falco 3 released in the US back in 1985. Anyway, with 18 songs on this CD, if you like 9 or more of the songs ... it's worth buying. If you only like a couple of the songs, you would probably be better off buying them from downloads 
 The 3 T-Shirts we ordered were not as pictured and were smaller than the size guide.  We did, however, receive a refund less shipping costs after many phone calls to the seller and amazon.  The seller does not promtly return phone calls 
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 This product feels like grain on the face, I don't care for that feel. They should improve that. Other wise I suppose it does the job 
 After downloading the file, i have not been able to view the movie, it keeps ont trying to get a license, much simpler using movielink or vongo 
 There are many words that came to my mind when I first saw these two movies: overblown, pointless, cruel, boring, disappointing, the list goes on and on.  So many things are horribly wrong with this cartoony mess, that it doesn't bear any resemblance to the (brilliant) original trilogy anymore.  In that respect, Episode I isn't nearly as atrocious as Episode II, and that's already saying a lot.  First of all, I don't know how long it took George Lucas to write the scripts for these films, and, actually, it doesn't really matter because IF he put any effort into them, it didn't show on screen, but the dialogues are so wooden that you might as well turn off the sound and read the subtitles only.  Now that we've established that the lines every actor was forced to say are horrendous, it can't look good for the characters either, can it? You can't blame the actors if you consider that they virtually had nothing to work with. Not a single character in these sorry efforts looks convincing, except for Natalie Portman.  Christiansen's helpless attempts at "doing some acting", Jar Jar Binks' infantile jumping around (in one of the many "all time low" scenes on Tatooine, he steps into some dog poo), Young-Ani's witty "Oops", "Let's get out of here" and "Yeah" lines ... not a single minute passes without a cringe- worthy moment. After four hours of pure nonsense and some of the worst "going through puberty" moments, a wacky CGI Yoda who bounces off walls doesn't even hurt anymore.  Even some of Christopher Lee's horror flicks are on a higher niveau.  And when I noticed that the chemistry between Portman and the kid who plays young Anakin Skywalker is better than the chemistry between her and Hayden Christiansen, then I finally realised that these films have no saving grace to speak of whatsoever.  And I mean NO saving grace. It's just aching in my stomach when legendary composer John Williams has to step down to this level and underline the worst clichés with some stomach- wrenching Hollywood B- movie love and action music.  Now the effects. Hailed by so many people out there who call them fantastic or a work of art. Now, this may be my personal point of view, but CGI is there to enhance the movie, to put something on screen that you couldn't have done in any other way. The gigantomany Lucas put on screen is no art. The art is to make it look real, touchable.  That's what made the original trilogy, or Lord Of The Rings, tick: that the viewer can indulge into this world.  And CGI is not the only tool; miniatures can look great, good make-up and costumes, animatronics, and so on. CGI is not the solution of everything. You need some skills to make this world look real, which Lucas seemingly doesn't have.  Everything is so smooth and flawless that it just looks artificial. Look at the Clone army and compare it to the Uruk- Hai army in The Two Towers.  See now why Lord of the Rings got the Oscar and not Episode II?  And the depressing thing is that after seeing the trailer for Episode III, it seems like we're getting another flick of the same pattern. With Hayden Christiansen! Hooray!  Get out the earmuffs, here it comes!  I could give it an additional star because there's unintentional amusement value in these flicks 
 "Midnight Warrior" is the kind of book that you read for the sex, because you would be sadly disappointed if you actually read it for the historical accuracy or the "romance".  Iris Johansen is a master at depicting heroines who, having come from less than dazzling backgrounds, find inner strength.  Amazingly, even at their angriest, these women never swear, which is more than can be said for the "heroes".  A more bull-headed lot of males I have never read about--!  Oh, well, perhaps I am being unfair because I am not a Johansen fan...but, the only way for you to find out is to read a Johansen book for yoursel 
 Though I'm a great fan of Gleick's other books, I found Faster annoying in the extreme.  True, it is replete with fascinating facts and insights.  After a couple of chapters, however, many of its fascinating facts and insights -- not infrequently organized into endless prose lists -- began to feel like so many bricks to the skullcap, waterdrops to the forehead, ...  Enough was enough was enough.  I listened to Faster (audiotape) on my commute to work.  Mornings 3-8 felt like Groundhog Day.    F(un/interesting 15 page magazine article) + C(affeine) + OCD + T(ime) +/- P(er-word-payment) = Faster.              
 Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect 
 Did not expect much for 10 bucks... but give me a break, 2 weeks and the plastic streched and tore around the handle up on top of the smoker.  I think a heavy duty trash bag is what this product is equivalent to 
 This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say 
 I've had this scanner for 6 months now.  It worked OK the first month, but since then it loves to "eat" paper. It scans multiple pages at once.  For example, a 20 page document, becomes 15 pages one scanned.  I have to scan the same document multiple times (sometimes up to 12 times) until the scanner finaly scans each page. It gets to be very frustrating, actually, it's the worse piece of office equipment I ever purchased. Otherwise it works fine 
 This is a good example of a book about Ukraine written by a person with a Russian mindset - crucial points about understanding the Ukrainian culture, spirit and sense of independance are wrong. Buy and read this book if you want to know about all Russian misconceptions of Ukraine. Otherwise choose someone more knowledgeable. Two other reviewers made good points about what's wrong with the book, which you can notice even without reading it: 1) The explanation of the origin of the name of the country is wrong. This has been an issue of fierce scientific debates between true historians and pro-Russian communist pseudo-scientists who preferred to see Ukraine only as a border of the bigger Russain empire; 2) peasants on the cover of the book look really dirty, uneducated and backwards - like Ukraine doesn't have writers, scientists, cultural artifacts, national symbols over more than 2000 years of its history - well, there are millions of things she could have chosen for the cover of her book.  Sorry for the people reading this book and thinking they actually understand where Ukrainian sense of national identity and independence is coming from 
 I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time 
 In school you are sometimes asked to summarize extremely lengthy books into one or two sentences to evaluate your knowledge on that certain piece of literature.  To me, that always seemed ridiculous because how could you accurately depict the true value of a 300-page book within two measly paragraphs?  That feeling is exactly my reaction to Ridley Scott's overly produced and underly executed film, Legend.  Throughout the film I felt that Scott had the potential to go anywhere and everywhere, really making this underground cult fantasy film bigger than The Neverending Story and Lord of the Rings put together.  I felt this way because 80s fantasy films seemed to be less commercial and more imaginative than those released in the past decade.  I was waiting for a stronger outing of Willow, but instead I saw Legend disintegrate right before my eyes.  It was as if Ridley had 300-plus pages of material, but had to condense it all into two very small paragraphs.  What ultimately happened was that we, the viewer, were cheated out of quite a bit of potential visuals, creative lands, and mythical creatures.  We were instead handed a body of work that seemed to grasp at straws instead of development, weak heroic characters with an exaggeration on Curry's over-the-top "Price of Darkness" portrayal, and a finale that teetered on sarcasm instead of excitement.    Legend, in my eyes, begins with an unsettling "bang".  We see no characters outside of a menacing voice that speaks in rhyme and talks about the end of light.  Scott pulls us gracefully in by giving us these highly imaginative characters and a world that we think will be full of Hensen-esque creatures.  Alas, immediately after pulling at our dark sides, he slaps us in the face with what seems like an hour of pointless drivel with conversation between the Princess Lilly and her man-boy Jack (played by Mia Sara and Tom Cruise respectively).  Caught between horrid writing, unfamiliar past experiences, and a uni-brow the size of Kansas on Cruise's face, we are left with nothing to do except wait.  With the promise of unicorns and a possible dark future, we wait.  The unicorns finally appear and darkness does become momentarily triumphant, but what never brings us back to that immediate opening of dark delight is that Scott never recreates it for us.  Legend fails, not just because of the shallow acting, but because the story never quite hits the momentum it had at the beginning of the film.  While this critic blames Ridley's choice of Sara and Cruise as our guides, I do think he could have strengthened the story to be a bit more energetic and sweeping.  I felt trapped throughout this story, as if the walls that contained Princess Lilly were the actual boundaries of the film.  This hurt Legend.  Unlike other fantasy films of this nature, the walls of a structure may encase our hero, but we know there are bigger and more exotic things happening around the fictional planet.  With Legend, I never felt that.  I felt as if Scott kept us on a lighted path without the comfort or luxury of any outside imagination.  I needed, maybe even wanted, to see more of this planet Scott created, but the door was shut abruptly in my face.  I would like to state again that I thought Scott had good intentions with this film, but the final result (either from its original bad screenings to the infamous "director's cut") just didn't feel like it was worth the two hours one had to put into the movie.  Scott had some (I stress "some") moment of excitement, moments of imagination, and moments of sheer fantasy, but they were all clouded by the brazen push of over-the-top melodrama and visions.  What makes most fantasy films work is that you care both for the story as well as the characters.  In Legend, the story seems weak because we care nothing for the characters.  Cruise's portrayal of Jack could have been done by anyone who passed Acting 101, while Curry does give the BEST performance of the film, it is another case of "anyone-itis".  Without the horns or the bold eyes, anyone could have been underneath the mask.  Curry did great, but take him out of the costume and ask the question, does he stand-alone?  Follow this up with some elves and dwarves that seemed more clichï¿½ than original, and the final result is an ill-fated Legend.  I wanted to like this film.  I knew about the cult-ish status of Scott's fantasy attempt, but in the end, I felt bored instead of moved by the overall picture.   Overall, I cannot recommend a second viewing to this film.  I went in expecting a larger-than-life Willow or Neverending Story (or at least enough darkness to counter Alien or Blade Runner), but instead finished the film thinking that in today's standards this would have counted as a "direct to video" release.  Scott, as well as his brother, are fabulous directors and continue to push the boundaries on modern cinema, but Legend failed.  Legend failed because of the story as well as the acting.  Both were not in place, therefore, both could not work together.  During the commentary, Scott mentions his passion for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, but it was obvious that he was just name-dropping to gain film critic's respect.  Legend, if anything, insults Cocteau's masterpiece.  From the wrongly used word of the title (not a legend but a fairy-tale), to Cruise's uni-brow, to the cheaply forgettable ending, Legend didn't impress and it would be very difficult to sit through another viewing without some cash in hand.             Grade: ** out of **** 
 This story of a chid id poverty-stricken India was hard to keep reading. The lack of plot put me right to sleep. I got a few chapters in and couldn't finish it. Don't waste your money on this 
 I own the 2001 edition, which is awkwardly written, very poorly edited, and difficult to use as a reference.  Many photos appear to be xeroxes of movements rather than photos, and are illegible.  Many actual photos are of such poor quality as to be essentially useless. There is no index, no attempt to provide cross-reference material (such as calibres common to a set of watches).  Even the table of contents contains an error.  This book often gives the appearence of being thrown together solely as a vehicle for the many advertisements from various watch sellers that appear within it.  A much better method of pricing watches - more accurate, colorful and more up-to-date - would be to look at auction catalogs.    Not recommended 
 The straightener works ok. It straightens my hair better when it is dry. I have very course hair. I still had to blow dry it to get it to straighten out, and go over it a few times to really make it straight. The remington is to thick, so you can not style the hair at all with it. The worst part about this particular straightener is when I leave it plugged in and have it shut off it keeps making a beeping sound?? I have to unplug it to make it stop. I just bought a chai straightner for about three times the cost of this, it is only 1 inch thick so it styles the hair very nice, but it straightens my hair the same as the remington. I have only had it a few weeks, so I am intrested to see if the chai causes less damage as it claims then other straighteners 
 HE SOULD KEEP WRITING RYMES FOR OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE RBX AND THE WORK HE DOES WITH OTHERS BUT ON HIS OWN NOT SO GOO 
 I found this book engaging and entertaining, however was led to believe by the promotional materials that it would be a bit denser with information.  If one edited out the personal anecdotes, endless references by the author to her own credentials (yes, yes, you have an advanced degree as does a substantial percentage of the population, please on to the information now) and "chimpanzees lite," the book would be a leaner (50+ pages maybe) read rather than the slightly bloated tome it currently is.  Perhaps this is the publisher's fault.  Read it for the insightful and charming stories of the author's own well loved pooches.  For information on primatology, go to the horses' mouths (primatologists - many fine accessible books available).  For information on dog behavior, perhaps there is more out there 
 until Meltzer blithered out the most vitriolic, senseless, self effacing, guilt plagued indictment of white people Ive ever had the displeasure to get vertigo from. I threw the book straight into the trash after that. A bitter man, and a wasted talent who has done nothing of any worth whatsoever. Meltzer may have the rock game nailed dead, but I cant stomach an ex-rockwriter slandering 500 years of civilization wholesale just because he cant find a better place to live than LA, even if I am half his age. A dimbulb Dadaist flinging offal like a chimp at anything and anyone that gets more attention than he does. What a disappointment 
 There is just one or two (not new) interesting concepts in this book and on top of it, the author could have captured them all in a few pages only. There was not really a good reason to write a this book except for letting us know how incredible IDEO is.  In comparison, "Ten faces of Innovation" is much more informative. Both books are easy to read and entertaining, but lack pragmatic advice. If you have to choose one of them, read "ten faces" only. 
 There were no redeeming qualities in this book. The story - which started with an interesting premise - was so poorly written that it couldn't keep me interested. I plugged along through this book, and by the time I finished, I was desperately wishing that I could turn back the hands of time and NOT waste my time.  The story had no continuity, the characters were relatively vapid, and the flashbacks were utterly annoying. I know that Laymon is supposed to have a great cult following, but based on THIS book, I can't see it. 
 This book is a very quick read, but unfortunately shows all the signs of having been an equally quick write.  I have never before stopped in the middle of reading a book to pull out a pen and write down all the glaring factual errors and omissions that I saw, but Rebels on the Backlot forced me to do just that.  I see that many of the most egregious errors have already been noted by others, but here is some of what I wrote down as I read:  On page 231: "Texas preppie-geek Wes Anderson had made his first movie, Rushmore, based on his experience in prep school, with an utter unknown in the lead, Jason Schwartzman."  Wes Anderson's first film, of course, was Bottle Rocket, not Rushmore.  And, yes, Jason Schwartzman had no previous film acting experience before Rushmore, but was hardly an "utter unknown" to the film world- his family (both the Schwartzmans and the Coppolas) had done a little bit of film work in their past, both in front of and behind the cameras.  Even Waxman might have recognized the mother of this "utter unknown" from all of the Rocky movies.  Traffic star Erika Christensen is identified on page 321 as "Erika Christenssen" and, most howlingly, on page 101 as "Julia Stiles."  Yes, the two actresses do look alike, but that's just absurd.  On page 266, describing the marketing of Fight Club, Waxman writes that "Fincher insisted the studio hire a cutting-edge advertising firm, Weiden + Kennedy, based in Seattle."  Weiden + Kennedy are based in Portland, home of Nike, their biggest client.  They have offices in Portland, New York, Amsterdam, London, Tokyo and Shanghai, but not in Seattle.  On page 194, Waxman describes the profound influence of Aimee Mann's music in the creation of Magnolia, both at the script level, and in the soundtrack.  On the very next page, she describes how writer/director PT Anderson got the idea for the film's rain of frogs, as well as its historical prologue, from "musician and friend Michael Penn, Sean's brother."  Perhaps Waxman is the only person left in the film or music worlds who doesn't know that, besides being Sean's brother, Michael Penn is also Aimee Mann's husband.   This is a sloppy, poorly researched, poorly written, and incredibly poorly edited book.  Reading it, one can easily imagine Waxman's interview subjects seeing how little she knew about her subject, and simply making up absurd lies just to see if she would ever catch them.  Spike Jonze tells her that location scouting was conducted to find an actual half-floor building for Being John Malkovich, and she repeats this claim on page 205.  I'm sure Jonze is enjoying a good laugh over that.  If you are looking for well-written book on this subject matter, I'd stick with Peter Biskind 
 This is the kind of book which asks to be read for hours and hours AND then you go on double check on the internet. E.g. the list of hotels in Santa Cruz refers to the type of traveler who loves to spend more than $250 per night - tripadvisor.com offers a different picture...  While planning a tour I'm looking for a tour guide which gives me distances on the map, smaller maps with an overview about an area or town (not only for SF or Yosemite) and more background information than the frequent use of adjectives ("breathtaking" "the world's most spectacular").  There is a lot in this book BUT... 
 Image is good but microphone has a jackhammer noise, rendering it useless. I only installed it after a few months after purchase or else would have returned it immediately 
 Dr Fjellman probably spends at least 3/4 of his space describing attractions and environs at Walt Disney World, and less than 10% of his space offering any real scholarly analysis of the sociological impacts of WDW.  It's hardly worth the price for the few pages of critique he offers, but if one is looking for a quasi-professorial description of WDW as it was 15 years ago - and especially of the first incarnation of EPCOT Center, this might be entertaining... or you could just read one of the early editions of "Steve Birnbaum Brings You the Best of Walt Disney World" - one of Fjellman's primary sources.  Where I went to college, travel guides were hardly considered valid reference material!  For a better study of Walt Disney's influence on American culture, spend your time and money on "The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life" by Steven Watts; "Married to the Mouse" by Richard Folgesong about the relationship of Walt Disney and Company with Orlando, FL, is also an interesting read 
 Without the strong leading performances of Donald Pleasance or Jaime Lee Curtis (only in this for about 10 minutes) this makes it the worst Halloween film to date. Much has been said about Halloween 4-6. I loved Halloween 4 & 5 and 6 was just okay however Danielle Harris should have been in that one as well. The series picked up again with Halloween: H20 but took another fall with this cheap piece of trash that was just looking to make a quick buck. I would watch Halloween III which doesn't even have the Michael Myers character in it as long as it meant I wouldn't have to be subjected to this again. The actors (acting) were terrible, the plot and storyline was severely weak, and the entire film as a whole just seemed fake and pointless. It's really a shame when a franchise has to be ruined with something like this (I felt the same with Jason X which is set in space). Lame. I'm pretending this one never happened. 
 The best parts of the book are its explanations of telephony plant.  When the book attempts to explain larger industry topic and operational support, it becomes very vague and at times quite inaccurate.  Is good book to give you an idea about the telephony industry, but don't quote it! 
 This book was so horrible. It was given to me by one of my friends for Christmas. I'm so glad I didn't actually part with legal tender for this putrid novel. I forced myself through the book, not caring what happened to any of the characters who were flat and boring. It was the biggest waste of time (like something you'd read in a WGS class). And why is it that the only story I ever come across in anthologies by this woman is "where are you going, where have you been"? Is this her best story? How pathetic.. 
 As a dog lover and past owner of two dogs who will remain in my heart forever, I was disappointed.  Marley would try the patience of a saint.  Instead of being entertaining, the story struck me with sheer frustration. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 I am interested in making a customized RV, and have been finding books on what others have done. This book is a spoof of famous structures, drawn on wheels - and NOT a book on making Vardos, or custom campers and RVs. Not recommended. I returned it immediately 
  Ugggh! On top of being dated and boring, this movie is so RACIST! Intolerance wasn't so fun either, but I liked it's theme better. D.W. Griffith films are not my favorites anyway, but I watched this out of curiosity and all I could say when it ended was UGGGH! "Birth" was stupid, and some of the ideas in it were outlandish. If you want to see a good Griffith film watch Intolerance. D.W. Griffith created the birth of a nightmare. 
 A decent summary, even concise; a basic introduction to the conflagration that is referred to as the First World War.  As others have stated, this book is all three, but at the same time is superficial, pedestrian, and lacking in originality.  For example: "Since the Great War of 1914-1918 was fought on all the oceans of the world and ultimately involved belligerents from every continent, it can justifiably be termed a "world war".  But it was certainly not the first.  European powers had been fighting each other all over the globe for the previous 300 years." Those are the opening sentences in this short hardcover book of 143 (junior-sized) pages.  This book has 7 very simple maps; basically of various maps of Europe at this time, with almost nothing in detail of the battle lines of the conflict.  The author repeatedly mentions lines of defense & areas of attack, but offers no aids herein regarding maps and/or description. What you get from reading this work is not, in short, much better than what you'd get from a fairly decent encyclopedia treatment; and at least there you'd get a few color battle maps instead of the ink lines that suffice in this work.  Yes, this volume is billed as "A very short introduction"; I acknowledge that, and with the limitations that implies.  I just don't see why one would choose this selection; of, in effect, rice cakes simply because you may not be interested in having a heavy meal. My recommendation thus is to look to John Keegan or others for more value, substance, and insight concerning the "Great War". Cheers!   
 I have just finished reading Styron's book Darkness Visible and I have to say that I was quite under whelmed. The reader is left with little insight into Styron's battle with severe depression. Maybe this is just me, but I find that writers seem capable of expressing their feelings of despair and suicide in only in the loftiest of literary terms. Their writing screams, "I'm famous, well respected and admired, therefore I cannot express myself the way that an ordinary person would. That would be too plebeian." That and the frequent name dropping made me feel alienated from the author. For this reason the reader gets no clear understanding of the nature of his depression. We get glimpses but don't feel privy to his deepest thoughts. In fact, I cannot fathom why he even wrote the book. It certainly doesn't speak to the common people - especially those of us who have spend our lives trying to get the mental health system to advocate for us. Many of us are treated more like criminals than someone with a disease that needs adequate treatment - something that is not going to be found in the state mental health institutions in which the ordinary person is held.  Styron's recovery is almost an afterthought. After spending weeks in a psychiatric hospital (I would guess McLean), he is cured. How is he cured - time. Give the illness enough time and the patient will get better. Actually, in my own experience as someone with severe depression with multiple suicide attempts, the passage of time does place a barrier between my suicidal thoughts and my recovery. But time alone does not cure - it postpones. On page 75 (soft cover) Styron states, "Save for the awfulness of certain memories, acute depression inflicts few permanent wounds." Well, bully for him. But I think that he would find most depressives in disagreement with this statement. At least for myself, my depression has left deep wounds for the past 30 years or so.  Apparently, this was Styron's only episode of depression and thoughts of suicide (unless he has relapsed since this book was published). He attributes the causes of his depression to the loss of his mother, his father's illness, abstaining from alcohol (alcohol and mental illness are not a good mix and only worsen a person's symptoms), and turning 60. It's great that he can pinpoint so precisely the origins of his illness. For many people depressed and suicidal we just can't point to the causes of our illness. As research on the brain advances, we know that chemical imbalances in the brain have a lot to do with many mental illnesses. But ask someone who attempts suicide why they wanted to hurt themselves and many times your answer will be, "I don't know - I just don't know."  On page 76 he states, "Most people in the grip of depression at its ghastliest ..... may require on the part of friends, lovers, family, admirers [!], an almost religious devotion to persuade the sufferers of life's worth, which is so often in conflict with a sense of their own worthlessness, but such a devotion has prevented countless suicides." In my experience and that of others, family and friends have no clue as to how to help a person in so much pain. They want to help and be supportive but they don't know how. And who can expect them to? Yes, having support is gratifying but in the end not as helpful as one would hope. For myself, "such devotion" has never stopped me from hurting myself or attempting suicide. When the despair is so great and the spiral down into the abyss is impossible to climb out of, thoughts of family, friends, loved ones are completely absent from my mind. They're gone - insignificant. The only hope is that someone or something can grab my hand and pull me out of that bottomless hole.  Also lacking insight is Styron's statement on 77. He writes about a camaraderie with a celebrated [what else would we expect from Mr. Styron's coterie of friends and admirers] newspaper columnist and good friend who was manic depressive. Because of the commonality of their illnesses, they have "engender[ed] lasting fellowship." So hey, one of the perks of those feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, despair, anguish and pain is that you might be lucky enough to find yourself a good friend.  This is the first time that I have read an account of a man's experience with mental illness. It is not my intention to sound sexist, but my experience in reading women authors writing about their battles with mental illness is that they are much more candid and forthright. I suppose that Styron's stilted and abbreviated account of his recovery from depression could just be the difference in which the opposite genders express their innermost thoughts. 
 There is a version available at Amazon translated by Nicola Luckhurst.  It is excellent, although almost any version would be preferable to Strachey's mechanistic translations of Freud's work.  STUDIES IN HYSTERIA is a seminal study for both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.  It was written by Freud and Breuer.  A long-standing but unfounded lie first told by Freud and passed on by Ernest Jones blames Breuer for abandoning "Anna O"--Bertha Pappenheim, the first analytic patient--because he couldn't handle her falling for him, but in truth he treated her long after the supposed cure he reports here.  A case could be made for Breuer and Pappenheim being the actual originators of psychotherapy as a modern healing method 
 I've used other Falcon guides in Montana, and was very impressed. I admit I haven't fished in Yellowstone yet, and from the other reviews it looks like it's pretty useful.  But from just a reading standpoint, it's not very good. The pictures are terrible, and I don't think there's a picture of a fish in the entire book, if you can believe that. Also, there needs to be an overall map of some kind, so you can figure out where in the park the little maps are. Even if the big map was split into quadrants spread out over several pages it would help alot.  Check out "Fishing the Beartooths" - now that's a great book.  Just my two cents worth 
 The name of this book is very deceptive and makes it sound like it contans follow up stories in the vein of those in Deaver's book "Twisted" (which is also available in audio format). Lo and behold, it's actually just more stories taken from that book. This audio book should have been named something like "Nocuturne and other stories from Twisted". Based on other reviews I've read, I'm not the only one to have been duped. The stories in "Twisted" are good, but jeers to the publisher for pulling this fast one 
 This movie is not grand on a the memoirs scale of "Grande" to me...there are better.  I can't really understand why these flicks of "female depression memoirs" are becoming so popular lately... I could pull my hair out watching the tension and angst of Anjolina Jolie and Brittany Murphy in "Girl Interrupted", but not in "Prozac Nation".  For one, Christina Ricci does not do anything for me as an actress.  Yes, she looks cool in that Moby video, but really...she is just a bug-eyed over-hyped former "goth actress" -she could star in "Memoirs of Winona from Beetlejuice".  Anyway, that said, Ricci at least gets the roll right aesthetically-she has her pants tightly rolled at her ankles, dons the heavy black plastic bangles and rolls her eyes on cue. I can give her credit for these efforts.  She brings out the worst of the 80's -enough shoulder padding to drive anyone to Prozac. What I really dislike is the idea that this book or movie captures a "new" idea.   I think the DVD would be a better "after school special".  It doesn't thrill me or make me feel moved to be a better person.  I can't find anything in the script that says "I am different from most young women's lives at college".  Plenty of talented, smart women make mistakes in college-many abuse drugs, sleep with all the wrong men, and hate their mothers-this one wrote a book and sold it to a publisher.  Where is the taboo here?  Where are the revelations so terrible I need to peek through my fingers just to absorb them slowly? Even "Prozac" isn't tied into the movie physically until the end.  There really is nothing here-just a diary with so-so actors playing out the roles. 
 While I appreciated and generally agreed with the thesis Richard Florida puts forward that creativity is important for society, there were many times when I found his writing `style' to be annoying.  I had almost put the book down after completing the first third of it.  Mr. Florida's sensitivity to criticism and unabashed need to respond to every negative comment he received from his first book made me wonder just how narcissistic this man was.  His ego flows onto each page and sometimes, in my view, gets in the way of his work and feeds a perception that he is not completely objective.  There are many points that get overlooked in his analysis.  Why are people gravitating to Austin, Texas?  Mr. Florida postulates it is because the city is open to new ideas and diverse.  While I am certain that there are people who choose to relocate based on perceptions of how open and diverse a given area is, it makes more sense to look at more practical motivators such as taxes, real estate prices, crime rates, or climate.  Tangible factors such as these get little mention.  The assumption made by Mr. Florida is that a heterogeneous, open society is more creative than a homogenous, closed one.  I guess that Japan and South Korea don't count.  I could go on, but I would not recommend this book.  
 This book, unfortunately, is perhaps a mockery of the author's reputation.  The first few pages (Part 1 and Part 2 - each may be about 10 pages or so) talk about when to short in very abstract sense and then the mechanics of shorting. Part 3 of the book is a gigantic collection of stock charts which provide some "itsy-bitsy" techincal mumbo-jumbo scribbled along a chart with an indicator saying "short here"!!  It borders on amusement at times.  On a serious note, the author does clearly point out that shorting is a risky business and does provide tons of examples.  One could only wish that the author had distilled all the information in his 150 or so charts and actually described "something" that will answer the question posed as the title of the book. It is particulary disappointing that the author wrote one of my all-time favorite investing book,  and I am a big fan of Investors Business Digest.  leaf through this book, but not buy it 
 This is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a Civil War deserter.  Within the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going.  The book was downhill from there.  Page after page described ice and the crew's interminable struggles to get through.  Getting through the book was nearly as interminable.  The reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him, or really understand him at all.  Thus, his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles.  There are elements of fantasy in the book.  Not enough to make it a fantasy, but enough to steer a reader off course.  The scientist on the mission is after a warm Garden of Eden in the middle of the Arctic.  He is mad or it's fantasy, it is hard to know until the end.  There is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in the book) describes how he got his third hand.  From that yarn comes the title "Rope Eater".  The title really has nothing to do with the book, other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain.  Besides the tedious turning of the plot, the characters lack any development.  Only the three handed man and the captain, both tangential characters, had any depth whatsoever.  This book seemed to be an attempt at adventure, but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension.  It never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened.  Although the reader knew the characters must be suffering, it never came through the over-writing.  As one might expect, the crew's mission to find the warm Garden of Eden in the arctic was pointless.  So was this book.  It was a disappointment.  
 What was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn.  It looked as if it had been dropped from a plane!  The entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape.  I would really like to own this bookcase, but I want it delivered in usable condition 
 Yeah, it may be based on a true story.  So what?  That don't make it a good movie, and man oh man, it ain't good at all.  Oooohhh....blue lightning striking.  That's real scary stuff.  Now I know Barbara Hershey can act, and she did what she could with this script, which would have been better used as a doormat.  The doctors, and especially Silver, were so over the top clueless and cliche it was insulting.  Tell me about your father....yeah, right.  Kids were annoying, whiny things and that son was such a rube, albeit a loyal one.  The theme and subject matter are strong and heavy stuff, and this could have worked.  Failed miserably for me though.  Worst ending for a horror flick not just of the era, but for all time.  The mingling of science and horror rarely works, except the Lovecraft flicks and a few others.  The students that came to her house were such dopey flops I couldn't stand it.  That old guy she was sleeping with could've been her grandfather.  What a joke, man.  The attack and rape scenes were pretty physical, brutal and believable, though.  Gotta admit that.  The blue lightning ruined any authenticity, and the freezing of the creature in the end was just lame.  Her friends were kind of stooges, too.  The 2 stars are for the scenes when she was getting attacked and the one where she was violated while she slept.  By the way, who sleeps through sex?  This was a bad movie based on the story of some west coast crackpot who needed attention. Get The Exorcist or Poltergeist and forget this one.  Felt I had to warn potential buyers, as all the reviews on this are positive for some inexplicable reason.  Be honest and be discriminating.  Worth the price if the price is just a few bucks.  Would have enjoyed a scene where The Entity went after Ron Silver 
  I judge this smarmy mash to be about 75% Garcia Marquez and 25% Jorge Amado.  Summary-  Man bad.  Man dumb.  Man favorite profession- likable but stupid father, unlikable rapist fascist father, parasite, pedophile, one dimensional campasino, crazed priest...  Woman good.  Woman smart.  Woman nurturing.  Woman magical, deep, loving, tolerant, ...ad nauseam.  Subplot-  Capitalism evil.  Socialism good.  The only thing more depressing than contemplating the popularity of this novel is thinking about all the money Allende made from this.  
 Get the other volume - The Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis Collection.  This current "Still Laughing" cuts out all the songs, the quality is poorer, and of all incredibly stupid things to do, the morons who put this out have the title of the collection on the bottom right-hand of the screen, large, ALL THROUGH THE DVDs.  Yes, it is VERY distracting.  Boycott this 
 After the disappointment of the third episode it was with some apprehension that I approached the fourth.  Plot construction still seems to be the major weakness of Ms Hamilton's novels -it may be that she is simply not interested in it- but here at least we have sort of a story that begins at the beginning and kind of ends at the end, leaving nonetheless some open threads probably to be developped in following episodes. The mistery element is not that important, the privilege belonging to the characters' interaction which could be fine but is not.  Anita and her co-stars were perfectly rounded in the first episode and do not seem to experience any further maturation in the course of the four novels: take Anita's relationship with Jean Claude: we know right from the start that she is attracted to him and at the same time repelled by his being undead. Ms Hamilton continues to set confrontations among the two, fairly charged with sexual tension, but nothing new really happens, they are motionless and unchanging. This can be true in real life, I have known people who keep on emotionally butchering one another always returning to square one but, unless we are faced with a one volume masterpiece, this is hardly an interesting situation prolonged during four different novels. I even felt slightly irritated by Anita and Jean Claude rather childish behaviour and more so by the author's lack of creativity.  The only device Ms Hamilton is capable of is introducing new characters, but this may make the scene more colourful but hardly more interesting. Not to mention that, after slaying a million year old vampire one would expect Anita to get rid of a silly 200 y.o. Gretchen with a well shot silver bullet. This leads me to discuss another problem: there is no real sense of growing powers in Anita's character. Had she been able to kill the first villain out of sheer luck there could be a sense of growing self assurance facing ever stronger foes. There is not. She is perforce alternating moments when she is a real butch to others when she is nearly helpless. This is not believable.  What else? Oh yeah, in this volume we have a more pronounced sexual charge, but stop the yippees: hear hear Anita is not only a believer, therefore loathe of doing casual sex, but she was also hurt when younger therefore afraid of being hurt again. Once again this could be a nice endearing touch but the author wastes it with a rather shabby handling of the issue.  All above notwithstanding the fourth episode can still be fun for most readers -it was for me- but set aside any hope of having much more than that: simple, rather cheap fun 
 On LP and recently purchased it on CD only to realise why I don't listen to it its Flat. Don't get me wrong I love Dylans music, he is the only musician whose's concert I went to In good old Sydney in 1977 I think. His singing is as good as any the notes are clear but is it missing that range of feeling and expression that he can produce. He is putting his soul into the album instead of giving to the audience. Slow Train Coming and The Times They Are a Changing, are my all time favourite albums. 
 'We are poor, because they are rich'. This book is the bible of the perfect latin american idio 
 I had the discomfort of interviewing Ms. Dickerson for two hours after ATTEMPTING to get through her book.  I couldn't get through it sequentially and was forced to pick it up, randomly read a section until I couldn't stomache it any more.  What a waste of a higher education.  I think that the widespread incidence of child abuse can show up much later in life and leave us with adults with extensively damaged psyche.  I alternatively feel sorry for this damaged little girl in a woman's body and outraged that she would lease her blackness to those who would publish a peice of ethnic slander like "The End of Blackness."  I regard Ms. Dickerson to be somewhat schizophrenic...but I doubt that it is her fault.  This is a classic case of both "post-enslavement traumatic syndrome" and the "Stockholm syndrome. 
 When I saw this DVD- I just had to get it, because my husband and I remembered how hilarious that one sketch was - the one where he pretends to be a white man.  But after seeing it again after all these years, I must say that our society has "outgrown" its humor.  It just isn't as funny because we've all grown to accept much edgier comedy, with the likes of Dave Chapelle, Carlos Mencia, etc.  It still was amusing and brought back good memories from back in the day, but it just wasn't as hilariously shocking as it once was 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 I flipped through this book, but read their advice on traffic cycling with care.  It's just plain shoddy, and could get someone killed.  For example, theygive an absurdly complicated scheme for making left turns on multiple lane roads. I could hardly make heads or tails of it, and I've been commuting, racing, and riding recreationally for 15 years!  The best I could figure, they have left turning cyclists turning across the path of straight through motorists, which is both illegal and dangerous, instead of properly merging over to the left turn lane 
 I was disappointed in this book, had I not been on a coast-coast flight I would not have finished it.  The author could not keep track of whether his characters had their footwear on or off, among other problems.  The two main characters could not between them fight their way out of a wet paper bag if decision making were part of the process.  Watching them do stuipid things repeatedly for the sake of the plot became very trying.  It's too bad, the universe is interesting.  
 I'm learning Latin on my own using Wheelock's Latin and also got this workbook to have additional exercises to do.  I sent an email to the publisher to get an username and password to get access to the answers for this workbook.  They emailed me back saying they will only give it to educators.  Using a book in any self-teaching endeaver, one needs to have the answers to exercises for the book for it to be worth anything.  This is true no matter what subject matter - Latin, physics, or whatever.  So buying this workbook is a total waste of money 
 As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever. I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it.  The most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle "An Integrated Approach to Security in the Organization." The book not only lacks effective security integration techniques, it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration. 
 My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very "history lesson-ish") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, "So what?". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author. 
 Great! Karen Zelan writes a sensitive book about working with autistic children. Here's my rage and despair about this book. Zelan worked for years with Bruno Bettelheim. She co-authored books with him. And she witnessed his terrible abuse against mentally ill children at the Orthogenic School where she once worked. Many of the autistic children she knew lived at this school. Why did Zelan not report any of this abuse? Because of her silence and the silence of many others, young children, teens and young adults were constantly beaten and shamed in Bettelheim's "House of Horrors" for over 30 years. And children were beaten with fists and belts, smacked repeatedly in the face and told horrible things. It was all common knowledge if you worked there. So Karen Zelan cannot say she knew nothing of such things.  Read books like Richard Pollak's, "The Creation of Dr. B." or Stephen Eliot's, "Not the Thing I Was" or Jacqui Sanders' chapter on discipline in "A Greenhouse of the Mind", if you just can't believe it. Why should Zelan be allowed to benefit from writing this book about love and acceptance of autistic childen when she 1)did nothing to stop the abuse against autistic as well as mentally ill and traumatized children while she witnessed it and 2) has done nothing to make amends for her silence by now speaking out about the abuse and the legacy of silence.  How can she even live with such hypocrisy in her soul. Because of her silence and the silence of others, I was beaten and shamed for being confused and terrified. And I resent the hypocrisy of her being the sensitive autism guru when she seems to have had no problem watching disturbed children get beaten 
 With so many other decent study Bibles out there, there is not really a good reason to get this one.  Really the only reason is if you want one that includes the Apocrypha (though the New Annotated Oxford NRSV is probably better).  Format issues: The typeface is light and difficult to read.  I don't know if it comes in better binding, but the hardcover format I used was not as comfortable and attractive as most leather Bibles.  Content:  The notes are less extensive than some other study Bibles (for example, NIV Study Bible) and are mostly just annotations.  The contributors have all decided against the validity of much of what the Bible reports and advocates. They are far too critical, and as a result the usefulness of this book is diminished. Unlike, say the NIV Study Bible or the Reformation Study Bible, the HarperCollins Bible would not be very helpful for personal devotionals, small group studies, etc.  It spills too much ink trying to show how the Bible isn't really accurate and trustworthy before the user can start trying to make application to their life. Highly skeptical Biblical criticism has its place, but for a study Bible it seriously handicaps the work 
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 What staggering chain reaction of catastrophes allowed Ann Coulter to command a pencil?   Clearly, an ego as huge and wantonly abrasive as hers belongs on daytime TV or talk radio.  She's ignorant, arrogant, and utterly vicious.  It hurts the conservatives to have someone like this on their side.  This book should have been called "Who Needs Facts?"  There isn't a single fact in this book.  I repeat, NOT ONE SINGLE FACT.  Coming up with moderately clever ways of stretching any viewpoint other than her own into an artless caricature of itself, then smugly and ruthlessly slamming everyone who holds that viewpoint, is much more fun (and more satisfying) than doing research.  Coulter doesn't need facts.  After all, if anyone asks her why liberals are evil, she can just tell them it's because God said so.  Let me assert that I am not a liberal only here to take potshots at a well-known conservative.  I am in the middle of the political road.  My view is that both extremes are usually wrong.  As an example, one of the guys in my workplace is the stereotypical angry young liberal: loud, opinionated, arrogant, abrasive, and ready to lay every problem in the civilized world at the feet of our current conservative President, GW Bush.  Obviously, there are things wrong out there that have nothing to do with President Bush, but you just can't tell this guy that.  As far as he's concerned, conservatives have ruined this country.  Ann Coulter is the same thing only backwards.  She would have you believe all liberals are boorish, unshaven, tree-hugging hooligans. They bathe in the blood of murdered babies. They want everyone else to have to bathe in the blood of murdered babies. They only stop short of international terrorism because they lack the ability to organize.  You think I'm exaggerating?  I'm not.  Coulter says things about liberals that I wouldn't say about Nazis (a group which, incidentally, she compares liberals to in several places).  This book entwines ignorance, invective, and outright fabrication into a wretched, half-congealed mess, and then presents it as "the truth".  It's not her ignorance that offends me.  It's her smug sense of superiority I can't stand.  I read a lot: I've got three large bookcases, all full, and this is the worst excuse for a book I can remember ever reading.    If you: are a hardcore conservative; are a hardcore Christian; are a fan of opinion in its most distilled and rarefied form; have a room-temperature IQ;  then this is your book.    Everyone else, stay away. 
 I don't know why this is, but when I put on the Dale Sr. shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls 
 From a first-time macroeconomic student's point of view, this book sucked. The glossary was very poor making it troublesome to look up unfamiliar terms. Each chapter makes frequent reference to charts and graphs that are located several pages away, causing you to have to shuffle back and forth between pages, trying to decipher difficult new concepts. This book also assumes some prior knowledge of economic concepts, and moves very quickly through progressively more complex material. Thumbs down from a new student's perspective 
 I like to find an author and read all their books, not necessarily in order. I find that I get a great liking/disliking for them and decide if I will continue. I found CC's books to be good with the first FBI book I read with Dane Carver. It was good. Damsel in distress and FBI agent friend falls in love with her and they marry all live happily ever after. Then there is the one with the detective, Ben. Guess what,  he falls in love with the damsel in distress and they get married. Then there is Mac and Quinlan, both FBI agent friends of Savich/Sherlock - they too fall madly in love with the women they are protecting/investigating and get married and live happily ever after. Now I am all for a nice romantic twist in a book but it happens in EVERY one. Don't forget the MAZE where Savich and Sherlock fall in love. I did not dislike any of those books but it did get a bit mundane when I started seeing the same outline for the plot there. A lot of the same use of dialogue and words starting popping off the page at me. Just not a lot of new material to hold the interest.   HEMLOCK BAY was just too much to take. I like the characters Savich and Sherlock - they are certainly written as superagents and superparents. I even liked Lily and Simon in this one. BUT and here the big BUT, the plot! It was just too winding, too unrealistic (not even counting the unexplained supernatural things) and just too far fetched. I was disappointed with this read. Will I read more? Well I have one more of the FBI series here to finish the whole set so yes I will. I will not recommend many of them to friends. I think CC had a great thing going and just went off on a tangent as many of the best selling authors do such as Cornwell (was my favorite until the last few books become recipe plots as well), Grafton (who I had to read five to confirm they were as bad as I had thought on the first one) and Patterson (yes even the great one has some that were actual groaners).  I read a lot - a book every day and a half is what it works out to so I buy several at one time. I just found this to be a waste of my time and very depressing that a best selling author would consider this to be up to par. The recipe is now old and needs perked up. Time to change the ingredients and spice it up 
 A PRINCESS AND 8 SAMURAIS BATTLE THE HIKIMA CLAN. THE MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD SWORDFIGHTS, BUT THE MOVIE'S ALSO TOO LONG, TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES, AND IT'S JUST A TRIAL TO SIT THROUGH AT TIMES!NOT TO MENTION, THE DUBBING IS HORRENDOUS. MARTIAL ARTS FANS SHOULD SKIP THIS ONE. THERE'S MUCH BETTER MOVIES OUT THERE THAN THIS 
 The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters "Guard One" just shows you don't even try to care. The plot is so hair-brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache -- I just learned, to my horror, that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times. I'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise, but it's been ruined forever by... this. Somewhere, Baby Jesus is crying 
 I purchased the updated, 3rd edition recently and anyone who can actually understand the contents and retain the information, my hat is off to you. I have been a personal trainer for over 7 years and thought this book would supply me with some extra knowledge. Was I wrong. Way too technical. Way too many references and studies with many times contradicting themselves. Very non user friendly. I have read paragraphs to co-workers who are more advanced than me and even they shook their heads. DO NOT BUY if you are looking to advance your personal training skills and knowledge. I have passed several certifications and consider myself fairly knowledgable, but this book left me scratching my head and saying WHAT???? 
 I was looking forward to purchasing another Beth Orton album. Central Reservation and Pass In Time are marvelous. Imagine my dismay when I popped the CD into my lovely two-channel high end system to hear what amounts to MP3 quality sound. Simply awful. Move the production back to England. The people in New York obviously don't know what they're doing. 
 I couldn't get past chapter 5, and that was after skipping through some of the earlier chapters. Dull descriptions, and too many of them, dominate the writing. Characters were about as exciting as bricks. Plot development--ha! This is a mystery novel: why isn't the plot going anywhere?  And lest I forget, grammatical errors abound in this novel. Tip for you, Nevada: something is not "comprised of" things, things comprise a larger object. And Yosemite being at the same *longitude* as Mississippi? Pleaaase! Give me a break, it's barely at the same lattitude; Yosemite is 225 miles north of the very northern tip of Mississippi, and Mississippi is 300 miles long N to S. Hey Barr, are you sure you weren't smoking that dope when you wrote this?  Apparently (thank you other reviews), the punchline is that a plane full of dope has crashed in the mountains and people are swarming over each other to get at it. Big whoop. Come out to LA and you can see drug dramas for real--murder, intrigue, corruption and all.  Do something useful with your time: find a good Sherlock Holmes novel 
 This is my first review mainly because it's the only one where I found my perspective to be dramatically different than the other reviewers.  I bought the audio version based on the reviews I read on line and was looking forward to reading a new author.  What I found is a book that is full of cliches and choppy dialogue.  Although it's a very quick read I found myself frustrated with the ridiculous dialogue and characters that failed to keep my interest.  I must confess that I did find myself laughing out loud at some of the very bad cliches.  I will qualify my review by stating that this was an audiobook and I found the reader to be very poor, using accents for different characters that were wildly exaggerated.  It could be the reader's characterization that amplified the poor writing.  Needless to say I will not be reading any other Swain books 
 I was pretty dissapointed with this book.  All the "inside information" has been pretty much common knowledge.  Although "taking sides" is pretty much a natural in doing Beatles books, the author seems particularly anti Paul/Linda.   It seemed to me the author's main interest wasn't even the Beatles, but Hare Krishna. I'd suggest "Magical Mystery Tours, My Life With the Beatles" by Tony Bramwell.  It was a much more detailed and enjoyable read 
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it 
 Scott, working with Andre de Toth, who worked with him in Stranger Wore A Gun, finds himself in a film that does not stack up against the Budd Boetticher Western he made around the same period.  Scott plays a rancher in a range war against a bigger, powerful rancher, who has married the woman Scott loves. Scott tries to refrain from violence, but when the other rancher hires gunmen to kill Scott, Scott has to defend himself.  Westerns often feature a plot that has been done many times before, but are distinguished by great writing, great action, and great performances, and this film features none of these things. It is great that this film has been released on DVD, but it will not be remembered as one of Scott's better films 
 If you want real logos and business sign designs, forget it! If you want 'upscale chic modernistic' european disco artwork-then probably that's what this is! Nothing from North America-very limited in color usage, etc. Bulk of what we looked through was no different than the unused CD's of 'artwork' we got with an old 100,000 clipart design set! I would NOT recommend this to anyone thinking this will give them good layout and design ideas to show USA customers...unless they are opening a modernistic computer age boutique.. 
 I thought since this was form the AAP that it would be the best reference. Not even close. It is difficult to read because it is in 6pt type. It looks like they just shrunk down the original Hard copy and tried to size it to a paperback. As a result, the text is tiny and only fills up 2/3 of the page! The book measures 6 X 9, but the reading area is 4 1/2 X 6 1/4!!It does not look at all like what you see when you take a peek on the website. The illustrations are very few and of poor quality. The information is from 1997. There was a LOT missing, especially since there have been advances in pediatrics in the last 8 years. The information is not very helpful as far as relieving symptoms, and is geared toward older children. There are so many references out there today that are MUCH better than this book. This is the first time I have EVER returned a book. I am extrememly disappointed. Please continue to browse - there are a lot of choices out there that are more complete and better organized than this. 
 Another Reggae Gold with nothing but old songs.  Every song on the CD is over a year old.  Come on VP give us somethig fresh and new.     This formula is old, stale and boring.  For Reggae fans who like hot, fresh new music I recommend you check out '18 Karat Reggae Gold' it is a lot hotter.  Reggae Gold is like stale bread, 18 Karat Reggae Gold is hot fresh bread from the oven 
 This book is more for those who already have a working knowledge of the field of spinal manipulation. I was very disappointed within minutes of opening the cover. I thought "Made Simple" meant just that 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 While my tears flowed in several places throughout Souls Raised from the Dead, I found myself dry-eyed and skeptical at the end. Betts' novel of a girl on the cusp of adolescence diagnosed with kidney disease and  surrounded by a myriad of colorful adult figures could have been so much  more than the plot-driven surface treatment she gave the characters. Mary  Grace Thompson suffers from kidney failure, but Betts never tells the  reader what that involves. Only as the reader turns the pages do the stages  of dietary restrictions, dialysis, increased medications, and hope for a  donor become clear as the next steps. Betts' implied medical horror is only  a shadow compared to the black and white truth of medical reality. I would  have been happier knowing the clinical details; however, the in's and out's  of kidney failure were not the focus of this book. And therein lies my  biggest disappointment with Souls Raised from the Dead. The book's focus  was the cliched characters and their relationships--stoic father and  prickly, loving, daughter; selfish irresponsible ex-wife and two current  girl-friends with different needs and wants; self-righteous grandparents  and "white trash" grandparents who have a good heart where Mary  is concerned. Betts did not delve into their personalities enough to make  me emphathize with them. The dialogue was stilted, though some of the  one-sentence descriptions were poigniant. Betts describes Mary Thompson's  thoughts through the stages of her illness with clarity, though Betts never  shows how Mary's feelings of isolation, denial and detachedness affect her  relationships with her father or grandparents. Betts also delved into the  character of Tacey Thompson, Mary's paternal grandmother, and her struggle  with a faith contradicted by reality. Initially, I was prepared for a  wrenching story, but by the end of the book, I was annoyed with the  predictable plot and could easily visualize this as a made-for-TV movie 
 We've had our skillet a few months and now the nonstick coating is peeling off like crazy.  What a waste of money and natural resources.  It also makes me concerned about toxic substances that we might have been ingesting all this time.  Terrible product.  They really should offer a recall.  It's a good design idea.  They should offer it with a cast iron pan 
 Sting (of whom I think very well as a musician in his own terms) has given a step into the early baroque-lute-song reperoire of great composer John Dowland... Too bad for him. There are plenty of better choices (almost everyone that exists) for this music... I belive most of the people who will buy and listen this CD do not have any idea of how this music must be sung., and most of them must be fans of the singer... Well, good for them because they will have the opportunity to hear a great composer and some of the most touching music per voice and lute... but ror the rest of us... this cd is just a fiasco 
 I found a supposedly "New remastered edition" of Sade's "Diamond Life" on sale for less than 10 bucks. OOPS! Great mistake! When I tried to return it, the CD store was already out of business, and the copy is one issued in the Netherlands which is marked INTO THE BOOKLET as "2000 Digital Remastered Version". The whole album HAS BEEN RE-RECORDED with new arrangements! The digital sound is quite good, but the new arrangements made for 'Smooth Operator' REALLY SUCKS!! 
 I was excited to read this book, as I have often thought about subscribing to the IBD (I've picked it up & read it several times at the library).  So I bought this book to try it out. I've lost all respect for this author & the IBD. Here are just a few of the problems:  (1) Frankly, it doesn't work: I picked 10 stocks & applied the CAN SLIM formula, and the portfolio did worse than my S&P 500 index fund.  (2) The method is deeply flawed: First he gives the steps to CAN SLIM, which is mostly common sense. "Increased trading activity indicates a stock may go up or down in the near future."  Duh. Next, he says the formula might not work in a Bull or Bear Market (which explains why my portfolio didn't work). Then, if you follow a footnote, you will read that it might not work in a Flat market either. !!! THEN he lists all these other caveats where the formula might not work. Excuse me? Just under what circumstance will this formula work? Full moon, on an even numbered month & odd numbered day, while sitting under a Sycamore tree? This is very fuzzy logic.  (3) It's terribly complicated: even if it did work, the daily research and effort to make your picks is not worth the payoff. There are much better books & newsletters out there, that make quarterly & annual recommendations that require much less research AND they pay off better. Try Bob Brinker's Marketimer, the book Dividends Don't Lie, or Adding to Your Financial Portfolio... by Christensen, et al.  (4) It's politically motivated (and naive): This guy actually thinks that Bush's economic policy is solid? It's difficult to find even a single Republican in the Congress who sincerely believes that a $6 trillion debt is a good idea. But William O'Neil not only believes Bush's overspending is a terrific idea, he applauds him for it & lobbies for Bush's economic policies. Amazing.   And, if you follow this advice, you too may one day be in debt by $6 trillion.  Bottom line: look elsewhere. I had thought Investors Business Daily was a reputable publication, but now I know better. I don't know how the IBD manages to stay in business with this horribly simplistic advise 
 When I purchased the candy bar I thought I was I was buying the real Cadbury from England but to my mistake it turned out to be the same candy I can buy in any store. Can you belive I had it shiped to my house 
 As readers, people should always be careful about the way they write a review of a book such as this: it is not in any way shape or form a representation of "life in Brazil."  It is a representation of what life in some, I repeat, some poorer areas of Brazil can be like... but even so, being originally from Brazil and having traveled in my country, I can give anyone a million examples of poor or people who live under the poverty line, who are loving, decent, clean, concerned with the well-being and protection of others first before their own.  I despise it when people file anything under the "generalization" category about other countries, and Brazil seems to always get a bad wrap in this sense.  Brazil is an amazing country, culturally rich and diverse, geographically gorgeous and varied, and when speaking of a country with 186+ million inhabitants, how can anyone generalize under any one specific term about this or that factor?  Not all mothers -- by a very very long stretch -- in Brazil fit the mode portrayed in "Death without weeping," and hope to have made that absolutely clear here: misinformation of this kind is absurd, and using the subhead "The Violence in Everyday Brazil" even more irreponsible from such a noted author 
 Wow.  I read this book a few days ago, and definitely have my own opinion on it.  I thought I would come here and see what other folks are saying, and I'm not altogether surprised.  The first thing that continually surprises me when I read a poorly written book is how so many people can think it is, in fact, well-written, if not even brilliant.  There is, of course, no accounting for taste.    What disturbs me more than the inability of people to recognize both poor writing and equally poor scholarship (which suggests a lack in either education or practice) is how people can urge others to have a balanced view on a subject when they quite obviously could not be more imbalanced in their own views.  I urge those of you that see Bush as a righteous man to please "read around."  There are, obviously, dozens of books about this man and his actions that touch on topics that books like God and George W. Bush will not even acknowlege, much less discuss, defend, or justify.  To ignore these other sources of information is to be possibly tragically misinformed.  While I do not doubt that many of the previous reviews come from good and intelligent people, I am forced to wonder how they can support a man who performs acts, or at least allows them to be performed, that are every bit as vile as that which he claims to oppose.  Read other books and you will see.   One subject that always makes me wince is the labeling of those fighting our soldiers as evil.  I am not supporting them or denouncing our own, but merely urging all of us to recognize the humanity of others.  Labeling a people as evil undermines their humanity and suggests that they do not have good reasons to be fighting, but that they fight simply to overcome those who "love freedom."  This is from  page 114 of this very book, (a quote from Phyllis Wheatley) "In every human breast, God has implanted a principle which we call love of freedom."  Here's a 'revolutionary' thought: Everybody loves and wants freedom.  If people are fighting they are fighting for freedom, we simply must ask one question: Freedom from what?  Read around and see for yourself if you can answer such a question.  Also, see if you can discover, honestly and objectively, the freedoms that we are currently fighting for.  Another huge bother for me in this book is that Kengor refers to Texas as the largest state in the nation.  It's difficult to take the rest of his scholarship seriously when he makes such a statement.  Another horrific, to my mind, thought is that Bush, and lots of his followers, truly believes that God wants him to be president.  A megalomaniacal zealot in charge of a cadre of nukes with an "I'm on a mission from God" world view scares the hell out of me. 
 I do not recomend this book to anyone, it paints a portrait of Tina Turner  quite opossite of who she really is. It tries to tell you that Tina Turner  is selfish and rude, while in reality she is just about the nicest person I  have had the pleasure to meet. This book is also full of mistakes about  Tina's life, her wigs, her tours, her temper, ect................... Don't  waste your money on this title!! 
 I purchased this product to share my DVI monitor and Logitech Bluetooth keyboard/mouse between my two main machines - the exact use promoted by the manufacturer.  I successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping, but am extremely disappointed with the DVI video at 1600 by 1200 (severe streaking and noise), and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise.  BTW, I am using Belkin KVM cables.  Don't even THINK about purchasing this unit 
 This book, though purporting to expose abuses of the legislative process in the House, is lacking in a number of areas.  Its substance suffers from an obvious rush to get to print prior to the 2006 midterm elections.  It could easily have been written as a less profitable and more concise essay.  There is very little history of the Houses's storied past.  The book is best when it differentiates between abuses of the Democrats in the majority in the past, and the Republicans in their 12 year reign.  The Medicare prescription drug vote stands out.  That vote, however, does not stand out as much as the author's naivete in their own dealings with Congress.  While working on a House study group, formed by the Democrats to help improve the operation of the House, the authors actually inserted in the report that the Democratic house leadership was "arrogant."  The authors then appear to be taken aback that they were called to a meeting of House chairmen who didn't appreciate that characterization of their leadership.  Regardless of whether true or not, their characterization of the leadership not only could have been more diplomatically stated, it needn't have been stated at all. Such naivete  raises the question as to how effective the authors can actually be in their declared mission to fix a broken branch.  This is the kind of political book all too often found in the public domain these days.  It was rushed to print to address a contemparary issue that will fade into history.  it won't even meet President Bush's criterion as a footnote.  It will not serve as a good primary source for historians.    It also spends too much of its time in discussing the authors's self-laudatory attempts to "reform" Congress.  These days self-promotion seems to be required material for books whose existence drifts between contemporary journalism, history, and "expert" commentary 
 There is absolutely not one word of substance in this book.  There's not all that much about the warriors and what there is so ridiculous that one is inclined to suspect that the author is putting us on.  The tabloids at the supermarket checkout counter have more substance than this nonsense 
 I knew there were two aliens/UFO camps: those who believe we're being visited by aliens, and those who don't believe we are. I hadn't realised there was a third camp: those who believe these "aliens" are demons. For those willing to swallow the existence of demons in the first place, I guess this is great news for them.  For a rational treatment of the alien abduction phenomenon in modern society, read "Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens" by Susan A. Clancy, and of course Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World" 
 This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.  
 Danielle Steel has done it once again. Written a book that must have taken her all of one day. I was really disappointed after Summer in St. Tropez, but thought after a break from her books I'd try again. Sorry I wasted my time. This book is SO repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. The story line seems to drag on forever. If Steel's goal is to "dumb" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. This book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. Don't waste your time 
 I hate high maintence women they never want to work and earn their own money like men are suppose to buy them gifts for free. This book gives New York women a bad name like Jennifer Belle it's no wonder she went threw some hard times cause she's just a golddiger. I call her trash 
 This book is a complete farce.  Gee, trained as a theoretical linguist, is clearly treading in foreign territory, attempting to theorize about a phenomenon that he can barely even grasp.  Of course video games are "learning machines" that must be able to teach gameplay in order to succeed.  Of course video games qualify as "semiotic domains," and that some cognitive skills are practiced in their mastery.  But there is no evidence to support Gee's jump to conclude that the practice and mastery of the semiotic domains of video games has anything to do with the practice and mastery of complex academic semiotic domains.  Video games represent a good model for learning insofar as learning is successfully integrated with reward, but there is no reason to believe that more substantive forms of learning could possibly mimic these rapid-fire reward structures.  If anything, the near-constant adrenaline rushes of video game "learning" are likely at complete odds with most other forms of learning, and certainly with reading, which cannot possibly provide this form of stimulation.  Gee has become a patriarch of sorts to the legions of gamers and game developers who long for an intellectual justification for their algorithmic addictions.  Read this book if you are interested, but try to remain critical.  The temptation to believe may be great, but the man's logic simply doesn't add up 
 Please, you guys. Stop recording new CD's. We have plenty of Matheney CD's. The music world is flooded with CD's that will never be as great as the Brandenburg Concertoes by Bach. Matheney's music has grown stale like moldy bread. The trouble with jazz is that it's just finger food for people with enormous egos. We don't need another Matheney - whomever duo CD. Go and buy the music for 18 musicians by steve reich. Now that's stunning music. All of my pat matheney cd's have a layer of dust because I don't play them anymore. Give up, Pat. Try something else. YOu've left your legacy back in the 70's. Give up 
 I did not like this audio book.  Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story. In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again. It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.  It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again. 
 On the Far Side of the Mountain is about Sam Gribley, who lives on the Catskill Mountains. He eventually is also burdened with his sister living there, and must leave the safety of the mountain to save her with his friend Bando.  This book has some action and adventure, but not enough for my taste. I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one. 
 You won't find the claustrophobic genius of the book.  You won't even find a linear account of the storyline.  You will find watchable trash 
 As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves.  The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.  It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close.  Please don't waste your time with this film 
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 Sheila Fitzpatrick has written that the total number of those murdered by the Soviets is in the "low hundreds of thousands."  In other words, she is a crank. There are numerous books out debunking Fitzpatrick and her fellow apologists for Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Yale University's "Annals of Communism" series is a good place to start.   "In Denial: Historians, Communism & Espionage" by John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr is an excellent read on how Fitzpatrick and other academics distort facts and lie through omission to cover up the atrocities of Lenin, Zinoviev, Radek, Trotsky, Stalin et al.   Fifteen years ago, Fitzpatrick's apologies for a regime which murdered over 20 million of its own citizens could have been (weakly) defended. Now that the Soviet archives have been opened and we have testimony from those involved in the regime, her book is simply inexusable.   Read "A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia"  by Alexander N. Yakovlev and Anthony Austin.  Yakovlev was the architect of perestroika. He was a communist. He had access to documents western researchers have not yet seen. Yakovlev details how the regime was a criminal organization from its founding. It never had the support Fitzpatrick claims it did.       
 As a distinguished historian of ancient science, Francesca Rochberg remarked, do we need another book on the Medici?  I think not 
      The funny thing about reading these reviews is that everyone focuses on the break in at the end.  Even many pages before, all the monsters and burglars have guns and guns are a part of the "pictures".  The story line could have been cute---My husband is the biggest advocate of gun ownership and has quite a collection, however the very first thing you teach a child is never ever to point even a toy gun at anyone, especially their head.  The idea of a child watching their mother being held with a gun to her head and threatened to blow her brains out, not once but twice is totally not permissable.  Not even if you are talking about a big doggie and his bad manners!  Guns have no place on page illustrations of a child's book!! 
 Ok, let me say one thing first: I have yet to finish the novel.  I don't know that I will.  So can I really write a fair, balanced review? No.  But I couldn't keep reading without saying a few things about the book.  First off, someone should have edited this book.  I've yet to encounter the typos mentioned in other reviews, but the author tends to drone on and on about things I couldn't care less about.  Second, where in the world are these people from?  The actions of the two main characters are so superficial and staged that it made me lose interest almost immediately.  Scott even thinks to himself several times that he doesn't like Ryan, but continues to hang out with him because he's so cute.  Next thing you know, he's playing his flute for him in a completely ridiculous scene that had me groaning out loud.  And the camping trip....I mean, come on.  Let us in on a real story, with believable actions, not where the two characters seem to be merely drifting through a string of set pieces that don't make sense.  Third...ah heck, I'm not even going to get started on the corny dialogue.  Let's just say I hate that I spent money on something and I can't bring myself to get through it.  But sheesh.  I compare this to Common Sons a little, where the characters sometimes behaved and said things that didn't seem real.  The only difference is, with Common Sons, the two main characters were at least interesting enough to care about.  They held that novel together even during its hard to swallow parts.  This one simply falls apart page after page.  
 You're led to believe that these are the full-length hits when you play them, but DONT BE FOOLED!!  They are chopped up shortened versions of the original hits!!  FAME by David Bowie has about 2 min taken out, and the great guitar riff at the end of the Lynard Skynard "Freebird" tune is chopped off at the end . .A RIP OFF!! 
 I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like "Desert Heat." If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away 
 The performance seemed great, but I couldn't stand how choppy the editing was.  In the first concert, the camera angle changes every 3 seconds or less.  I am not exaggerating.  This made it really difficult for me to enjoy.    
 ...and then bogs down something awful. Great start--snappy dialogue (and pieces of that snap are scattered throughout the book so you know the guy's smart).  But the problem is that after a rock solid hardboiled start, things get way too complicated to really make this hardboiled pulp fiction. It winds up being a puzzle mystery, NOT a tough crime novel--puzzle mysteries are the kind that all those smart mystery writers wrote, and still write. They're in their own league--not hardboiled, not cozy. Smart, but the novels always start with a murder and then some genius woman or man figures out how all the pieces fit together.  So, yes, there is a murder. There are a couple of babes. But they don't count for much in the story; they're a diversion that the author seems to have thrown in to try to make this appear to be a hardboiled novel. Didn't work.  Hardboiled fiction is about base instincts and while that is certainly the motivating factors for the events in the novel, in no way could this be considered hardboiled fiction because the delivery is just too cerebral. Hardboiled fiction is about base instinct, but delivered in a style that matches those instincts--that's pulp. And just because something's called pulp doesn't mean it's bad. Not at all. Good pulp is great reading. For example, read Dan Marlowe for GREAT hardboiled fiction. Or Dashiell Hammett, especially Red Harvest which remains one of my absolute favorite hardboiled novels, written in 1929!!  Top of the Heap, as one reviewer pointed out here, has a title that is completely obscure. There's no way of figuring out what it refers to. The cover blurb says something about "She made her way to the top...", or something, but no woman in the novel is a main character. That honor belongs to Donald Lam, half of the Lam and Cool Detective Agency; the other half is a blustering, ultra-tough woman, Bertha Cool, who cusses out her partner Lam for blowing money.  By the time the reader gets to the end of the novel, the last 15 pages or so are pure explication and go on and on and on about how this person did this and that person did that and so on, and so forth, neatly fitting all the pieces of the puzzle together. To be blunt, this was a real drag to read.   I recommend The Name of the Game is Death by Dan Marlowe, the aforementioned Red Harvest by Hammett, and a whole lot of stuff by Jim Thompson, David Goodis, and a few other guys--as well as Ride the Pink Horse by Dorothy Hughes, one of the best hardboiled novels ever. But Top of the Heap is just too smart for its own good to be counted as hardboiled.  Hard Case Crime is putting out a brand new original novel by Stephen King in October 2005. Here's hoping that will be more hardboiled than this one 
 This book illustrates the difference between important and merely influential. It virtually invented the vague/portentious prose style that signifies boredom and alienation, and appeared as late as 1996 on the liner notes of Rage Against the Machine's "Evil Empire".  But it isn't very good. The dimestore existentialism aged, badly. Didion's spare writing now seems phony and juvenile. The same characters experiencing the same emotions have been rehashed so many times, often in superior forms, that what was innovative in the seventies doesn't really cut it anymore. Not that it was very original in its time, coming as it did after thirty years of Sartre and ten of Antonioni. Not to mention Horace McCoy's terrific 1935 novel "They Shoot Horses Don't They", popularized in a Hollywood film (coincidentally?) only a year before "Play It"'s publication.  A minor footnote to a still-evolving trend 
 I've loved other Southern Living cookbooks and read some reviews that greatly overrated this book's appeal. I wasn't able to preview a copy at my library and was very unhappy with the results. Boring pedestrian recipes that might be quick and easy but look tasteless and boring. I was hoping for some quick innovative ideas but instead was presented with many recipes that involved mixing "a can of" with processed frozen foods. Yuck!!! Definitely not up to the usual standards of Southern Living 
 This blows. Vocals blow. Guitars blow. It just blows. Deal with it! 
 Peggy helped see the revolution through.  What she didn't tell us it was a revolution of the rich versus the poor and middle class.  Peggy and Ronnie should feel great in the fact that "the revolution" makes it so we either don't have health care or have terrible health care, but still have to pay high premiums for service which should be available to everyone.  That "the revolution" put many people out on the street and "the revolution" led to uncalled numerous deaths worldwide to benefit the wealthy.  May they rot in hell 
 This movie is only good for those that "love" Alyssa Milano.  Plot?  It isn't non-existent.  It DOES exist but it's a complete crap!  Period.  Just an excuse to show skin.  Regarding the DVD, it's a barebones one but picture and audio quality is as good as most New Line Cinema releases, anamorphic and stuff, plus it's the best release of the movie if we compare it with releases in other regions.  You won't be disappointed in that aspect 
 I am a 20 year user of several Remington products, but I must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver.  The Remington ES-1000 Utra Smooth Bump Control Shaver was designed to replace the original (BMS) Black Man's Shaver which was discountinued several years ago.  I recently purchased and used the ES-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance.  The ES-1000 performed so poorly that I had to use my BMS that I had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the ES-1000 shaver could not and did not remove.  The product should be called "Ultra poor with a sandpaper finish."  The product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet.  For anyone with curly hair problems, you may want to consider comparing this product against the Wahl 5-Star Series, Model # 8061.  I think you will find there is a major difference in the products 
 Social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study.  This book does it a disservice.  This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas.  You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.  Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book.  Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead 
 Kevin Trudeau leads his readers into believing they will get the solutions they are looking for but when the time for presenting them comes, he sends his readers to his website where they have to pay an outrageous membership fee. He condemns those who are out to make money at our expense then turns around does the same thing.  I give it two stars because there is some knowledge to be gained but no solution unless you are willing to pay.  A big disappointment 
 I couldn't get into the stories or the characters....  I like short stories and novellas, and was hoping for something in the vein of Ray Bradbury or Stephen King...or Robert Heinlein...  ...I found none of that in Gibson's "Burning Chrome".. 
 I prefer the book Art of Chainmail by Dylon Whyte. Available from The Art of Chainmail by Dylon Whyte website or Spider Chains website. In the book by Dylon Whyte, the illustrations are beautiful renderings from a 3D program, with great colour contrast that is easy to understand visually. The information and directions are clearly written and super easy to understand. The author is available by email and is very informative and helpful. It's probably the best book available on this subject. 
 This book is a mixed bag, with many pluses and minuses.  First of all, as it's one of the old O'Hara publications books, this was the first taste of Wing Chun (or Ving Tsun) that most of the "Black Belt Magazine crowd" ever got. Consequently, it finds some rather creative ways to demonstrate the basic concepts, which is good.  It also gives you an overview of the Wing Chun kicking techniques, which are often overlooked.  However, after attending even a single week of Wing Chun instruction with a competant teacher, you will never touch this book again.  As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, sil lum tao in this book is very poorly executed. What's more, the pictures were either taken at a slight angle or the author shows a callous disregard for the centerline, ignoring one of the fundamental principles of Wing Chun.  Also, most of the advanced wooden dummy exercises shown are completely worthless to the neophyte or hobbyist (you don't have the proper techniques down) except as background information.   Proper footwork and turning are not given their fair share, without which you are *NOT* doing Wing Chun....  All in all, you're better served finding a competant instructor than buying this book. It's good daydream material, but if you don't know Wing Chun, you won't learn it from this book.  (I also recommend "The Path to Wing Chun" by Samuel Kwok, for a more accurate representation of Sil Lum Tao 
 Whatever ills are in the world, it's all the fault of the corporations. That's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one-sided and totally non-objective movie. For example, instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work, they forget that these people's alternatives ARE EVEN WORSE and that's why they took that job in the first place!  These jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and, if they chose that job freely, it must be their BEST option, no matter how crazy it seems to us. As people's skills rise, as opportunities increase over time (by having MORE corporations and not less, to create more competition for these people's labor), and as the country becomes wealthier, these people's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact, the wages of the whole country on the average.  There are no shortcuts to his.  A famous story comes from Nepal where anti-child labor laws, at the urging of the UN, turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs, as sad as it may be, were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families.  It's a slow process, but all the industrialized nations went through that process.  Government-mandated "shortcuts" usually produce results which are even worse.  However, the results speak for themselves: in VERY short period of time, for example, HUNDRDS OF MILLIONS of people were lifted out of poverty in China, India and around the world thanks for the "evil" capalism & its corporations.  No other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in China and India alone.  Also, cost of living is very low there, so these pennies really can go a long way, don't measure it to the cost of living in the West.  What is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people? I guess to let people starve to death, then the makers of this movie don't have have anyting to complain about!?  Other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who's a psychopath.  A corpoartion is a legal entity yes, and may act like a separate "being" as far the law in concerned, but does a corporation have a nose, feet, stomach? Can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis? Of course, not, than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it??  Several of the main "spokepersons" in the movie, Chomsky, Michael Moore, Rifkin and others are renowned for their off-the-wall comments which frequently have NO basis in any kind of economics or reality.  To correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie, you'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are.  Throughout the whole movie, you're basically bombarded by one-sided arguments with VERY little of the other side presented, despite the director's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2 & 1/2, it's more like 80%-20%).  Just look at Chomsky's comments about how the consumers are so stupid, they don't realize that all the things they buy they don't really need. I mean we don't need fashionable clothes (hey, let's all dress as boring as Chomsky!), DVD players, or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun.  Who is the judge of what you REALLY need?  Chomsky, of course. He is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you don't. You're too stupid to know what you want, according to him. He says that you should do "more important things", like...perhaps studying lingistics (which he teaches but which very few care about).  The movie DOES make some correct and good observations, especially regarding polution, however, I'd say that 80% of the movie is factually and logically flawed. It's also FULL of economic fallacies. It's worth watching I guess, just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie.  Despite all the ranting in the movie, it fails to mention THE biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life.  For examples, how could a Government of Brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water! How could the U.S. government do so many things for private companies with public funds?  Just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies, forbid government corporate welfare of ANY kind, forbid subsidies to companies, cut the suffocating red tape and regulation (esp. in developing countries but in the West too), cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10% (and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing, give people all around the world a better life, increase competition, etc.)  If these and other governments (and not corporations') problems were eliminated, the vast majority of ALL the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away.  An interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile (spoken about with much admiration), people with NO understanding about economics, how the world really works and how to REALLY raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for. 
 Boring.  That is the first word that comes to mind after reading this book.  After the first 100 pages-all I could think about was how much I would like to shake Marsali senseless!  What a selfish little snot! And the  rest of her clan is not much better.  For Duncan to have been this supposed  brilliant military leader - he really did not show much forcefullness or  leadership in this book - seemed more bemused than anything else. There was  also very little passion between these two.  If I had been Duncan - I  probably would have thrown Marsali into the dungeon and tossed out the key!  There was also very little suspense and too much harping over Duncan's  past. Get over it already Duncan - the past is over with!  I would love to  read a novel with a real man in it - one who has had past difficulties, but  has come to terms with them and doesn't have to "deal with his  emotions" before he can love someone! Too much of a 90's guy - getting  in touch with his emotions - not enough historical authenticity!   How  about a real MAN for a change - and no - I'm not talking about the caveman  type! Needless to say - this will be the last of this author's books that I  read - especially since this was supposed to have been one of her best 
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 I had been given a slow cooker a while ago, but could never find good recipes for it.  When I thumbed through this book, the pictures and ingredients looked wonderful, so I bought it.  What a mistake!  These recipes could be made much faster and with the same amount of effort if I didn't even use my slow cooker! If I have to cook everything before I put it in the slow cooker, what exactly is the point? I could cook it using my stove and oven in less time with the same results and effort (something I have successfully tried twice). While the recipes are fairly good in general, this was not at all what I was looking for and to me, it has defeated the purpose of using the slow cooker. 
 As a teacher of electronic music and a Finale user since 1992, I have been looking for a good, well-written and reasonably priced text on Finale for my students, other than the online documentation (which is actually not so bad in of itself). This book contains some OK beginning exercises for students, but is not what I would expect in a quality textbook on Finale, and for a semester long course in music notation, you run out of topics rather quickly. Particularly, there is no addressing the more powerful aspects of Finale, including the versitale MIDI tool, among other advanced features. I flipped through the Rudolph/Leonard book from Berklee Press briefly, and that looked much more promising, but it is considerably more expensive. Granted, the title of the book does say "Primer", but at the same time, the concept of "Mastering" falls way short with this book 
 With great music and a setting that reminds you of "Vampire Hunter D" it sucks you into watching the series.  The plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing.  The animation is good, which is a must have for me, but it wasn't enough to redeem the series 
 the dolls are made from very good paper, very sturdy. And I have to say I like the design of the clothes whereas they have a front and back that fold over the dolls.  The dolls themselves are very pretty. The details are very nice but the dresses are just not very pretty.  My girls and I expected fairy tales dress but got a little too woodsy ones. the colors are really quite dull- a lot of browns and greens.  Pretty pastels or bright colors like flowers would have been better.  The best thing we can do is mabey make our own dresses.  Sorry, can not recommend this to anyone. I would not have wasted my money it if I had seen it in a store first 
 Major themes in Missing May will be of concern to some parents, yet are not easy to discern from the book's summaries. The characterizations are good. There are moments that might help a reader be more sympathetic towards people who look or act in a way that seems odd to them.   However, in the spiritual realm, there is much to entice readers into the "Church" of Spirituality, the occult, seeking answers with mediums and more. This bundle of confusion is all wrapped in a Newbery award winner which will be on every required reading list throughout the land.   There are parents who would not wish their children to have these issues painted in a positive light, or would like to discuss these things with their children in the light of their own values, but who do not have a clue about the content judging from the book summary. The Newbery award will make it even more likely that unsuspecting parents will have their children read this book, unaware of any conflict with their beliefs.    
 For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house.  On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess 
 The following summarization of Petersen's book is excerpted from the book review-article titled "Unleashing the Storm," available from the website of Creation Ministries International.  "Summary  "If this review were about one or two problems or points of disagreement in a generally sound book, or if the book were such as to likely cause little impact, CMI would see little cause to risk the storm of censure that will doubtless come from many for having been this openly critical. However, the overwhelming thrust of this book falls into an extremely dubious, speculative and poorly argued category, one which may not be instantly obvious to the layperson, and much of what it argues is plain wrong. Most, if not all, of these questionable items have never been peer-reviewed in the creationist scientific journals.  "Apart from the Bible, no book, including any we publish, is perfect. But in this case, the potential for many thousands of people to be seriously misled into believing they have a major weapon, when it is a major step backwards for the creation movement, has led to this review. We also feel that this is the sort of book that your average neighborhood evolutionist will have been `waiting for', in a sense, to reinforce his prejudice that creationists do not understand evolutionary science and misrepresent it, etc. We believe that we have a responsibility to not just refrain from stocking it, but to actively warn against uncritically accepting its contents as if they were generally based on some sort of consensus from the global community of qualified creationist researchers. That would be far from reality.  "Final comment  "It is a hard thing to have to point out this tragic consequence of people `doing their own thing' in creation ministry without any sort of concession to the normal processes of peer review. It is especially hard, because the book is doubtless well-meant, and its motives good Christian ones. Readers of this review who have read the book will no doubt make their own judgment. But if the book doesn't convince creationists such as us, then readers should realize that evolutionists are even less likely to be swayed. At least readers will then be prepared when their evolutionist acquaintances gleefully commence their `demolition derby' on its contents. 
 Another tired story about the Blackman as the horrible villian and the Blackwoman as the innocent victim...And we wonder why our community has so many problems..Maybe it's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films..."Color Purple" , "For Colored Girls...." etc. We need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we "work together"...That means Blackmen and Blackwomen.. 
 The only thing worse than this movie is its fans.  Haha!  Racism is so funny!  VERY NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICE!!!  Normally, I like good jokes about various races and cultures, but the jokes in this movie are simply tasteless and not funny, and the fact that it's produced by the same company that owns Fox New REALLY doesn't help the case.  Like Da Ali G Show, I just don't get it.  Why do so many idiots eat this s hit up and ask for seconds?  It is literally mindnumbing to try and watch this limey try to be funny with retarded catch phrases, broken English (wow, a foreign immigrant who doesn't speak well; real original douchenozzle!), and anti-semetic comments 
    O.K. I didn't buy the book, but I searched for reference to "immortality", which, as I suspected would give a very concise philisophical snapshot of the author. Lets see now, he speaks of the "demographic" problems associated with longer life and lower firtility. First obvious flaw in his reasoning is that we would be marginally active and retire for the last 40 to 50 or so years of a radically extended life(or 1000 years or so). The premise is rediculous because the goal of adult onset gene doping would be to extend health and vitality. Immaging a world in which you could live to 150 years or so with the strength and clearity of a 40 or 30 year old? Are you going to just "sit down in your rocking chair"?      Even going with the worker ratios, in Japan for instance that he speaks of, only 2 for every 1 retired, we could adjust the theory that social security operates-if you retire at age 65 with indefinite life span, you should collect for just 20 years-go back to work, start a business. Go back to school-learn something new-all better ideas than just infering that we should just roll over and die because redical life extension might cause some potential "problems" with systems put in place when humans were suffering and dying at young ages.     Also, "age differences" between the developed world and the underdeveloped world. Yes, there will be definate philosophic differences but they exist for other reasons rather than just "older women"(refering to aging populations that will have a slight increase in female to male ratios) in the North and "younger men"(refering to a higher male to female ratio in younger populations-as well as selective gender bias) in the South, or underdeveloped world. Maybe the influence an older, somewhat more femine population in the West might be a moderating influence governing our policies with regard to the rest of the world? Just a thought. But-waite a minute! Life extension will be available to the men as well as the women, unless we find more men just wanting to "roll over and die".        Mr Fukuyama seems to be saying that changing anything that "makes us human" is wrong.       I have a question to pose to him and any of you out there.      What is so good about being "human"? Lets see, we are a vehicle for the "The Selfish Gene" which only cares about its transmission from one temporary entity to the next-and after the age of reproduction-who cares? Right? So we are disposable!Birth-Shcool-Work-Reproduction-Death. Right about when we start to begin to live, the genetic time bomb begins to visabley manifest itself.       Like Francis, I was born in the middle of the "Baby Boom" generation. I am looking forward to human intellegence being able to preserve precious consciousness indefinitley. I have always known it would happen and I have a better than 50% chance at seeing this. This was considered impossible 30 years ago and I (and others like me) would state this and be shrugged off. What is really of concern to me is that now, we know it is possible but that some believe we should just "roll over and die"! Rediculous! We should persue radical life extension and also encourage near zero total birth rates so we can escape the Birth-School-Work-Reproduction-Death senerio!  
 I had a problem with Brietta a day after I bought her. I was combing her hair, and suddenly her head broke! The part of her head that has hair seperated from her forehead, and there is no way to fix her. So she is stuck with a crack in her skull. I'm very upset about this.  Other than that, I adore my Brietta doll. She has long strawberry blond hair that curls at the end in a messy way, so I cut the hair shorter to get rid of the messy curls.  Her face has a gorgeous expression, which looks so friendly to me. Her gown is light pink with a real overskirt and long sleeves, and she has pink shoes that ACTUALLY STAY ON!  I'm just sad that she broke, but I still love her nonetheless 
 I would like to return this pair shoe.   It's not fit me.   Please send me a return form.  Thanks 
 I bought this CD after falling totally in love with The Road North which I literally played every day for 3 months.  But this CD lacks soul.  It has the feel of a recital.  I am extremely disappointed 
 This book is fine, it's OK, it's not bad. But there's nothing new here. It's not satisfying as biography -- what we gets feels like tiny fragments -- and the critical argument of the book isn't of much interest. The fact that the author essentially disregards the worth of almost all great 20th century poetry not written by the four men that he chooses to focus on is a huge misstep; he could have easily acknowledged the worth of Barbara Guest, the Language poets, Black Mountain, the Beats, etc. but instead either damns them with faint praise or simply damns them, apparently to make his case for the four New York Schoolers stronger. These are four very important poets, yes, but the author seems to be unable to view them in the greater poetic context of the last 100 years, and this puts the book at a serious disadvantage; it may undermine the reader's belief in him as a critic, and it made me, for one, unwilling to follow him down the rather uninteresting critical paths he was mapping out. The quest to determine what is and is not "avant garde" feels misguided and beside the point; how about actually reading the work in a new or compelling way 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 i expected more from a book called the "definitive edition." the book contains a small amount of useful information regarding useful ghost hunting techniques but the majority of information in the book is essentially useless. i would advise serious ghost hunters to not purchase this book 
 The answer is:  he didn't accomplish anything.  This book is a desparate attempt to make Reagan look like an "intellectual".  In one essay, Reagan bemoans the constraints on DDT and other pesticides, insisting there's "no threat to animal, bird or marine life".  Really?  Since when did Reagan have any scientific background to evaluate scientific studies about pesticides?  Of course, Reagan had no scientific basis for this statement--it was just another thing he made up.  Ronald Reagan often cited a Chicago "Welfare Queen" who had ripped off $150,000 from the government, using 80 aliases, 30 addresses, a dozen social security cards, and four fictional dead husbands.   The only trouble is--this Welfare Queen never actually existed.  Reagan made it up.  The followers of Reagan turn him into a fetish.  He was actually a stupid man who said many stupid things which are not true (commonly called "lies").  Conservatives apparently think that someone who lies is a "great" man--but only if the liar is a Republican.  Reagan was a Republican Liar, who lied hundreds of times.  This book does very little to establish Reagan as a "thinker", rather than a senile, stupid man with hate-based ideology 
 This, to me, is nothing but backround noise. I don't know how anyone can really be interested in this "music", there is nothing to be interested in. But, then again this is coming from a drummers perspective, and that may be bias, in a way that there is some sort of rhythm required for it to really catch my ear. So this may be for you if you have a really short attention span. Thank you, that is all. 
 After feverishly finishing Shadowmancer, I instantly went out and bought this novel. Boy, what a disappointment! This book is so lame. Lamer than Attack of the Clones and ewoks combined- and, from me, that is a HUGE insult. It was so bad I hardly forced myself to finish it. I loved Shadowmancer because it so vibarantly expressed Biblical truth in a way that unbelieving readers- Harry Potter exuberants, especially- might not exactly realize what they were reading, but would still get some basic and beautiful truths about Christ into their heads. That was all erased from this novel. NOTHING! Nothing whatsoever. I could almost say that the Buddhist and New Age-swamped Star Wars saga is more spiritually inline than this novel. What happened to good theology? What happened to the grace of Christ? What happened to His love? His protection? How He crushes evil under His heel? What happened to Deutoronomy's harsh veiw on magic that causes me to avoid Harry Potter?   And besides that, it was just not well written at all. Just as bad as Eragon, and GP Taylor is HOW much older than Christopher Paolini?! Tolkien probably wrote this bad when he was FIVE!   Terrible book. Stay away.  But does anybody want my copy? 
 I can't tell if this book is good guide for investing or not, but it lacks in a very important respect - mathematical credibility. Some of very basic statistics examples are just plain wrong, and with major consequences.  The first red flag was the error labeling the Y-axis in the probability distribution figure on page 8. This is labeled "Probability [%]", while any statistician could tell you that this is "Probability density", and in this particular case it is not measured in percents, but is a dimensionless [%/%] value.  Ok, this may be an attempt of oversimplification since the book is clearly intended for general non-technical audience.  However, this made me look back to page 3, where an example is given for calculating the expected annual return in a simple coin-toss scenario. At the time when I was reading it, I thought there is something fishy in this calculation but couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Checking more carefully I found that I was right - when all four cases are considered, the annual return comes out to be neat 10%, and not the 8.17% calculated by Mr. Bernstein.  Well, that might be just another small mistake - these things do happen, I thought.  When I got to page 30, however, I found another version of the same coin-toss scenario, this time with a little complication (tossing two coins, instead of one).  The same incorrect method of calculating the expected annual return was used by Mr. Bernstein, giving value of 9.08%, as compared to the real value of 10%.  Just another minor error?  Absolutely not!  Because the author uses the two [wrong] values of 8.17% and 9.08% to argue that similar cases will increased expected return (see the note in p.30). A lot in the rest of the book is based on this assumption.  I'm not an economist.  Maybe this book have some real value in it. All I know is that Mr. Bernstein got wrong even the very basic statistics, and used this wrong results to prove some "basic principle".  And this principle is laying in the base of his theory.  If the simplest math is messed up, what are the chances that the far more complex calculations involved in the rest of the book were done properly?  There we don't get any information on what method was used for calculation, nor we get any data sets so we can check it.  I wouldn't bet my money on it!  I forced myself to get to page 60-something.  It doesn't get any better.  Yes, it sounds good, it sounds convincing.  But there are more and more tiny mistakes, scattered in the text, that leave the impression that the author attended a basic statistics class, learned some terminology, got some ideas (many he got wrong), and set out to write a book, thinking he is an expert.  Believe me, any reasonably bright college student will do far better.  My marks for the book are:  - Investment ideas quality:  UNKNOWN - Math reasoning quality: ZER 
 WELL I LIKE THEIR CD BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE LIVE PERFORMANCES ON CDS WHERE EVERYONE IS CLAPPING AND SHOUTING. I LIKE THE VERSIONS WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STUDIO AND EVERYTHING IS PEACEFUL. I WOULD  HAVE MUCH PREFERRED THE STUDIO VERSION BETTER 
 This book was not very good.  It doesn't give enough solutions to behavior problems 
 Mirrors are too small and too distorted.  The picture on the package shows a perfect reflection - as if!!    It's about as useful as taping two foil-wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them 
 The UV light went out on the sanitizer five days after using 24 hours a day.  There is no restriction as to the amount of usage.  Where can you get replacement lights 
 My kids love Magnetix, but I am unable to order them online because you do not ship to Canada. This problem occurs a lot. Someone should fix that. I find it very frustrating when I try to order something and then it tells me they are "unable to fullfill my order because we can't ship outside the USA" 
 Why release WrestleMaina's that are already on dvd? Anther thing WrestleMaina is months away, it was a perfect time to release the big four in order. Survivor Series entire series, then Royal Rumble, then WrestleMaina, and finally Summerslam. Made sense but WWE really doesnt think well sometimes. 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
  There seems to be a growing concensus that this text is flawed in certain key areas. Astutely, several reviewers have cited Pali sources which flatly refute the somewhat nihilistic views of the author. On close reading, it is surely evident that a denial of the 'self' identified with the skandhas does not deny the 'citta' as basis. Still, I don't think this observation is helpful, when Harvey's critics succumb to the temptation to translate 'citta' as 'soul.' Even so, the positive use of citta as base, viz. - that which is freed from the influence of the skandhas, certainly represents 'Self' as ground. In the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Buddha even reintroduced explicit reference to the 'Self' - as Mahatman. As one of the reviewers has noted, the Buddha even used the term 'svabhava' for it - despite everything else said about 'ni-svabhava' vis-a-vis 'pratitya-samupada' and the skandhas.    It is worth noting that the Hindu critics of Buddhism have frequently mistaken it for nihilism, despite the fact that the Buddha denied nihilistic doctrines. We need to redefine the terms we are using  - and, recover the terms we have forgotten.       
 Too cute, clever, annoying emphasis on the cigar smoking habit of the male detective. Story did not seem authentic. I read about half and then quit...looked at the end and sure enough, it ends with more whining about the cigar smoking! Such a shame. Seemed like it could have been a good book 
 Not only does this toaster burn toast on one side, even at low settings, the force of the toaster has a tendency to projectile bagels and particularly toast onto the counter, and if positioned close to the edge of the countertop, on to the floor. We are very disappointed with this purchase. 
 The plot of the story is Ludlum all the way, but the narrative is no where near Ludlum. I am having a hard time getting through it. Will probably give up before half way 
 the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointtin 
 The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You,  and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun 
 It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the  myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other  than that, it's an interesting read 
 I revived my interest in Ms. Barber when I found that the authoritative Penguin Guide, which has long been one of the strongest influences in my purchase decision, actually listed her in the new edition and, to my further surprise, she was very positively reviewed.  I thought I must have missed something back then, or perhaps she got much better.  So I decided to give her a second chance, and picked up "Nightclub," which appeared to be the closest to a standard album, partly in fear of hearing another electrified pop album.  The first few tracks sounded promising. Marc Johnson's bassline filled air with smooth jazzy feel, along with sweet touch of brushes.  It did seem I was missing something before.  Unfortunately, things were gradually going wrong toward the later tracks.  Despite her crisp touch of keyboards, her voice doesn't seem to ring the bell on "Summer Samba," which would have been much better off as a joyful bossa nova tune.  And then the dead end came in track 11, "A Man and a Woman." was an absolutely depressing experience.   In Ms. Barber's recordings, I feel bored with her monotonous, sparkless, same-style songs for extended 60 minutes.   To me, she seems to be "forced" to sing that way all the time, not necessarily because she wants that way, but due to the lack of her ability otherwise.    Well, should I have just said she's not my cup of tea?  After all, who cares about this no-name review anyway?  She will still sell more CDs than most of the jazz singers today, and her next shows will continue to be sold out.  So, I don't think I have to apologize for an occasional lack of respect for a hard-working musician.  Variety is spice of life, no 
 I was very disappointed with this book. I had already made the decision to breast feed before buying this book, so I was bored reading the lengthy text about why I should breastfeed.   Breastfeeding is tricky and frustrating in the beginning. You will have a lot of questions about what you can, can't eat, how often you need to breastfeed, what signs you should look for to determine if your baby has an allergy to food, and how to start weaning if you are going back to work. The book doesn't provide enough detail to answer these questions. Also the organization of the book didn't make sense to me and the index is not helpful.   I found the website kellymom.com much more helpful in terms of providing breastfeeding tips and answers to breastfeeding questions. 
 This book is written as if it is a parody of a new age self-help book. I simply can't believe that any intelligent person would take it seriously. I heard of the poem and it is sort of nice in a new agey way. The book, which I looked at in a bookstore, is just laughable. Come on, people 
 I have ordered several Le Creuset items, and have always been happy with my purchase.  Not so with this teapot.  I cannot use it on my stovetop, according to the warnings posted on the packaging.  
 I came to this book very interested in knowing more about Ho and to see this period of history told from the perspective of a figure not normally viewed as a major player.  Having previously read Paul Preston's biography of Franco (a long book), I was hoping this would be of similar quality (see my review of Preston's book).  It's not.  This book is very detailed.  As one of the other reviewers notes, there are specifics about all sorts of travels and meetings with all sorts of names, places, and times.  But, nothing really ties these things together to make a story.  It's so bad that I haven't finished the book and probably never will.  So, why 2 stars instead of a total blast of 0 or 1 star?  Because I do believe the author has been thorough and so this deserves some respect.  I just wish there had been an editor or someone to help turn this into a story.  And the final plug:  Preston's book about Franco is really good 
 This book is unapologetically about triviality. It begins with the rise of popularity of the trivial, illusion and fakery, in America since the time of P.T. Barnum. It is about the creators and consumers of illusion who  replaced 'survivors' in after the transition to life in the megalopolis in  America. John Berger has pointed out that zoos, stuffed animals, pets and  eventually Disneyworld emerged as mankind became divorced from the fight to  survive against nature, where animals were essential. The book does not  explain why, in its appetite for illusion and triviality (consumerism,  consumption of the media) America is so advanced with respect to Europe  (the decline is there, if slower: the worst Hollywood films are extremely  popular among Europe's youth). Gamson informs us of Holmes' expectation  that photography would lead to the triumph of superficiality, and of  Boorstin's description of the celebrity as a person who is well-known for  his well-knownness. Political campaigns are accurately described as  pre-packaged media affairs, where the participants have become game-players  and the events themselves, like talk-shows, have become pseudo-events.  People immitating the media immitating people. The future is trivial  because trivial expectations determine the future via pre-packaged daily  behavior. Gamson does not explain why we have evolved to this state of  super-triviality, and why we seem to be stuck with it. This was more or  less explained poetically by Spengler, and also poetically in still fewer  words by John Berger, who informs us clearly and concisely on the subjects  of Gamson's discourse: "It would ... be possible to talk of the  'homelessness' of the bourgeois with his town house, his country home, his  three cars, his televisions, his tennis court, his wine cellar-it would be  just possible, yet nothing about his class interests me, for there is  nothing left to discover." Gamson's book is precisely about the  people, and their admirors, about whom there is nothing worth discovering 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 Never received the product, accoring to amazon it was delivered a week ago. It was actually delivered to Amazon not me! Not even a phone call. I will never buy another thing from them 
 I got this device to help me clean around my place.  I thought it would be easy to use, and it is  not.  The pads do not stay on.  When you are trying to put them on, the solution leaks all over you.  After working on my shower, I saw no difference.  I wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth. 
 The Case for Marriage makes arguments supportive of Pres. Bush's policies on marriage. However, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post (1/26/5) reports that Maggie Gallagher was paid over $40,000 by the Bush Administration to write columns and a "private" report supporting its $300 million HHS marriage initiative.   Mr. Kurtz reports that Ms. Gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers, writing "I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it." She also states she was "aware vaguely" that her work was federally funded. It must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $40,000. Bad memory, vagueness, national column: what will we say to the children?   I wonder who paid Ms. Gallagher to write this book 
 If you are a fan of Dark Angel, you will probably be very disappointed by the ending of this book.  I was very upset that a major theme of the second season of the Dark Angel TV series was treated as an afterthought and casually disposed of.  It also has a glaring astronomical mistake (which sadly I cant go into detail since it may be a spoiler and thus contrary to the review guidelines).     
 Dan Brown is so full of bunk that his breath smells bad! This is a compilation of much of the same garbage that he included in his book. He tries, not very convincingly to prove his points. Someone reading his garbage that does not have a strong Bible based upbringing would be confused by Brown's fiction. I would recommend any other DVD, preferably something more uplifting 
 I was very exited about this movie. I waited and waited for it to come out on DVD so I could see it. I even ordered the documentary from the website and watched it long before the actual film. Being a big Mike Patton fan also boosted my anticipation of this film that was reviewed as being "the kind of film David Lynch wishes he was still capable of making", or something along those lines. David Lynch is a genius and has made some of my all-time favorite films. The notion that Firecracker even approaches Lynch is absurd. This movie sucked and is an insult to film-making.   I will say that some of the visuals were artistic and looked beautiful, but Balderson's alternation between color and B&W seemed unnecessary and without reason. If I'm wrong, please correct me. Using both color and B&W can add to a movie if done with taste and style. It was excessive and annoying in this pretentious piece.   One of my biggest complaints is of the dialogue. I found myself in constant agitation at how terrible and pointless the characters were. Mike Patton did display quite a presence and could be a good actor with some practice, though I think he should probably just stick with music. His scenes were the only thing about any of the acting that I enjoyed.   It seemed like the movie was very rushed; like the film-makers were trying to save money on film by doing a single take for each scene. There were some camera shots with good angles and composition that could stand alone as art, but unfortunately that's not enough to save the film.  When it was finished I thought to myself that it seemed like the movie was written by an eighth grade cheerleader trying to be edgy and artsy. My advice is simply this: don't waste money even renting this movie. Stick with David Lynch if you want good art films.    
 That Robert Coles' heart is in the right place and that his experience working with children is extensive, no one can dispute.  But his writing is characterized by wordiness - even chattiness - and it undermines the serious nature of his topic. Perhaps the loose writing style is an attempt to make the book appeal to "every parent," - and not just educators - but instead it renders the whole work laborious and permeated with a condescending, patronizing tone. In the current political culture, a book on the moral life of children written by an educator of Coles' calibre would be expected to nail a spot on the N.Y. Times bestseller list for weeks, if not years.  The fact that less than two years after publication I picked up a hard cover copy at a book clearance for 75% off is a testimony to lazy editorship more than anything else. What a huge loss for our society 
 I expected this book to be more of a training manual of techniques. Instead, every page is a photo with a VERY brief explanation of how or where it was taken, often without enough detail to recreate the idea. Although the photos are beautiful and Tony Sweet is a great photographer, the book is not at all what I expected. If you're looking for a photo book of his work, it's great, but don't expect to learn much from it 
 A very poorly written, and ill reasoned book.  Very biased against Israel.  I would not recommend it at all 
 The popups in this book were NOT well crafted, they were clunky and didn't always work and with time they quickly cease to function from wear and tear.   One might forgive this passage of time factor were it not for the fact that there is NOTHING imaginative about this book. Its a collection of straightforward boring concepts, nothing new, nothing detailed or exciting, boring boring boring. Do NOT get sucked in by the cool concept and title, this book is a big waste of money.  
 I bought this book thinking it would be a good beach read but I never really could get into it. The characters were boring. Way too much whining. The plot was very slow. I finally had to put it down 
 This book is one of the worst that I've ever read in life. It doesn't have any person that you want to learn more about, in fact, by the end of this novel, you'll be glad Beckett finally shut-up. The novel seems to be writen in some horrible attempt at poetry at points and lacks a plot. In fact, it is not until near the end of the novel do we learn anything about the storyline. For a book that seemed to gain praise from many, it makes me sad that the trees, that were used to make this book died in vien. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. I'm just glad I only paid a doller for it 
 In her excruciating effort to outlaw the slightest discrimination, Nussbaum neglects the worst discrimination of all: that based on age.  The child in the womb, the disabled infant, the elderly patient threatened by  Kevorkian find no safe harbor here.  And in her pleas for tolerance, the  intolerance toward the religious person, especially the Roman Catholic and  the Muslim, finds no censure.  For all the metaphysical wallpaper, this is  nothing but a tract for the politically correct dowager in Westchester 
 If it's not already obvious, Monster Cable is the carpetbagger of the home entertainment world. With the rapid development of new HD and audio technology, Monster Cable does their best to be the first to provide cables--but not without charging a horrendously inflated premium. In this case, all you're getting for your 20 bucks is an RCA-to-1/8" converter and eight feet in between. Sony makes a great 5-foot cable for less than four dollars, and if the length is what you really need, you can daisychain a couple of those together for still less than half of the price of Monster Cable's offering. It is important to be aware than in the world of electronics, and in fact everywhere, someone will try to rip you off 
 Something like 15 years ago, I ran across the first three annual volumes of this anthology at a science fiction and fantasy bookstore.  Ever since, I've eagerly looked forward to every volume, for weeks or months ahead of publication.  Once received, each yielded a couple of weeks of daily reading treat.  I admit, since I dislike horror, I've always wished that the horror had been spun off into a separate volume.  Still, Ellen Datlow's taste in horror is pretty sophisticated, some of it being closer to dark fantasy, which I do like.  I always read the horror last.  But Terri Windling's fantasy selection more than made up for the horror content of the volume.  All those stories culled from "literary" magazines I never read (as being too modern and New-Yorky) for my taste.  And her roundups/brief reviews of new fantasy books!  I've discovered so many "mainstream" books and authors not marketed as fantasy from Windling's reviews.  Since the inception of Amazon, every roundup had me rushing to put at least ten more books in my shopping cart.  Unfortunately, this is probably the last annual volume I'll ever buy.  The new team editing the fantasy content, Kelly Link and Gavin Grant, just are not up to Windling's standards.  First, in both the story selection and the roundups, it seems that they did not read nearly as wide a range of sources as Windling did. Second, their selections were lackluster.  The stories I really liked I'd already read in major fantasy magazines. The others were . . . sort of all right.  Mildly interesting.  But not worth that many pages.  I discovered one book worth buying in the review roundups, which were also lackluster.    All in all, the uninteresting fantasy combined with that much horror, meant that the two weeks' delight I'd experienced for so many years, turned into a month-long slog, with me frequently counting stories (I don't read them in order) to see if I was finally almost done with the thing yet.  Let's hope there's another change of editors soon.  And maybe, just maybe, they'll put the horror in a separate anthology, where it belongs 
 Not just simple ideas in this one but stupid ones too.  No one should ever read this colossal waste of time unless by reading you mean beating yourself unmercifully on the face and head until death occurs 
 This novel by A.E.W. Mason is an epic tale about a young soldier named Harry Feversham. After receiving three white feathers of cowardness from his fellow soldiers, and one from Ethne, Harry sets out to redeem himself. The novel is slow to start, and stays dull throughout his ventures. For being a love story during a time of war, the book is lacking romance and battle. There are so many characters in the book that none of them ever seem to be fully developed; not even Harry. Halfway through the book I found myself wondering who three quarters of the characters were and what their significant role was in the novel. I have read the book twice and I still have no clue why Harry was retrieving the letters from the wall and what their importance was to the story. If you chose this book to read at night to put you to sleep, or really like patriotic British war stories, then by all means, this may be the book for you. As far as I'm concerned, the book was extremely hard to follow, the characters had little depth, and there was no action at all (this is supposed to be a story about a soldier). The novel was extremely predictable, and like most love stories, everything ends happily ever after. After Harry's heroic acts in the desert the three soldiers take their feathers back and this also wins Ethne's heart.   
 A dull, tedious, melodramatic effort that wastes the cast and the craft of scene setting.  Everything goes out the window once people start moving and talking and it takes hours for the story to reach the predictable non-conclusion.  The film is laden with cliches and burdened by a lack of focus.  Pick a story out of here and you can make 20 films, but don't throw together teasers and expect everyone to appreciate the slow-mo trainwreck of family tragedies that this movie encompasses 
 I remembered liking big audio dynamite, so I thought I'd check out their greatest hits cd.  I did not recognize a single song.  None of the songs I do like were included.  I am not sure what criteria they used to determine their greatest hits, but this collection of songs is really subpar.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I thought this book would be so helpful to me, an artist looking for a tolerable day job while I continue to pursue my career.  Unfortunately, it was quite a disappointment.  I took the quiz and it identified me as a type which I honestly don't agree with.  Most of the recommended jobs were neither interesting nor creative.  The rest were impossibly out of reach, such as symphony conductor or State Director of Natural Resources (I mean come on - there are only 50 in the nation and they are political appointees).  The last straw was when it recommended my current position - a job in which I am slowly dying from lack of stimulation 
 I am a big Popper fan, but this book is out-of-date, although it contains valuable information.  Popper's arguments for indeterminism are based on the body-mind distinction: 'physicalism (or the philosophy of the identity of mind and body) is absurd.' G. Edelman explains clearly in his brilliant book 'Bright Air, Brilliant Fire' that mind is a matter of matter. Consciousness is an emerging characteristic of life after a long evolution. Popper's system of 3 Worlds is also flawed (World 1: physical world - brain physiology; World 2: subjective thought - human consciousness; World 3: objective thought - theories), because World 1 and 2 are the same.  His arguments against philosophical and scientific determinism are powerful, but scientifically speaking Laplace's demon is a joke. As Steven Hawking explains in John Boslough's 'Steven Hawking's Universe': 'Even if we do achieve a complete unified theory, we shall not be able to make detailed predictions in any but the simplest situations.' Predictions will be limited to the extreme and determinism will be non-existant in brain physiology (Mozart's G minor symphony could not have been predicted). Indeterminism will be all the more true in the social sciences (historicism). Indeterminism is a cardinal characteristic of matter: all singular events in this world are unique, free.  It is very strange that some of the brightest scientific minds (Einstein, Schroedinger) were staunch defenders of determinism (see Popper's discussions with Einstein on p. 90-92). The fact that Einstein changed his mind at the end of his life is not confirmed in M. Jammer's book 'Einstein and Religion'.  On the other hand, Popper's remark on the arrow of time is to-the-point: 'As to the arrow of time, it is in my opinion a mistake to make the second law of thermodynamics responsible for its direction. Even a non-thermodynamic process, such as the propagation of a wave from a centre, is in fact irreversible.'  Very important is note 3 on p. 43. J. von Neumann, H.H. Goldstine: 'a mathematical formulation necessarily represents only a (more or less explicit) theory of some phase (or aspect) of reality, not reality itself.'  I recommend this book only for Popper fans 
 Its amazing with all the resources of 911 Commission at their disposal, they could not find an operational link between Hussein and al Qaeda. If the Commission could only get the Bush/Cheney team to testify under oath, there wouldn`t even be a debate.  Perhaps Hayes should spend time reading their final  report which claimed there was no link between Iraq and 911. But Hayes like his other conservative peers have a gift of throwing half truth and innuendo at their faith based readers to come to ludicrous conclusions.   
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 This book is bland, bland, bland. Basically it was written by someone who knows nothing about the vending business...they just did a little research on it and put together a lousy book. I own a successful vending business and thought a book from Entreprener Magazine might be handy to get some new ideas from...but it's not. There are few good ideas in this book, old or new. There are better books out there on vending - this one is a waste of time & money 
 As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.  Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?  For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though 
 The ski rack is attached to the Thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar. The old 724 had metal connectors. Making them plastic is insane. These connectors will break over time. Additionally, a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors. 
 William Gaines must be rolling around in his grave. Shame, shame...AVOID THIS 
 I ordered this item in July , and I've been getting order delay notices every 15 days or so. Now the estimated shipping is January 2007 ! I think I'm going to celebrate the first anniversary of ordering this product. The item was still shown as In Stock, untill very recently. If you are planning on styling your hair in this era, don't order this product 
 yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
 The Age of Access provides a thorough report on the dissonance of traditional culture in a technological sphere at the turn of the century focussing on the derivatives of capitalism from a social and economic perspective. Jeremy discusses the impact of electronic commerce on society, but omits the role of the individual in the formation of culture; he acknowledges the value of ideas and intangible assets, but disputes the commercial power of multinational corporations. The Age of Access takes the blue tack of economics and the red tack of politics and bounds them together to make them undistinguishable from each other by inadvertently encrypting the concept of capitalism and statism. The main flaw of the book is that it feeds on the readers false assumptions of capitalism. The Age of access more subliminally describes how the shift from individual rights to the violation of privacy is transforming modern life. The author does not take into account that a culture does not come up with ideas, individuals do, and that a superficial society that suppresses individualism will naturally deteriorate.  
 Needless to say, it wasn't. While Irving's literary style always has merit, he does a poor job at characterization- which is especially disappointing, considering the title of the book is "The World According To Garp." With a name like that, you'd expect the title character to be perceiving and insightful, but instead Garp is boring and egocentric, thinking of little but his own cheap desires. If that was the point, then I feel duped.  And while his mother is certainly more interesting- she's even more self-absorbed, and so it hardly makes up for anything. There's an almost sociopathic quality to his main characters, and while Irving probably didn't intend to portray them that way- it's still an enormous flaw I was unable to overlook 
 I know it is your birthday, but two is all I can give. These final ruminations of 'the world's most gentle soul' try to shed light on a very universal question: "But I, detached from them and from everything, what am I?"  A fine question, but one flawed from the very start as nothing can be truly detached from everything.    With his ten walks over forest and dale, Rousseau attempts to melt himself into his beloved 'nature,' but he never succeeds.  The 'I' always gets in the way of things.  The Solitary Walker is the arch-subjectivist.  Every perception, every thought, every plant he examines, every rock he stumbles over is hopelessly locked in an internal prison that remains distant and inpenetrable to others.  True enough, we all do much the same, but thankfully, few of us ever write books about our self-absorbed fancies and fantasies.  Rousseau's complete oeuvre is one long monologue between him and the world.  And this monologue can only achieve meaning in those rare moments when Jean throws a life-line across the chasm of solipsism and allows others to swing across to his vibrant jungle of ideas.  The Social Contract and especially, Emile, are two such works where Rousseau made contact with his world.  By choosing two objective territories, politics and education, he managed to find a fixed rod around which to weave his very original thoughts and musings.  And because these two works have a common core, Rousseau's fecund imagination never gets the better of him.  With the Reveries on the other hand, Rousseau and reader get mired down in a swamp of delusion and meaningless speculation.  I was hoping that the Reveries' central theme of man and his  environment would anchor this work and lend to insight upon insight.  Nothing of the like came about.  Those seeking an examination of our connection with nature will be greatly disappointed in this work.  Nature here is just a backdrop, the faintly sketched background to Rousseau's internal dialogues.  Why do people hate me?  Why do they persecute me?  What did I do to enflame such passion against myself?  Why is such a noble man so loathed by his society?  These are the questions Rousseau, mantra-like, constantly churns over during his walks in the woods. Rousseau's agile mind goes in circles chasing its tail, and soon the reader too gets a bit dizzy.  Where are the answers to such questions?  Jean provides defense after defense, each more noble-sounding and indignant than the last, but all equally flaccid and wrong-headed.  And through it all, the nature he so loved and which could have cured him of his delusions had he truly surrendered to it, remains an impotent canvas.  What this work so lacks is what so many of us lack as well: distance.  Had Rousseau been able to view himself as only a part of the whole---a significant and individual one at that---but nothing more, than this work could have become a guidebook of self-transcedence: How to Break the I.  As it remains though, The Reveries of the Solitary Walker is nothing more than the diary of a captive mind, denied its fair share, crying out for the whole. A whole which it can never have, nor become.  Alas, let us not be too hard on this sensitive soul, for most of us walk through life with our own daily routine of solitary reveries which keep us from tipping over the cliffs of despair.  Jean-Jacques' Reveries warn us that it is precisely our reveries that send us over the edge. 
 Apparently Peg Perego has many different 6 volt batterys for there ride on toys.  I purchased this on for an older version of the train and it does not fit or have the correct connector.  Now in trying to return the wrong battery I can get no assistance from Amazon.com.  No one will answer my e-mails and there is no phone # listed anywhere to call customer service.  Make sure this is the correct battery for the toy you have before purchasing it 
 I started out an avid Eco fan. I read Focoult's Pendulum. Twice! Name of the Rose, Island... and Misreadings. Loved the first two, learned a lot from all of Umberto's books. Brilliant man and tireless writer.  But when I read The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, I kept glancing ahead to see if it would get better. Quite a bit went into the pictoral essay of 20th Century book art. I gave Eco the benefit of a doubt; after all, when has he ever let me down before? Though I commend his errudition...isn't it dreadful when the word comes up in a review? It isn't enough to bring a promising premise out of the flatline of death (no pun intended). The final act of the book just plunges into an absurd pagent of kitsch, that must have been a tribute to pop-culture icons, but in the end the payoff was miniscule.   My overwhelming aftertast of The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana was disappointment. It seemed the book had promise to deliver the kind of excitement and intrigue of Focault and Name...but instead, ended up reading like a bibliography catalog of Out-of-Print/Permanently Discontinued books that died on dusty shelves, now long forgotten 
 The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition 
 The notion of "interpretive communities" is at best derivative of Kuhn's classical work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and at worst a framework of obstruction employed against those who wish to revivify literary theory and criticism in the wake of postmodern hegemony 
 A lover's betrayal. . . A killer on the loose. . .   Eve Duncan was actually happy. She had a man who loved her, an adoptive daughter as great as her own, and her dead daughter's bones were found and safely buried. But then a letter in the mail opens her eyes to a secret her boyfriend, Joe Quinn, kept for two full years. Now she wants away from him, and when a job opportunity in a different state presents itself, she packs her bags and leaves. On her first night in Louisiana, someone tries to kill her, and they won't give up until she's dead! Will she uncover the secret in time? Or will death silence her?  When I picked up this book I wasn't surprised it got high on every bestsellers list. It was moving a mile a minute and between the hired assassins, secrets, deaths, and conspiracies, I knew I was reading a great novel. And then, after chapter 5, the book came to a stop and decided to creep at turtle speed. The character of Eve Duncan became uncharacteristically naive and immature, while her 12 year old adoptive daughter Jane was acting like a 50 year old, smart and mature beyond her years. The book dragged all until chapter 12. Once chapter 12 begins, the book takes flight once again and the bombs (literally) start going off. The ending was good and though I thought it was predictable, it was still somewhat enjoyable. It wasn't as good as the first two books in that series, but it was better then the third. 
 ﻿Millennials Rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, focusing this time on the generation born after X.  For those not already familiar with the authors' theory, Strauss and Howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991. They wrote the book Generations, which introduced a theory that generations fall into four re-cycling types, and each type comes of age during a different kind of era, or "turning". The Silent Generation is of the "adaptive" type, for instance, passive, gentle, and in tune with their emotions, and came of age during the Golden Age of postwar America. The Baby Boomers, remembered for their "Awakening" in the 1960s, are of the "idealist" type, concerned with God and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in, but inclined to change during life (from hippie to the current "Just say no" control freak). Generation X, which they named the Thirteenth Generation, is of the "reactive" type, being alienated, street-smart and materialistic, without a feeling of need to be "loyal" to anything, coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s. They then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the "Millennial Generation", and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be optimistic, hard-working and clean-cut, just like the G.I. Generation that fought World War II, going back to the "civic" type generation before the Silent Generation. In 1993 they published the book Thirteenth Gen, which specialized in Generation X and why they are the way they are. In their third book, The Fourth Turning, they went back to the whole theory and writing about all the generations. They also changed the archetype names from adaptive, idealist, reactive and civic to Artist, Prophet, Nomad and Hero. Strauss and Howe wrote in this book about an upcoming era of epic battle and mass destruction, much like the one in which the G.I. Generation came of age. They then predicted the Millennial Generation would form the role of Heroes during the coming crisis, and they would lower teen pregnancy rates, stop using drugs, serve the United States, in uniform even, and desist with using profanity.  So then in 2000 they put out this book, Millennials Rising. In this one the authors try to explain the Millennial Generation (my generation). Millennials Rising attempts to identify who we, the most ethnically diverse generation in American history as they note, are. In Millennials Rising they write about this generation's Boomer parents and their influence on the Millennial Generation, as well as the kind of world in which this generation is growing up (which S&H think of as hundreds of television channels, SUV lifestyles, rappers who swear, and people who smack each other on TV). The book states that Millennials want to work together in teams, believe the people in authority know more about right and wrong than they do, are enthusiastic about learning and going to school, are loved and protected by their parents, achieve great things in school and will achieve great things in the future, and lest we forget, always want to exude that "positive peer pressure" on their fellow Millennials.  The obviously leads to the question, then, is the generation really optimistic, hard-working and clean-cut just as they say? Consider this: Only 28% of high school seniors say that the work they get assigned at school is "meaningful", only 21% describe their courses as "interesting" and still barely over a third, 39%, believe that what they do in school will have any relation to their success later in life. The generation was supposed to be enthusiastic about learning. The Millennial Generation also rapidly increased drug use, especially pot, from the level at which Generation X was using them in its teens, as even the authors themselves note.  S&H portray the world of edgy entertainment, such as television shows, movies and music, as a Zoroastrian battle. In popular music, for instance, artists are described by extremes that either represent the alleged Millennial values or go actively against them -- on one side, artists like Eminem, Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson, on the other, boy bands and Britney Spears and her imitators, along with such second-tier bands as the S Club 7. They do not deal with the Millennial interest in bands that lie somewhere in between the two. For instance, Blink-182 is just about the biggest band around now, and yet Millennials Rising does not mention Blink-182 and the many young fans who make the band a success. South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut is the authors' idea of where popular culture is today. Millennials Rising heralds boy bands as what music will increasingly be like as the current decade unfolds, and blasts the "edgy" bands as groups that will be washed away, but could the authors have predicted bands like Good Charlotte or artists like Avril Lavigne?  This leads to the bigger question of whether the book and the theory will be able to predict anything. S&H write about "rebelling by being better" during the present decade. Apparently, their idea of rebellion is not listening to Limp Bizkit, blasting censorship, or doing illegal drugs, but wearing preppy clothes, waiting until marriage to have sex, and trusting their government. According to them, we should expect to see Millennials petitioning for policies that will punish their own peers. S&H write that we will accept the draft and join the military in great numbers when the crisis presents us with a war, and even do National Service. Frankly, can anyone imagine any more than 20% of today's high school students doing their duty and risking their life in war in the name of America? Also, our generation has done nothing to make a commitment to following Bush as leader during the Iraq War, while S&H predict Millennials serving their president. How suited to a Hero generation is that? The G.I. Generation followed FDR so blindly they had to print his campaign materials in Braille. When it comes to rallying around their president and leading the direction of the nation during a crisis, Millennials have surely disappointed those who expected them to do just as the authors said we would. This, of course, does not have to be a bad thing, but it does make you wonder about the limitations of the predictive abilities of the theory.  Some parts of it make for very interesting reading, but all the talk about how they are to be the "next great" generation gets to you sometimes. S&H seem to believe you can never think too big about those Millennials. Millennials Rising presents an image of youth that is set to amaze you and will attract readers, but sometimes what the book describes just isn't happening 
 Jhumpa Lahiri's writing has style but draws from  limited experiences- mostly that of displaced immigrants. After her first book, this limited storytelling, this attempt to extract maximum mileage out of small pains,  gets boring. Gogol is named Gogol because that writer meant a lot to his father. However the author fails to show why someone would thank Gogol when surviving a train accident. At the end of the story Gogol finds the book of stories his father had gifted him, and cluthes on to it as a guide for the years to come. This is supposed to be the 'climax' but it does not evoke much emotion. 
 if you are shoting kid at the swiming pool, it's ok. but,if you are the open water diver, please don't buy it. i try it yesterday, it will not work after 10m/33ft, it will show the red screen and count down timer, it scare me. and i miss a lot of shot for yesterday's dive. it's really disappointed to me 
 Are we all mad???? No really?   This is a nice book.   Well presented and well-made but it is blank book and how much does it cost?   The Book of Shadows is a sacred book of spells, recipes and feelings.   It does not have to be leather(look)-bound and cost a fortune.   It is the content which is valuable not the coverings.  Sorry to be so negative.   Blessed be 
 We own about 15 of the Scholastic video DVDs and I've shown them to children from 3 to 6 - including my son who is 4.5. Curious George is good of course, but I was not impressed by any of the others on this dvd. My (3 yr old daycare) kids would barely watch this one

 Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time 
 The book should be renamed to "How to Clean".  The current title sounds like it would give tips on making housework quicker and easier--boy that was way off!  The book gives basic details on cleaning a house as any person might already be aware of and there were no shortcuts mentioned.  If  you're looking for timesaving techniques, it's not here 
 Although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any how-to-write book, my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise (such as "Cheaters never win") before you begin to write. This kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers, leading to work that can be preachy, predictable, and cliched. Many times, the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process, but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an ill-fitting formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer 
 I find it very amazing that if you click on the "See my all reviews" box that these same people also highly recommend all the other books by the same author?  WOW imagine that! Type in the names Harris H. McIlwain and Debra Fulghum Bruce in a search engine and see the 100 other books these people have in print. They sound like the experts for every sickness and illness known to man.  There is some good advice, but nothing new here, snake-oil at best like so many books on the market.   
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 I Like This Album, Especially The 10th Song "Crime Of The Century".  This Song Is Fun, And I Like It.  I Typed The Lyrics On My Computer.  In August 2002 I Sang The Song At The Boys And Girls Club Staff Member.  Some Of The Staff Members Like This Song.  I Hope I Will Sing This Song At School If There Is A Talent Show At Schoo 
 I gave this book a reading not too long ago. Nothing about this book is "controversial". It's the same manipulation of information that neo-nazis and the kkk use to put shame to folks of other races. Books like these have always existed, and their purpose is to make money from readers who think the message is "ground-breaking" or revealing of some deep knowledge that has always been hidden from the public. If you plan on picking up this book, be sure to pick up a confederate flag and a few skrewdriver albums to go with it, this book is equally brainless 
 I was extremely disappointed when I read this book. Rough Amusements: The True Story of A'Lelia Walker etc. should be retitled as the True Story of Jennie June. If you want to learn more about Jennie June and [alternative] culture in New York during the late 1880's to the 1930's read this book otherwise pick up a copy of The Black Rose a much better fictionalized account of the life of Madame C.J. Walker and her daugther A'Lelia 
 Most depictions of the Rave scene tend to preach from an extreme. They either present a picture of modern-day-Sodom, or will extol the discovery of Nirvana-on-Earth. Reynolds has the ability to [beautifully] describe both faces of the scene with an impartial voice.  Unfortunately, that is the end of what he has done well. Simon will take one paragraph to state that in years past the focus was simply the event, and no one bothered to learn the names of DJ's, let alone the name of individual tracks. After which he will begin a 10-page meandering description about specific track titles released in a 6-month period.  That example highlights Simon's shortcomings: no one involved in the scene at that time can recall every DJ or specific song names. Worse yet, those names are going to be meaningless to everyone reading the book in an attempt to learn about the scene.  Scenesters of the day aren't seeking a book that provides a blow-by-blow account of Simon's search for an illegal party on a particular night, they're looking to be reminded of a bygone time, feeling, and vibe they recall from those days. And people reading the book to learn about the history of "rave" are seeking to understand the human experience of the time, and not the name of a producer living in Germany who released a top-40 track at the end of the 80's.  In truth, Simon does cover enough information from front cover to back cover that the reader will indubitably have gained a clear understanding of the history of raves. Unfortunately, the reader will have to winnow through 90% fluff to reach that goal 
 What more would you expect from a revisionist historian whose books read like novels, with no researches yet dressing up all half baked hypotheses as proven theses. Treat this book as some infantile rantings from an inadequate mind 
 Using this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader's PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author's PhotoShop. However, my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the CD-ROM. Furthermore, this author doesn't start at a "dummies" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along. Overall, this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn PhotoShop from a baseline of complete ignorance 
 This is seriously the worst movie ever.  The last time I saw it was in the theater, and I still can't get over how bad it was.  In fact, it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy.... We didn't speak for six months after we saw it together!  I too wish I could give it no stars.... And obviously people aren't looking for this movie since the last review was in 2002!  I can't believe you can even buy it on DVD 
 'Human Rights' is a small book that discusses some current issues pertaining to human rights from an idealistic western foreign policy perspective.  Ignatieff is a Canadian born foreign policy commentator who has spent the majority of his professional life in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Ignatieff's two opening essays are followed by observations from other commentators; which in-turn are followed by closing remarks from the author.  This type of discussion format is normally quite beneficial in helping readers to gain an appreciation of a given subject from a different perspectives.  Unfortunately, in this work the additional commentators are to close to the author's ideological view to be of any real value.  Dianne Orentlicher's observations were ok, however, the others were weak - characterized by too much flattery and self-aggrandizement.  The opening essays introduce a range of concerns within the contemporary human rights movement.  Ignatieff identified relevant concerns such as; the tension between individual and collective rights, the view that the human rights movement is a type of Western imperialism, whether secular human rights is a form of cultural relativism as well as the need to balance rights and security/stability.  I have heard the author speak on foreign policy issues and find him to be a generally capable foreign policy commentator.  Overall, there is not much of value in this book. If handled from a broader perspective these issues could be a worthwhile read.  In its current form, however, I do not recommend it. 
 This is one of the landmark Measurement books for Psychologists.  It does present a relatively comprehensive treatment of the issues facing researchers when developing measures.  Unfortunately, the style of writing used in the book makes it exceedingly difficult for students to extract the useful information from the chapters.  Specifically, the chapters are not particularly well organized - particularly the ones with fewer equations in them - often jumping back and forth between topics rather than presenting them more systematically.  Furthermore, the prose explaning concepts and equations is basically written in an overly complex and sometimes cryptic style more appropriate for mathematicians and psychologists from the 1950's than for graduate students or modern consumers.  I only bought the book to augment the graduate level measurement class that I teach and despite the fact that I have a solid background in mathematics, I grown inwardly every time I have to pick up a chapter in this book and read it 
 This Skip Spence Oar cd is really bad. To hear other peoples reviews it sounded like the best thing in the world. Its no wonder why this album was a flop when it came out. Thirty five years later it is not any better. 
 Considering that it's now been a year after the title date, and no comet has struck the Earth, let alone Greece (during the Olympics, yet), this book is a flop. Put a prediction and date in your title, trot out Nostradamus, and you may find that your audience expects results. To quote Marvin the Martian: "Where's the Kaboom? There was supposed to be an Earth-shattering Kaboom!".  Don't worry, I'm sure Welch will write another book with amended predictions. It gets a whole star because it's fun to check off the misses on major predictions as they pass 
 I have waited with barely contained anticipation for this book, only to be disappointed.  The first half was mostly very wordy, minutely detailed descriptions of barracks talk, how to march in review, what they eat/drink, discussions between various officers, etc.    When the story did finally get to some action, it wasn't much and not what one expects, even given the few hints in the first half of the book.  Also, I find it ludicrous that a government would try to keep the skinks secret from the governed.  I'm always very irate when an author or even someone in authority cites the possibility of "panic in the streets" as a reason for secrecy.  I doubt that very few of any populace would run into the streets, rioting and looting.  Rather, they would pull together to face this new threat to their collective civilization.  Throwing citizens into lifetime imprisonment, either military or civilian,  for knowing even a hint of these aliens existence, is a crime in itself.  That is totally outrageous government behavior  Not to mention letting their families and friends thus believe they are either dead or "missing in action".  That portion of these books is, I believe, very, very unbelievable.  It was a fair story, a somewhat quiet story, given it's military trend.  Even Sgt. Bass was treated as a minor character, once the "action" started.    However, it is a part of the series, and as such, should be read by anyone who is following these marines.  I await the next book and hope for some more of the "skink war".  If the government insists on keeping the existence of the aliens such a secret, other vulnerable populaces and planets are left without a clue to even be looking for signs of a skink presence on their world, so as to defend themselves and/or be alert and prepared.  I love these authors works, and am sorry to be somewhat down on this particular book, and will happily await the next 
 I love all of these songs, and I was really hoping this would be my "one stop" Elvis CD,  but I must say this CD was mastered poorly. It sounds tinny and hollow to me.  It seems they put "the King" front and center, and left the band behind.  His voice is clear and loud, but the music is way in the background, and in some places you can barely hear the band.  I'm no re-master expert, but I can tell when something sounds out of proportion.  Pass on this one.  I would not recommend.   
 I bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure.  I found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to.  I'm used to a 60 sec sweep. And the minute hand was difficult to read.  I really had to check to see if I was at 1.5 min or 2.5 min. 
 I would not recommend this video and wonder why it got so high reviews from other people.  The pace is way too fast and they change positions very often.  It was hard for me to keep up with all of the different positions as an adult.  I couldn't imagine how kids could.  The kids on the video must have practiced for at least a year so they could all be in sync.  I would recommend "Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids" by Rich Grogan if you are wanting a work out that kids can actually keep up with and is fun 
 If you were a Ludlam fan, and begin reading this book, you will be reminded immediately that he is dead.  How sad that a byline has turned into a trademark.   If you have a distaste for subtlety, and prefer ideas repeated and underlined in red, buy this book.  Shameful exploitation of a decent name 
 This is a wonderful idea, but is apparently before its time or the product designers didn't check with with the paper manufacturers.  It is easy to train the system to interpret bad handwriting, but accomplishing that, it is impossible to find replacement paper pads. The only replacement pads I have been able to find are steno pads and these don't have the same page/space productivity as the original paper which comes with the AceCad.  Either make replacement pads available or make the writing surface a different size to conform to writing pads that are more readily available 
 The overwhelming impression one gets when reading Pat Yale's contributions to this book are that here we have a woman who, due to her own ill-founded preconceptions, has almost completely failed to understand and appreciate the beauty of the culture into which she finds herself immersed. As a result, her comments regarding Iranian culture come across as being crude and disrespectful, often obnoxious, and even downright racist. Perhaps as a Westerner she cannot help being the way she is, but if that is the case, what on earth is she doing going to Iran in the first place, and what kind of an authority is she to write a travel guide?  For example, in the section on p.51 entitled "The Iranian Way of Life", we are forced, amongst other things, to put up with the unnecessary snide comment, "It's a rare husband... who would as much as carry a dirty dish to the sink, let alone do any housework" - now would this not just as aptly describe a typical British or American husband (perhaps even her own?), who would rather spend his evenings down the local pub with his mates - and who will later urinate on someone's wall on the way home, while singing loudly and hurling abuse at innocent passers-by? And then there are the ridiculous comments about rising divorce rates - which the author idiotically puts down to the existence of arranged marriages, failing completely to realise that the divorce rates in countries where arranged marriages are prevalent are MUCH lower than in the West where pre-marital sexual promiscuity is taken for granted. If she had half a brain, she would have reached exactly the opposite conclusion - that it is the gradual Westernisation of Iran that was leading to the increase in divorce rates (which is presumably one of the many reasons that they would rather do without the rapidly spreading disease of Westernisation - and if the satellite TV propaganda machine fails, there are always the bombs, eh?). And the section ends with the stereotypical and spitefully Islamophobic comment, "These days it's a rare man who can afford to take up his Islamic right to have four wives".  And she does rant on and on about the oppressive hijab that she has been forced to wear, and the segregation between men and women. Sadly for her, the author does not appreciate the beauty of a society in which modesty and piety are valued so greatly. Rather, the author (deducing that all Iranian men must be sexually repressed) expresses her surprise at not having been fondled! She did in passing mention the fact that she was treated with great dignity as a lone woman while queing for her visa extension, but apparently failed to see past her veil enough to realise that this elevated respect for women permeates the whole of Islamic culture. And she would do well to note that it is precisely this modesty  which makes arranged marriages work so well (in complete contradistinction to the misguided promiscuity and sexual freedom in the West, which effectively renders marriage meaningless and leads them to fail).  So the result is a book which is technically sound and reasonably comprehensive, interspersed with the most ourageous Islamophobic/Iranophobic Western hate propaganda - an irritating and unusual combination which leaves you wanting to kick [...] Perfect then, for your stereotypical FOX-News/CNN-educated American tourist, who probably should never have been let out of the country in the first place.  Until something better comes along (perhaps a new edition completely rewritten by someone who actually ENJOYS being in Iran and APPRECIATES its culture), then unfortunately this otherwise dubious piece of hate-literature remains a useful guide.  [If the spiteful comments get too much, simply striking through the offending paragraphs/pages with a thick black marker pen may help] 
 I'm an Afx user and found this book painfully basic. I bought it because it was recomended for high-end users which I'm sorry to say is a lie. The 'keying tutorials' arent even tutorials; they're just examples of what you can do with 3'rd party Plugins. If I wanted a demonstration in how to download plugins I'd visit my local Crack site, thank you very much 
 This book seems to cover all the necessary topics for the 70-536 exam, but the errors/typos are totally unacceptable. This is probably the most poorly edited book I've ever read. Repeated paragraphs, copy-and-paste errors, code that doesn't compile....you lose confidence in the book and when something doesn't make sense, I find myself wondering if I don't understand the concept or if it's just another error.  Again, if you can get past the errors, the book does cover all of the necessary topics.  
 Pullman has no understanding of Milton, actually he can do nothing but project his views on to Milton and Paridise Lost. This does neither he or Milton any good. I think if you want to read Milton then one should read Milton, I really think that after all these years he can stand on his own. But if you are impressed by the cover and the looks of a book, then this shallow self adualtion will do 
 i don't why anybody liked this book. the story line wasn't bad it was just that is was way to vague and not enough interaction with the characters. i mean there is hardly any conversation at all 
 dear readers I have not read any of these books before this one, but I have seen the movies. Odviously I loved them, so I wanted to read the series. When I bought this one I thought "o.k., mostly Marty and Clark." But when I started reading the first page my attention went elseware. THIS BOOK IS SO BORING THAT I DONT THINK THAT I CAN BARE TO FINNISH IT! No offence to the author, but I suppose that I, a teenager, am to young to appreciate the dull reminecences, the unimaginative dialog, and all of the deep southern accents. I am only on page 40 and I am looking for another book to read. So my advice to anyone looking for any action or plot in a book, is to pass this one up and see the movie (cringes as she says it, because she never says it)! I picked up this book thinking that it was a non-cheesy not dscriptive romance novel. But she spends eight times the time thinking and talking about herself than thinking and talking to Clark. I might have enjoyed this seiries if I had read about younger characters.  
 The premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.   I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum 
 ... or so we're told. A pity this is the exception to the rule.   All the elements that made the original Arthur great, especially the one-liners, the cinematic flow and feel of the movie, Arthur's irrepressible personality, and the naturalness of the absurdity, are all disposed.  The replacement is a series of hackneyed scenes, strung together in a formulaic and unbelievable setting. It suggests a film held hostage to its executive producer - the same Moore that was genius in the first movie - attempting to shoehorn a reality play and forced character development into an environment that was so charming due to its lack of either.  Three thumbs down if that is possible 
 I found this book extremely boring.  While there are few interesting parts, Rousseau found it necessary to relate detail after monotonous detail.  Composing over 600 pages, this book would of been less tiring given half the length.  
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 This is an example of Historically Informed Performance gone wrong....Joshua Rifkin's research into Bach's one voice per part (OVPP) choir is to be commended, whether it's true or not.  However, in terms of both interpretation and recording quality, one could not ask for a worse example of period instrument performance, or performance on ANY type of instrument for that matter.  The cantatas are played quite listlessly, very clean, every note in place....an attempt at perfection while sacrificing musicality and emotion.  The continuo is without imagination whatsoever, and the choral sound is consistently lacking warmth and presence.  Whether this is a consequence of using OVVP or just ineptitude on the part of the sound engineers is debatable.  Paul McCreesh uses OVVP to astounding effect, so perhaps it's the latter fault.  In any case, this recording gets two thumbs down for boring, turgid, overly academic performances of otherwise beautiful music; poor sound quality, analagous to a photo that's just almost in focus but a little fuzzy around the edges; and a total absence of feeling and emotion on the part of the instrumentalists and singers, and ultimately the director, Joshua Rifkin.  
 I have read books on both sides of the issue and Mary did not handle herself well though she fought hard.  . It was noted by other greek philosophers that Egypt was a land of blacks. So, Why did she forget to mention that part of history. Gerald massey among others were white scholars who mentions the same things as Bernal, Vansertima, Dr. Ben. So, why did she not take on the other white scholar. Seems to me she was only speaking out of frustration and anger.  On another note there are some crazy people out there that says the black man created every thing which is not true. Contribution was made by all including the Africans. 
 This is the second Myss product I've purchased so far.  I love her spin on reinterpreting our reality.  Though I wouldn't consider her a guru, her work carries much wisdom to it.  There is so much I KNOW I can glean from her studies.  That's the plus side.  The down-side is that she loses me, and frustrates me.  An awful lot.  Any time she has an aside, or a tangent story, she runs on into it without so much as a pause.  It's distracting and downright annoying, so much so that I could NOT finish listening to the last few hours of "Archetypes."  And I love her sense of humor, I really do, but I find myself saying "huh?" to things like this:  "Your own child archetype is critical for you to take a look at, for you to identify.  Are you a magical child, are you a Tarzan is a nature child for example.  There's very much of that need of of I have a friend in Scotland--hoof, you're not going to believe this, but this is absolutely true: they're very eccentric actually, but their son, this is so preposterous you are not going to believe this, I don't know why I'm going to share this story."  My head began spinning on that second sentence and I. Just. Got. Lost. I had NOTHING concrete to latch on to as a listener.  Maybe her rapport with the studio audience was *spot on*, or maybe it's just a physical thing (maybe you need to see her face to get those pauses).  But I CANNOT RECOMMEND the audio format of her talks.  I suggest anyone who is interested in the treasures Myss has to offer to read the text versions if possible.  I'm sorry to be so critical of the way someone SPEAKS, but I blame it on the fact that I purchased something that communicates its value through SPEECH.  
 I'm not surprised that someone with very little exposure to philosophical thought would find the arguments of this book convincing. The authors do a great job of employing misleading statistics and frequently resort to logical fallacies (petitio principii, mainly) in their arguments. This book is great if you want an anti-capitalist screed, but it fails miserably as an impartial analysis of business ethics. Like ssaber, I was disappointed to find a three page "defense" of capitalism and a ten page attack of it in Chapter 4, "The Nature of Capitalism." The authors include the views of a wide range of notable experts in this section, including but not limited to Karl Marx, George Soros, and Bertold Brecht (yeah, now there's a real authority on the subject). Why not include Sean Penn while you're at it, guys? I wasn't surprised to find that they'd skipped over real economists like Keynes, Hayek, and Friedman. 
 Well, first of all, if I were reading a book about kids, wanting to know about the society of children, I would want to know the author has done the work of raising kids, instead of studying documents of others who studied kids on a makeshift and very temporary basis. There's a great deal of difference between this "pop" psychology writer Hulbert and people who study children, like children, and look for what is good and workable. As I read this book, I kept thinking, how simple it is to write a book about what is wrong, and this is something Hulbert specializes in- according to her, lots of bad ideas exist in the world. This becomes tiresome throughout this book. In a world of cheap pundits everywhere, claiming that everything about everything is wrong, it is refreshing to read instead people like Derrida "the Work of Mourning" which speaks clearly about relationships and how they are made in individual psyches. I think overall, there is so much to be said about kids and relationships between them and with adults that is useful, that this book is unfortunately just is a rehash of each decades "look how bad and stupid people are after all" genre 
 To me, Richard Laymon's books read like early 80's slasher films.  Not exactly high-art, pretty misogonystic, and ultra-violent.  Some people, like me, like this type of film and book, but this one just doesn't really do it for me.  First of all, it's really two novels in one.  I kinda don't understand why that author just didn't make this into two books.  I think it would have worked better.  We don't need any Tarantino-esque plot melding in the literary equivalent of a Friday the 13th film.  Also, as with all of Laymon's novels, but especially in this one, the female characters are ridiculous.  They are always wearing next to nothing, they always want to have sex with strangers, they're always beautiful.  It seems like a lot of horror authors, especially Laymon, create female characters to be like what they wish most women were like.  I know it's "fiction" but come on.    Additionally, every time a character in the novel comes across another person, their first thought is that the other person is a serial killer rapist.  When I'm out hiking, or walking down the street, and I run across another group of hikers or pedestrians, I don't automatically think "thank god I brought my gun because these people are going to sodomize and mutilate my girlfriend."  Laymon must have been one paranoid guy.  I don't know, maybe it's just me.  It's also pretty slow and devoid of suspense until the end of the novel(s).  Nothing, and I mean nothing, (not even any successful character development) happens within the first 200 pages.  Also, the word "breast" or "nipple" appears at least once every three pages.  Seriously.  It's redeeming quality is that is does deliver the splatterpunk goods before all is said and done.  Still, not recommended. Pick up "Night in the Lonesome October" as a much better example of what Laymon is capable of 
 I found this book to be disgusting, and lacking any redeeming qualities or messages.  I agree with the reader who stated the language is shocking, only for other reasons entirely.  If you don't like trash, you won't like this book 
 Wasn't worth the subscription. I found the magazine to be bland, full of ads and basically boring. All the information can be found doing a quick web search. Highly Disappointed 
 Unlike Cussler's other series, I found this first story of the "Oregon Files" slow going at first and rather confusing. There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also, there's little to no character development even of "Mr. Chairman", Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes.  
 Despite the rave reviews for this product, I'm a bit more skeptical.  I recently purchased an HP LaserJet 3015 MFC and wanted to use this device to connect to our office network.  A couple of thoughts:  1. Toms Networking does a comparison between this product and Silex's SLX SX1000U.  I would strongly suggest anyone thinking about buying this product to read the article.  The article can be found at:  [...]  2. Although Silex's product only has one USB port, you *can* connect a USB hub to support up to 15 devices.  The KeySpan device supports 4 devices, but you cannot add more devices.     3. I found that the unit would experience problems if I submitted a print job greater than 7 MB through the KeySpan.  I reset the printer and nothing got fixed.  Only when I power cycled the KeySpan did things work.  I am using the latest version, v1.3.1, which also upgrades the KeySpan firmware.  4. Toms Hardware also reports that it would crash with several different devices.  I read on other web sites that the Keyspan software causes the blue-screen-of-death (IRQ_LESS_THAN_EQUAL errors), so I tend to believe that the problem is caused more by the Keyspan drivers than the HP ones.  5. In some parts of its web site, KeySpan advertises that this unit supports USB v2.0, but if you read the fine print it's supporting at USB v1.1 speeds.  6. I discussed with KeySpan about connecting external hard drives.  This unit is really meant for multi-function printers and cannot support external HD's.  7. I decided to return this product and try out the Silex instead.  Although there is a lot of potential for this device, I would not suggest it for enterprise environments.  I read the glowing Amazon reviews but would put more skepticism about their comments now that I have tried it for myself.  8. I will update this review later when I have a chance to try the Silex unit 
 Pipes' utter and complete disprespect of the russian people in general and communists in particular oozes out of every paragraph of this book. According to him, nothing, absolutely nothing good ever came out of the soviet union. Every action taken by the communist party was a complete failure. Communism turned the entire russian people into alcoholic slackers incapable of accomplishing anything. I can see exactly where President Reagan got his russophobia from. Don't waste your time with this book. To quote the Sting song, "...the russians love their children, too." But you wouldn't know it from this book 
 This book is short on practical "how to" advice on breastfeeding, and long on preachy passages that attempt to convenince all moms to stay at home and breastfeed until your child is 8.  I'm a working mom of 3 and have extensive experience with breastfeeding.  There are about 3-4 pages of this book that actually inform, and the rest is an attempt to pursuade mothers to stay at home and breastfeed the rest of their lives.  
 On page after page of this book, Western Imperialism shines through. It's over, Mr. Bell. The Empire is no more! I could not bring myself to finish this book. I was that offended by the apparent xenophobia and the preposterous plot 
 It's not clear to me what some of the other reviewers saw in this movie, or whether we even saw the same movie. A contrived story of revenge with a convoluted storyline, sex scenes with actors that must have been cheap at the time, and (admittedly a lot) of poorly shot violence make a poor mix. It looks really dated and just doesn't come together. Its music score seems to come straight from a 'Shaft' film, but 'Sex and Fury' is not half as funny. With so many excellent Japanese movies to chose from there is need to go there. Two stars is generous 
 I think this book is very repetitive and is a very poor attempt at showing why losing all of these languages is important.  They are comparing losing these languages to animals and plants going extinct.  They try and draw all of these worthless comparissions that do not make any sense.  This book is not even worth being picked up 
 The book is good, but at times it drags.  There are points where I would have preferred more information and points where you just want here to get on with it.  So far the whole mess with the Eika seems pointless, except to give them someone other than themselves to fight with.  She gives just enought hints and clues to interest most people, but the true fantasy reader will find her frustrating to some degree.  I would recommend the book, but I would be sure to warn people that it isn't the best work I have seen 
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life 
 One star is way to many for this SCHMUCK! As a French Jew I do not need to be dictated to by a member of the least worthy of Europes gentile population. The author made so many factual and editing errors that I am shocked that the publisher let it slip by. As others have pointed out the whole series "hinges Of history is bad revisionism." Do not waste your time or $ !!!!!! 
 After seeing all the glowing reviews of this book, I'm beginning to wonder if it's just me. I've only gotten through the first 3 chapters and already I've run into a multitude of terms that are not explained at all. My class uses this book for its text and I have to answer discussion questions about brand-intensive vs. capital intensive, disaggregation and reaggregation (Dictionary.com didn't even have 'reaggregation' in its database), etc. It sure would be nice to include a glossary of terms used. I'm really dreading the rest of this book 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 As a citizen from one of the countries in Africa, I found this book most overbearing. I confess I started to get prejudiced from the inception, when Herbst describes his arrival in the clouds, on the continent, and how he cast an eagle eye on us from the plane and began brooding about our fate. How godly!!! But I have learned to appreciate Western books on us as a portrayal of Western gaze, rather than a portrayal of our realities. As such, the book is interesting, although it reaches certain conclusions (decertifying states, dumping the Addis rules, all this under outside compulsion) that, given the current propensities of the American government, should be considered by any African patriot as extremely dangerous 
 Unless you're into spamming folks, who filter out junk mail anyway, you won't find much value in this book. Each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email (spam) campaign in order to get recognition (and thus advertise to the reader). 
 Just another book explaining Christianity to Christians using an easier to comprehend analogy than those contradictary fables in the new testament.  The title should be changed to "A Christian Introduction into how Christians misunderstand non-Christian worldviews 
 I had to read Annie John for my English class and I can say that it is probablly one of the worst books I have read yet.  Not only are the characters difficult to relate to, but the book is extremely dull and written as a comeing of age story. Basically, the book starts out with Annie, the protagonist a girl growing up in Antigua remembering how much her mother loved her when she was a young girl. Then, in the next few chapters, Annie describes herself as a 12 year old girl going to school and having an overpowering love for her friend Gwen.  She has behavior problems and does some things that her mother seems shamed about and she further distances from her mother. The next couple chapters, she is an akward 15 yr. old in classes with older girls who are more developed then she is as she puts it and she dislikes this.  At this time, her thoughts that her mother doesn't like her have escalated into her hating her mother and her thinking that her mother returns these same feelings.  She doesn't love Gwen anymore and feels lonely.  Finally, when she is 17 she leaves home and goes to train to become a nurse and oddly actually will miss her mother even though throughout the book (for the most part) she has shown strong resentment and hatred towards her mother....Anyway, this book was so extremelly horrible and I hope you don't ever read it. If you decide to read it or are forced to I pity you, because this book is trash and I don't see why anyone would publish it...BIG MISTAKE on their part.  
 I, too kicked myself for falling for the marketing hype that surrounds this mediocre book. As others have noted, the text is uneven, hints a multiple authors, and is based on little more than repetitions of various ideas from pop psychology and the current interest in law of attraction systems. Feel-good platitudes abound, but little else of any depth. The book has, unfortunately, about the same level of subject depth as an average website.  On a related topic, this book is an example of a very damaging trend in the publishing industry. Publishers can be wooed into printing a book entirely on the strength of the author's "platform" rather than any qualitative judgement of quality. If you have a big enough mailing list, and you can get a bunch of friends to write good Amazon reviews (see the early reviews of this book), you can get a book published no matter how poorly written.   The bright side of this is that I now recognize the techniques used to activate this so-called platform. In the future I will not fall for it 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 This book consists of 18 essays about various aspects of the history of the Times Square neighborhood. There are over 40 illustrations, mostly b&w period photos and reproductions of old theater programs, as well as one map. The drawback of collections of essays is that the reader never gets a chance to become comfortable with the tone or worldview of a single author. On the positive side, if one author is offputting, perhaps the next essay will be better, and it's impossible to dislike every essay of the book. Some of the essays are quite broad in topic while others are quite specialized (such as "The Syndicate/Shubert War" between two theater entrepreneurs in the early 1900s).   When so many authors are involved, it's hard to generalize about the book. To the extent that there is a theme, it is nostalgia for the pre-1990 era when Times Square was filled with criminals, beggars, and porn shops. For example, here is one of many negative comments about the Marriott Marquis hotel: "The hotel is a nasty piece of business .... [the hotel's design] seemed more deliberately arranged to sift out all but the most doggedly determined street people before they reached the eighth floor [lobby]" (p. 13). The complete context implies street people would be a positive addition to the lobby.  I have been to Times Square both before and after its revitalization, and I am mystified by the notion that porn theaters, junkies, and beggars are preferable to having the sidewalks jammed by respectable tourists seeing Broadway musicals. This is a strange form of nostalgia, indeed. For a much more balanced treatment of the topic, read "Ghosts of 42nd Street" by Anthony Bianco 
 Based on her own definition in this book, Ms. Coulter is liberal to the core. "If you cannot articulate your opponent's position, you are not an adult; you are a liberal."   Ms. Coulter is an articulate author with an admirable command of language. Her twists of the literary knife  are a pleasure to read, even when you realize that she has severed your necktie. Or your intestine. She has a penchant for making the same point three or five or six times using eight or twelve or twenty examples, which is about as pleasant as watching a pile driver hammer a steel rod into granite.  Her thesis is that the political opinions of mainstream American media are more liberal than those of mainstream America, affecting both the choice and treatment of news topics. She raises some cogent and disturbing points. Her opening  line, "Political debate in this country is insufferable," makes clear that she can and does address fundamental problems that transcend the issues of the moment.  She also identifies the cause of these problems in her first paragraph: "It's all liberal's fault." She judges the value of any action entirely by the political stance of the actor, regardless of the action itself. Liberals who characterize conservatives as "dumb" (i.e. every liberal, everywhere) are attacking their opponents personal traits because they are unable to create or express any meaningful arguments. She does not apply the same logic to her own statement such as "All liberals hate America," or "Liberals love pedophiles." She is certainly skilled in logic, as revealed in a hair-splitting analysis of why it is reprehensible for liberals to describe right wing ideas as "Nazi" in nature, but Rush Limbaugh's term "femin-Nazi" is a discerning and accurate characterization.  
 While this may have been technically impressive at the time it was written (1968), it doesnt really stand the test of time; if I had heard it without knowing it was by Terry Riley, I would have thought I was listening to a fairly average modern electronica piece. There is minimalist work that has aged better than this; for example "Tago Mago" by Can, and some pieces by Philip Glass and Arvo Part. In the realm of early electronica, Jean Michel Jarre's "Oxygene" blows Riley's work away despite being only recorded 5 years later.  The second piece (Poppy Nogood) is significantly more interesting than Rainbow imo, although both lack any real emotional depth 
 Graduating high school in 1990, I really can appreciate the whole hair metal thing. But unless your a hardcore "Slaughter" fan, they really were a two hit wonder. Not that they're so bad, it's just that they make "Warrant" and "Cinderella" seem amazing in comparison. Your best bet is to find their hit songs on a "Hair" collection, and hope that they're between a "Motley Crue" and "Skid Row" song. That should keep you up all night 
 I first heard Nadia Ali on a few tracks from Global Underground 29 - Sharam/Dubai (which I seriously recommend) which immediately made her my new favorite singer - so I bought this with great expectations, only to be really dissapointed. I can't imagine why she's working with this guy - sorry, he's a hack - these tracks sound like leftovers from Kylie Minogue's trash, and yes, I could do better. Avoid this at all costs & hope Nadia finds somebody with talent to work with ... yawn 
 This movie is intriguing because it was written by Billy Wilder and stars Dean Martin and Kim Novak. It may entertain hard-core fans and its subject matter was considered racy for its time, but the story never fully transcends conventional 1950s influences. 
 i agree with the other review. we have burned out 2 in a little over 6 months. 
 This complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone-star movie.  With cringingly awful acting, laughable special effects (the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment), appalling dubbed dialogue, cheesy music, inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere, The Grim Reaper is a total disaster.   Don't waste your money on this turkey. 
 Although not nearly as heinous as Richard Avedon's "In the American West", Stephen Shore's "Uncommon Places" earns an honored place in the annals of overrated art. Its sole interest is its time-capsule appeal.  Imagine if you will, taking a camera across America and shooting ugly buildings, roads, humble homes, and desolate scenery with nary a concern of cohesiveness or narrative. Make no attempt to include a theme, other than perhaps a New Yorker's condescension much like the lyrics in the Talking Heads song "The Big Country." You then have this book.   Perhaps 15-20 of these photgraphs hold some genuine magic. The rest are totally ridiculous. Much better is Eggleston's "Los Alamos."   Even the title is grating 
 I tried it and I didn't like it.  I'd almost say read my review of the X-files 9th season and just replace any character names and whatnot, but I won't.  As another reviewer stated this show should've ended after seven years.  Through the show's seven year run they had a cohesive  story that kept me coming back every week.  The ga'uld were an origional idea for a villian.  Apothis and Anubis being of course the stand outs.  I still think they should've had a bigger story involving so'car rather then just an episode or two.  Starting with their decision to make the lost city an ancient outpost and put Jack as a general the show just lost everything.  As boring as season 8 was it was still better than this.  When will TV executives get it?  End a show while it's still strong.  Unfortunately they love to milk a show for everything they can get.  I'd like to say props to scifi for canceling it, but they should've done that two years ago.  Of course Jack isn't on this season which adds to the crap that is season nine.  Add in some bad new characters, one of whom tries hard to be Jack it's not even funny, and a rediculous new villian and you have the makings of bad tv.  If they wanted to do this crap they should've created another bad spin off.  I wouldn't of watched it, but a lot of people would.  Oh and that's another thing, what's with all the atlantis references?  I personally don't care what goes on in another galexy on another bad tv show.  The writting has completely gone downhill.  I never finnished the memory altering device episode because ten minutes into it I figured everything except for who killed the girl, and I just don't care.  And what's with having another villian who pose as gods?  If you're going to create a new bad guy at least make them completely different.  Course the main bad guys on atlantis are basically vampires who liik like marolyn manson.  I could go on, but instead I'll just say if you haven't seen this season then just don't bother.  It's not SG1.  You can't take away three main characters over a couple year span, then take away your main bad guy, replace them with lame characters and expect it to work.  It just doesn't 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
 Good strategies in keeping a mate if you are into the cat and mouse game playing;  however, this book presents a clear bias in that it promotes the religious theme that a marriage should be saved no matter what.  The book also promotes denial and a sanctimonious platform for the person who wants to stay in the marraige when the leaving partner has made it clear it is over.  People who stalk their soon-to-be ex-spouse often use this book as a jusitification in the name of "fighting for the marriage."  Also, this book portrays the theme that the person who wants out of the marraige is less moral or worse than the person who wants to stay in.  A book for common people, not the more intelligent. 
 I love Pablo's act on Comedy Central.  This one doesn't even touch it 
 It's unclear for what audience this series of guidebooks is intended.  The first-time visitor will find them totally bewildering, while the seasoned traveler will inevitably quibble with the extremely quirky choice of locations included, none of which is marked on the rudimentary map on the inside back flyleaf.  The 100 tiny pages, presumably intended to fit into a trouser pocket or small purse, are largely devoted to photographs (attractive), but which reduce still further the space for actual travel information.  Wallpaper would have done much better to have merely collected in one place all the great restaurants, hotels, shops, and services featured monthly in the pages of their magazine.  Instead, only four shops are featured for a city as huge and varied as London!  The idea of reserving only one page for an alleged "insider" profile (once again with minimal "tips," none of them marked on a map) is an interesting "concept" but nearly useless to any traveler.  It would appear that Wallpaper's aim was to present each city as a "concept" rather than a series of useful, practical pieces of information (why then an entire section on "escaping" from the city, when you've hardly even discovered it?), but in the end it's mostly an interesting conceit that will appeal to devotees who don't really need another guidebook at all.  I religiously clip the tear-out travel pages in the monthly magazine; the recent page for London contains far more useful information for the traveler than this entire book (and has a useful map besides).  Wallpaper the magazine is a terrific treasure-trove of cutting-edge information for the on-the-go, in-the-know citizen of the world.  In reducing the format and the content, however, both the excitement and the utility have been pared away as well.  What could have been a stunning series is instead little more than a curiosity 
 Don't waste your money - this book contains misleading and incorrect information!  There are so many wonderful books on toddler development, don't waste your time with this one!  The author's have a very narrow mind and only give answers that support their idea on how to parent as opposed to addressing the range of normal development and issues that parents face. 
 My 18 month old received this as a gift for his 1st birthday.  I agree that the buttons are too hard to push, they work great if he steps on them.  It is indestractable, believe me he has thrown it, sat on it and stepped on it.  Problem is, he could care less.  We tried playing with him, naming the colors and shapes.  One shot through the line-up and he was off looking for something else to do.  In my opinion, it's just not interesting enough 
 Betty's voice is still strong and beautiful but arrangements of most beloved songs are simply horrible.   If you prefer traditional versions this concert is not for you.  The quality of image and sound is very good.  Can be recommended only to hardcore fans 
 After reading this book's description I really looked forward to sitting down with it . . . and was terribly disappointed when I did. Unfortunately this tale runs out of gas in less than 100 pages, which is doubly unfortunate as the book goes for over 200 pages. There really isn't much of a mystery, the plot is contrived and simple, the characters are wooden and one dimensional and the flavor of Ireland advertised on the cover is no more than a few scenes in a few pubs. To me this read more like a made for TV movie script, (How to Write a Mystery in 3 East Steps), rather than a novel. This one didn't work for me.  
 This is a poorly written, out-of-date book which would be devastating to any parent of a child recently diagnosed with autism. It presents a picture of despair and hopelessness which isn't even accurate. Copies should not  only not be bought, they should be destroyed 
 Read Code Complete by Steve McConnell. You don't need this book. It contradicts itself on several occasions and is totally wrong on others. It's unfortunate and sad how many organizations want to adopt texts like this as their "coding standard". A pamplet-sized book of bullet-points can't make developers competent, but a comprehensive manual of the best in software engineering practices like Code Complete can 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever bought.  I had to buy it for a college course and I am furious that my teacher used this one.  It is totally unprofessional and too general. Not only myself but others have complained about the  boringness and also but find it completely useless. It reads like a high school essay project with unnecessary sarcasims, endless repetition and examples that are really very weak and inept in the explanations.  If you are seriously considering pursuing an interest in compensation and benefits, do not use this book. Teachers: don't put any other students through the aggrivation and insult.  We are professionals looking to advance our careers not waste what little time we already don't have.  It infuriates me that I had to pay so much for a book that isn't worth $13.00 never mind $103.00 
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 Books have been written, and will continue to be written, to try and disprove Christianity and Jesus as the Son of God. What is almost comical is that one has to print lies and errors to try and convince people. That's because you can't disprove the TRUTH. And what are some of the errors, you ask? I will give you a few: Dan Brown tries to use Gnostic gospels (gospels written in the 2nd century and beyond by people who were not eyewitnesses) to try and prove his theory and omitting New Testament Scripture. To say that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married by using the Gospel of Phillip (written after 250 A.D.) where there are missing words: And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] more than [...] the disciples, [...] kiss her [...] on her [...]. Clearly, there is some problems with this text with the missing words and the fact that it was written over 200 years after Jesus died. This does not prove anything. Also, he says that the word "companion" means spouse in Aramaic, which is great, except that the Gospel of Philip was written in "Coptic," where "companion" does not mean "spouse!" Second, Dan Brown says that it wasn't until 325 AD at the Council of Nicea did people start to believe Jesus was a Deity and that it was a close vote. New Testament disproves that because it shows that Jesus was Deity where Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5: "For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve." Also, The Council of Nicea met only to sort out some differences among church leaders, all of whom believed that Jesus was divine. The main question was whether Jesus was begotten or made. Jesus' divinity, death and resurrection were not in question. Only two of 318 clerics at the Council did not sign the Nicene Creed. So there was not a close vote unless you think 318 to 2 is close! Third, his main argument is that it Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper painting by Leo. If that were true, then where is John, the youngest and most beloved apostle? John was often portrayed in a feminine manner to convey youth, as is seen in many stained glass portraits in European cathedrals. And also, Leo was just a painter who was not around when Jesus was, so it didn't matter if he tried to put Mary in a painting or not! Fourth, Brown says that The Gnostic gospels and the Dead Sea Scrolls are "the earliest Christian records." While the New Testament obviously came before the Gnostic gospels, The Dead Sea Scrolls refer to a collection of about 900 documents, many of which are fragmentary scrolls written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic, that were discovered in a cave and do not contain even a single mention of Jesus or of any other person mentioned in the New Testament as they are Jewish documents! He also says they were discovered in the 1950's when they were discovered in 1947. Oops! Fifth, Dan Brown says that Christianity borrowed its beliefs from the pagan religion of Mithraism. He says that Mithraism worshipped the pre-Christian God Mithras, called the Son of God and Light of the World, who was born on December 25th, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. Scholars of Mithraism would strongly disagree with Brown on all of these points. Nowhere is Mithras given the title Son of God and the Light of the World. Brown apparently made this up because it sounded good. Mithras was born on December 25th, however this proves nothing. The New Testament never associated December 25th with the birth of Christ. The early Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Christ on this day intentionally to oppose the pagan mid-winter festival of Saturnalia. They never claimed Jesus was actually born on that date. The claim that Mithras died and was buried in a rock tomb is just not true. Scholars will tell you that in Mithraism there is no death of Mithras at all. So, there was no rock tomb and no resurrection. So once again, he is nowhere near correct. Lastly, Brown says that the four canonical gospels were chosen from over 80 gospels. First, there were only less than half that many books written about Jesus life. The two Gnostic gospels Brown relies on most heavily weren't written until the second century A.D., long after the New Testament gospels were written. It makes sense that the Gnostic gospels came about in the late second century, as this is when Gnostic thought was most prevalent. However, the New Testament was complete before the end of the 1st Century. Also, the Gospel of Thomas, which Dan Brown lies heavily on,claims women must become men in order to receive salvation. That makes no sense. There are many other errors in this novel, but I think I have showed there are enough lies in this book not to be taken seriously. This is pure (or rather "poor") fiction, without a shred of evidence that Jesus was anything other than the Christ, the Son of the living God! Thank you, Dan Brown, for making my faith stronger!  Oh yes, and the music is subpar 
 I read Mr. Harris' book while on the way back from China, after studying  in Beijing as an exchange student. Reflecting upon my experiences in China,  I was amazed at how Mr. Harris distorts the truth. Almost everything he  says in the book is incomplete or distorted. If anyone wants to know more  about China and its people, the best way is to go and visit, and see for  himself. The worst he can do is read Mr. Harris diminutive lies. I regret  my parents wasted their money to buy this book for me 
 I was very appointed when I finished this book. The book is not meant for advanced brewers and did not explain any chemical reactions of the brewing process at all. The author even makes a few errors while explaining the  proces of brewing. The chapter of offflavours is slightly interesting. My  opinion: if you want to buy a goof book on advanced brewing techniques buy  the book An Analysis of Brwing Techniques from Fi 
 This book was written ( I bet)by unpaid graduate assistants. I borrowed it from the library to read before mr Fukuyama's arrival to speak at a university. The book was "written to order" to appeal to American conservatives. If Mr Fukuyama had really wanted to write about the construction/maintenance/increasing/decreasing of TRUST he could not have pointedly ignored the European Union. Nations and peoples with a thousand or more years of organised warfare are now at peace and trying to work together now that's an exercise in TRUST BUILDING. I asked Mr Fukuyama why, as the book doesn't have America in the title, did he only mention distrust in medieval Italy and not the phenominal TRUST required to bring Germans, Brits and the French together. His reply "Oh .. people always want me to talk about their country. Next question." well!.... I feel that this book is a dis service to Americans because as with so many political/cultural and economic books from the USA what is left out of the book adds to the hurly burly spiral of disinformation accepted as the truth about the world by many Americans and esp. uncrital conservatives. I am, of course by my own reckoning, a conservative - a mixed economy democratic christian from the U.K.(OK OK New Labour) So I am not hostile to the US, but this type of book and the supportive reviews sadden me. Good luck America and PLEASE read wider and TRAVEL 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 This is a chick flick through and through.  I agree that its lack of intensity make it a movie you could play as a side show in your living room while entertaining friends over popcorn.  However, it's way too long and though Amanda Peet's a dish, she needs acting lessons.  Jack's the best!  . . . this was beneath him.  And sorry casting consults, Diane Keating doesn't cut it as a playwright.  Oh, and one other thing, I'm done with Ebert & Roeper.  This movie did not deserve "Two Thumbs" - No way 
 I bought this book because it says it explains both the BS1 and BS2.  Only a couple of pages at the beginning are dedicated to explain the Most Basic commands of both BS1 & 2.  Almost the rest of the book are complex example programs (projects) with a LOT of commands which were not explained before.  I don't recommend this book, specially if you're planning to use other than the BS1.  It would have been a much better book if the author dedicated more time explaining all the commands and what they do, instead of putting so many examples which are hard to understand without this knowledge 
 This is one of these books that I would love to pretend to have read and enjoyed. Alas, pretending is not my forte. I would read this book only if I were forced to. Try the Christopher Vogler version instead 
 It worked quite nicely until after about 9 months the display just stopped working.  Changed the batteries to no avail.  It's very pretty, but I have a less attractive old Tanita that does body fat measurements which has been working for 5 years 
 The book is nothing but different tales about being a cop and their weird personalities wound around a very uninteresting story. Please tell me it aint you, joe 
 O'Leary made an honest effort to provide insights into the mechanics of apocalyptic reasoning. Moving from definitions of apocalypse and rhetoric, O'Leary extracted three basic topoi: time, evil, and authority.  By means of a case study of the Millerites and Hal Lindsey's writings, O'Leary gave  the three topoi a home in the tactics of persuasion of Miller and Lindsey.  Though the subject matter is a timely one, the book does not appear  accessible to everyone. This scholarly written book includes intense  philosophical and literary discussions and presumes one to be acquainted  with rhetoric.  However, for the scholar who can follow the flow of the  argument the application seems rather trite.  Yet for the layperson the  application seems of utter interest but the discussion of methodology and  the foundational presentation of apocalyptic reasoning seems beyond grasp 
 OK, it's been a while since I've read this book, but I remember almost feeling tingles when I heard about it...I too, have thought that physics is the meaning of life, and I ADORE any considerate mediation on  relationships, but alas this book was horrible.  It may have been a huge  letdown because I was looking forward to it so much as I LOVED "The  Passion" and "Written on the Body".  I found this book to be  entirely tooooo tangental and poetic words leading into boxed up nothings 
 The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient "toltec" wisdom.  It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications.  Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein.  
 After all the fantastic reviews, I was incredibly excited to get this book; and turned out to be incredibly disappointed.  You must have to be a raging fan of Amy Sedaris to think this book is worth more than a few chuckles 
 I have had this item since January, and it broke down today. It worked well while it did, but there is no way this product should have broke this soon 
 ... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics 
 Its an interesting read, but far from scholarly, and I certainly would never use it as a reference in a scholarly discussion. However, the humor makes it worth the price. But back to criticism...  One of the frequent quotes cited from Harwood is on the physical appearance of a historical Jesus. He paraphrases an impossible to verify 'work' of Josephus. But even the Testimonium Flavianum, which is another Josephus passage of far more credibility has proven itself an unlikely source of extra-biblical Christian evidence, and probably a pious interpolation. Yet in Harwood's mind this and far less compelling conjecture is good as gold. I'd recommend the interested reader find a decent translation of the meagre texts drawn upon by scholars and would-be scholars and make their own judgement. Still, unless some great archaeological discovery is made in the future, there's very little to be added to Abrahamic scholarship that isn't composed as simple polemic. 
 When I bought this book I thought I was buying a book that would help me teach my parrot to talk. Although I do know that there are no guarantees about which bird will talk and what method works, I wanted tips and advice on how to help my parrot learn.   This books gives no such information. It covers why parrots talk, which parrots talk and lots of stories about talking parrots, but no real information on teaching my bird to talk. The only chapter I liked was the one about the Model/Rival-method, which is a detailed chapter on teaching a parrot to talk with cognition, understanding the words it uses. However, the bird must alredy be talking for this method to work.  What I wanted was an answer to these questions: Do constant, out of context, repetitions work? Does plaing a casette work? Would it help to have talking sessions? Does my tone of voice matter? How can I get my bird to talk more clearly? How can I get my bird to talk in front of strangers 
  I suspect that the phrase mentioned in the title of my review (which I saw in the description of the product) was Amazon's idea since most (if not all) of the label information is easily found on Nature Made's own website  www.NatureMade.com.    There you will find that several of the components are synthetic (not necessarily bad, but I like to know), and also that Amazon is near the top in selling price of the 6 listed online retailers for this particular product.    Ain't it just amazing what the web can teach you?   Thanks Amazon! :)  
 I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!  Now, on to my review of The Ghost and the Darkness on DVD.  I remember wanting to see this movie when I was younger (when it was first released), but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I bought the DVD in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history. In terms of Hollywood, it's fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I'm a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they're fine here, but they've definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too.  Now the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL. I was mortified when I popped it into my player, only to be rewarded with a distorted image. Absolutely shameful...This film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio.  VIDEO: C- AUDIO: A FILM:  B 
 If you think this is a new title, beware.  It is a new title on an old text: Picture Book of the Continental Soldier (Stackpole Books, 1969). The contents are dated, i.e, the hunting shirt pattern bears no resemblance to the original at Newburgh, NY Washington's HQ, research shows the cooking gear was more like tin buckets than iron pots, the cartridge pouches became standardized during the war, enlisted mens tents are not as they are pictured, the Pickering musket tool was probably never made as none have ever been found, etc...  For the 1960's this book was pretty good, but 30+ years of research contradicts much of what this book pictures as being typical Continental soldier equipment 
 This short read was assigned for one a course that I am taking this semester, and frankly, it took all of my willpower to keep from chucking it across the room by book's end.    The author, while very cogent in his points regarding social satistics and the innumeracy of the public (which is why I gave this book two stars instead of one), has an obvious agenda: point out the flaws of the statistics wielded by "advocates."  What kind of advocates you may ask?  Oh, just anyone who supports abortion, the poor, women, minorities, and glbt rights, for starters.  His basic examples of mutant statistics were repeatedly one-sided.  Where are the countless examples of conserative AND liberal politicians who repeat mutant statistics to convince the public that their particular stance is the "right" one?    The title of this book promises to untangle "numbers from the media, politicians, and activists."  The media is mentioned casually as a dissemination point for mutant statistics to gain a larger audience, politicians are barely mentioned at all, and the remaining 95% of the book focuses on activists/advocates.  Mr. Best asks us to think "critically" about social statistics.  What I think he really meant to say was "conservatively. 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 I think the book was too difficult to understand for the average layman without an understanding of logic. The author must have been a genius 
 This video is so not worth the price! It is stills or ONE george book being read by a narrator and some other non Curious george stories as well. Buy you child the Movie they just made and the Zoo DVD which is what runs on PBS. I'm sure there will be more George on DVD in the furture 
  Physical labor sucks.  Okay, you know that, I know that, even Paris and Nicole (thanks to their reality show) have gotten it through their puny little brainage, but it's news to Barbara Ehrenreich, whose previous stints as Ph.D earner, activist and writer did not expose her to the grubby working world of dirty hands and aching muscles that most of us have managed to live through.   It's a shame. This could have been such a great book, but B.E.'s got a preconceived agenda (welfare reform is never gonna work!) and an axe to grind (unless we raise minimum wage to 14 bucks an hour!).  To prove her point she goes undercover for the better part of a year, taking entry-level, low-skilled work while staying in expensive short-term housing. Of course, she could of just crunched numbers -"Let's see, 7 bucks an hour times 40 hours, while my pretend rent is $200 a week...carry the zero...nope, can't afford it" - but that would have just given her a puny little 2,000 word article for Mother Jones.  Book deals, on the hand, require more work, more commitment, but think of the royalties, so off she goes, just like Paris and Nicole, to work as a waitress, maid and Wal-Mart associate.  At least until it gets too hard.  B.E.'s got a litany of complaints - my feet hurt, my back hurts, piss tests are demeaning, my boss is a jerk, customers are rude, my back huuuurts - and seems to think that only the minimum wager has to suffer such indignities.  News flash, Barbara!  Every job is stressful in its own way.  I'm a RN and it's a rare day I don't come home feeling like I've been beat with a stick.  I've been verbally abused and cussed out more times than I can remember, and that's just by the docs.  I've been pee'd on, poo'd on, run ragged, and called  "girl" by my stupidvisor (My response: I'm older than you, and I've had sex, and I'm pretty sure you haven't by the looks of you, so, boss, who's the "girl" here, and who's the WOMAN.)  I will admit I get paid significantly more for my putting-up-with-BS than the average Walmartian does for his.  But then again I earned a college degree, I had to pass a difficult competency test and I work under the constraints of my nursing license, for which I had to get fingerprinted and background checked.  So that's why I get paid more than a minimum wager, even though our jobs, probably 97% of the time, are comparable.  I'll give B.E. 2 stars for her writing.   It's smart and witty and at times, she borders on hilarious, especially when she's mocking the minorities and poor that she claims to want to help.  Hey, I didn't say she was compassionate, I said she was funny.    B.E., if you're reading this, consider this angle next time you want to write a book about not getting by.  Write a book about being poor and uninsured.  Write a book about wanting to advance your position in life, but not being able to, because as soon as you take that better paying job or go into business for yourself you'll be kicked off medicaid, and you'll run out of inhalers for your asthmatic kid, and you'll have to listen to him wheeze all night, and when you take him to the charity clinic a week from Tuesday, because that's the only time the retired charity doc can see you, you won't be able to afford the prescription since it's over a hundred bucks for one inhaler, so then you have to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid.  Then when you're done with that, write another book, this time about the lack of decent public transportation in the majority of the U.S., and how this results in needing a car to survive, which leads to excessive personal income spent on cars, more tax money spent on roads and highways, to say nothing of the hidden costs of car accidents and obesity from driving everywhere because it's too dangerous, with all the cars on the road, to ride a bike.  Those books would be worth reading.   
 We are a group of fourth graders from Mrs. Larson's class at Sunset Hill School in Lawrence, Kansas. Most of us thought parts of this book were boring. We thought the ending did not close out the story well. We felt there was something else going on in the story that the author didn't tell  us. The illustrations did not stand out and were difficult to understand.  If you looked at the illustrations they would not make you want to read the  book because they looked so sad. We also didn't like the story because the  characters had too much anger. We also thought the story should have a  happy ending. As it was it felt like the author had just stopped in the  middle of the story. Some people might enjoy this book but we didn't 
 If you read the dedication, you understand why she wrote this book.  However, she has placed too much emphasis on her agenda, and that really distracts from the hetero relationship of the book.  Like another reviewer below, I love her books, but don't think this is her best romance novel.  I really didn't care about either person in the hetero relationship, and was far too distracted by the other relationship in the book.  I understand that she may want to promote understanding and compassion for gay relationships, but I don't read romance novels to get schooled in liberal thought (and didn't need an education in broadmindedness).  I read them for hot, steamy hetero couples.  Frankly, I didn't like the setting for this one (a movie stage), either.  The last time she did a book based on acting/the stage ("Heart Throb"), I was equally unimpressed.  I thought the male lead was wimpy, which is why I'm such a fan of the Seal books she has done.  This Seal book is definitely a let-down 
 Sorry, but this is ok I guess if you want to do a lot of reading and listening to repititive talking.  This guy obviously has recorded (at low audio quality) a class he has taught  many times before, and it is quite tedious. The jokes are not very funny, he has a nasal voice, and you can hear the students in  his class on the cd (laughing at this not so funny comments).  There's no music and then chimes some bell or something, which is very distracting.  The book is very pretty if you want it to be a piece of coffee table dust, but I would reccommend a very calm audio-musical CD versus this CD (try Stephen Halpern or a number of other good yoga/ meditationg music and /or nature cds).  A much better, simpler, to the point book is Meditation for Busy People Barnes and Noble 
 I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it 
 Every young woman's experience with cancer is different so this account is useful from that perspective.  But as a young survivor I found it very ego-centric and not at all relateable. Is it tragic that she got breast cancer - yes.  Is it more tragic that she got breast cancer AND she's "pretty" and married to a doctor and knows people whose names we recognize - no.  While I acknowledge that body image and issues of sexuality and attractiveness seem to be more acute the younger a woman is - this book never develops beyond the surface.  Being someone that is not interested in "It" girls (or guys) to begin with - her "it" experience with breast cancer is also lack-luster for me 
 Well, i rented this from the video store, and i am awfully glad i used a coupon to do so! this movie could have been so much better.  Summary: Single dad Ashe and his son Danny witness a murder. Following their bosses orders to not leave any witnesses, the thigs murder the two, then throw their bodies in the harbor. Ashe comes back to avenge his and his sn's death. He's helped by Sarah, who i think is supposed to be the orginal Sarah from the orginal movie. Eventually, Ashe goes up against Judah, the very odd drug lord.  What i liked: Well..not a lot honestly. The look was pretty cool, and the first part had me watching. Sybil, the blind girl, was interesting. And i liked the moments with the little girl, Grace. I was glad to see Sarah was in this.  What i didnt like: the story just didnt grab me after a while. to be honest, it seemed like the screenplay writer was a bit confused as to what to do between Ashe and Sarah. you could tell had Ashe not be doomed to go back to the dead, there might have been a relationship. But that just wouldn't have fit. The bad guys were pathetic, except for Kali, she was pretty good. Even Judah. It seemed they tried to make him almost godlike, and that dosn't work very well.  Sarah: she was weaker then i thought she'd be. I mean, if thats the Sarah from the orginal, then they changed her.   Its worth a look, since it's the second movie, but i wouldn't buy it. Rent it from the video stor 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 I am a graduate student at the University of Harford. I havejust finished Intro to Neurophysiology. The text, Fundamental Neuroscience was definately not "FUN". The text was hard to follow, too many  unnessary details, and figures that were to complicated to follow. Also,  there was no space in the margins to take notes, and the summaries were as  weak in descriptions as the chapters. I gave the text one star because  hopefully this summer I'll have a lot of bugs to kill, a 100 bucks for a  fly swatter is a bargin these days 
 Hmm...a Call of Cthulhu silent film.  Sounds interesting.  Sounds like everyone loves it..  It just isn't very good.  I was more or less in agony watching it and by the end I actually felt a bit ripped off after it was over.  It's just so low budget and it just plain doesn't work.  Cthulhu in particular was disappointing.  The whole film felt like a sort of "test film" to show investors...not a finished product 
 I have never read an Iris Johansen book that I didn't like...until this one. The characters were never developed and were unbelievable. Sophie is supposedly a genius researcher and a doctor. MacDuff is a Scottish laird who's background we never learn about. Two gorgeous killers who we're supposed to empathize with. The list goes on.   I forced my way through the book, what a waste of time. I'll think twice before I read another one. Hopefully this was an anomoly 
 Never could get this to work with Windows Media Edition. After hours of trying and multiple tech support contacts from Creative I finally got a smart tech person to say "We don't make drivers for Windows Media Edition for your webcam It won't work." Not up to speed. Don't buy from Creative Labs 
 When I bought this book, I wasn't exactly sure what the author's viewpoint would be, but expected a fairly rigorous treatment on the history of church & state issues in America.  I thought this might lead to some meaningful conclusions.  To say the least, I was disappointed.  This is a work which is long on rationalizations, but short on rationale.  Meacham largely sidesteps the critical questions and instead wallpapers over them with anecdotes about the support that presidents and other leaders have given to expressions of "public religion".  He seems to build his whole case out of historical inertia rather than a clear-headed and logical analysis of law.  Meacham points demonstrably toward the fact that presidents have consistently expressed their religious beliefs in public, but completely ignores the reality that those are the kind of people who get elected to national office.  Is someone with strong non-theistic leanings likely to become Commander-In-Chief?  Of course not.  It is important to recognize, however, that this is a bias which is built into the political climate, not the Constitution.  Yes, there is a longstanding history of infusing religion into the public sphere, but this hardly supports the author's contention that it would be impractical for things to be any other way.  He only demonstrates the limits of his imagination and vision.  If he offered a strong case for his views, that would be one thing, but he largely obfuscates the most important questions by offering a collection of stories which really doesn't make much of a point.  In the end, if you're looking for tales about the religious perspectives of various presidents, give this book a read.  The content is hardly riveting, but you may find a few points of interest.  If you want an objective analysis and detailed exploration of the issues which divide our nation on the question of separation of church and state, you won't find it here. 
 This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.    It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover "I'll Be Home for Christmas", "Winter Wonderland" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.  That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  "Whatever Happened to Christmas", "Christmastime" and her original "Calling on Mary".  I also liked the fact that she covered "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch".  That seems to suit her more.  Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars 
 The play "Into the Woods" not only contains sinister elements, but has an overall dark message to convey.  It preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine.  It teaches is that lying, stealing, cheating, and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one's perspective on life.  Also, that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you.  This religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs 
 STAY AWAY!  Amazon sent me 1 bag of coffee pods. 18 pods in total, NOT pack of 12 like advertised. Unless you want to pay $30+ on 18 generic coffee pods, STAY AWAY. I will be returning my product ASAP 
   While it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I cook Korean food regularly but decided to check out some cookbooks for improvement.  This book is a joke.  Almost every receipe requires MSG (an unhealthy shortcut to authentic cooking). And almost every recipe requires Japanese products like Mirin and sake.  Koreans take national pride in their food (developed over 5000 years) and repeated reference to the cooking style and ingredients of its recent past colonizer was rather offensive.  The book also mentions dishes most Korean have never heard of; doesn't specify the time for certain steps; and uses ingredients that don't even grow in Korea or don't belong in the dishes.  I think the book was geared to Japanese people who want to dabble in Korean cooking -- if you want to cook Korean food the way Koreans cook it, this book is not it 
 Rosemary Wells' book entitled Felix Feels Better is one of our family's new favorites.  I went to the book store seeking out more of her books.  I thumbed through this one and thought it looked really cute so I bought it.  It wasn't until I got home that I read the phrase, "Nora!" said her sister, "Why are you so dumb?" repeated several times in the book.  Name calling of any kind is not practiced in our house and I was disappointed to find this in the book.  This is also not a book that my son's teacher would read in class for the same reason.  I will be returning it to the book store.  Very disappointing 
 Unless you like watching a girl clean for two hours... then don't see this movie. Other than the beautiful scenery, nothing was explained, there was hardly any dialogue, there was barely a plot, so if you didn't read the book then forget about understanding the movie. It is a complete bore!! I usually don't give movies bad ratings, but this is THE worst movie I ever saw! However,the book was amazing. Read the book. DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE.  
 This book is silly, silly.  It has an obvious agenda, one that overtly perpetuates "la leyenda negra" (the black legend).  Also, if so many Latin Americans are going to express such anti-European (Spain) sentiments, then why do they call themselves "Latino?"  The Latins (Latinos) are those from Latin Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Southern France) - if so many Latin Americans feel so "anti-European" then why not come up with another name for themselves?  For an "actual," "balanced" history of Latin America, read Donghi's book... "A Contemporary History of Latin America."   
 DO NOT order.  They only placed an order for 7 months but I got billed for 12.  After 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it.  After pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but cannot extend the subscription.  Only order from the magazine itself 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 At 163 pages, "Wildlife" is more of a novella than anything else and about as dry as the scorched Montana landscape.  The biggest problem is not so much the story, but the way the story is told.  In some cases, the impersonal first-person narrator works, as in "The Great Gatsby", but in others like "Wildlife" or "A Prayer for Owen Meaney", the narrator is such a nonentity that they don't add anything to the story and act only as a buffer that prevents the audience from really getting to know the other, more important characters.  The story, if you don't know, is that when narrator Joe's father loses his job as a golf instructor, he goes into the forest to help fight a wildfire.  While he's gone, Joe's mother has a fling with an older local businessman, Warren Miller, but whether this was already going on before Joe finds out is unclear.  When Joe's father returns from the fire, his mother moves out for a while.  And that's it.  In this case Joe (complete with dull name) has no friends, no ambitions, and few (if any) opinions to share.  He's no one I could ever care about, because his only function seems to be as a recording device to report the activities of his parents to us readers.  The parents, as though aware of this, speak in an unnatural way to always indicate to us what they are feeling or thinking.  It's the problem I've had with all of Ford's books, including the Pulitzer-winning "Independence Day".  Some writers are able to write convincing dialogue and others (like Ford) are not.  It's hard to say much about "Wildlife" because there's so little to it.  There's not a lot of action, drama, or passion and the story itself isn't much that we haven't already seen before.  Again, the story told through Joe the buffer keeps us from really learning anything about the characters and that prevents us from feeling sympathetic towards their plight.  It's hard to feel sorry even for poor Joe, because he's so without distinguishing features to his personality.  I've said this before about similar cases of first-person stories using a bland narrator--which always prompts other people to reach for the "Not Helpful" button--and that is that the story would have been more interesting either in first-person focusing on one of the parents or in third-person and focusing on both, so that we weren't so buffered from everything.  What makes Ford's Bascombe novels "The Sportswriter" and "Independence Day" so much better than his other novels is that we learn just about everything about Frank Bascombe and he is the center of all the action of the story, so that even if he is emotionally detached, it's easier to feel sympathetic towards him as a reader.  This can't be said for this dry little book.  If I hadn't bought this book for about as little as you can realistically pay without stealing it and if it were longer, then I would give it 1-star for wasting my time and money.  But I'll give it a bonus star for not wasting either one.  Now go reach for the Not Helpful button, I command you 
 Why two stars?  Because there is a perverse joy that comes with reading this slim volume of new age hogwash.  People buy into this?  Hey, I've got a bridge to sell ya, too.  I did the exercises, they didn't work 
 it's a waste of money. you can substitute it for any piece of plastic if you have carpet. if not, don't buy it 
 I clearly did not understand this book at all. I read it based on a recommendation of a scientist I work with who said it was an incredible read, but this came out as one lame novel. Maybe it's because it was written for a previous generation of reader, but Adams's novel doesn't really do anything all that exciting. The premise is intersting enough, Arthur Dent being a human being who is saved from the destruction of the Earth because of the need to build an intergalactic highway. Some of the details are also fascinating (and what saves the novel from being 0 stars in my eyes), especially the way religion and technology are described in such a satirical form, but the book iteself is poorly written, choppy, and frankly unentertaining. If someone can tell me what I was supposed to get out of this novel, please pass the information along.   I really do think that my negative views towards the book stem from it seeming dated in my eyes and how the humorous and sarcastic tone coming out as something quite standard in today's writing world. Maybe the novel was a breakthrough when it came out for the way it viewed the world and the way Adams pokes fun at almost everything, but none of this can cover up the fact that in my eyes, this seems like a poor, finished product, one that relies on its somewhat interesting satirical moments to cover up its other flaws. 
 The black cut outs aren't cut acurately.  I'd like to return this item to you and exchange it. A group of us purchased it for a class and I DON'T KNOW the account number. So how do i get it back into the mail and maybe get one that has been cut acurately?  Thank yo 
 Very dissapointing.  The inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims 
 An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last 
 This novel sucks. That's all I'm going to write about it 
 Typically Penguin Classics does a great job with translating foriegn classics, but in the case of Madame Bovary, they do not.  I read two chapters in this book and had to keep going back and re-reading sentences and had the most difficult time trying to figure out what was trying to be conveyed.  Finally, I drove over to my local library and checked out the Bantam Classics version and I am extremely pleased that I did.  It reads so much better and is actually entertaining.  Get the book, but get Lowell Bair's translation 
 I usually get both the Lonely Planet and Rough Guides for my trips, and generally both are good. In this case there is no comparison, and I would recommend just getting the Rough Guide. It's 585 pages compared to Lonely Planet's slim 332 and contains much more detailed information. The fourth edition of the Rough Guide (May 2003) is even less expensive! And where Lonely Planet usually wins, in color photographs and maps, the Rough Guide has at least caught up. I do like Lonely Planet's giving phone code and population for each city/town/village, but that alone doesn't make it worth carrying around 
 I purchased this yesterday. After only using it for 30 minutes I have decided to take it back.  1. It will stay attached to my Zune. 2. It has too much static. 3. When there is little static the sound is not clear.  
 On the plus side: It is good to have an advocate for the role of emotions and feelings in rational thought. There can be no doubt that both emotions and feelings have a crucial role to play in learning, discovery, persuasion, belief and insight; the challenge, which Dammassio is not equipped or inclined to meet, is to define the boundaries of the proper role of emotions in rational thought. It is not clear to me how Dammassio would advise members of a jury to weigh the evidence before them 'dispassionately'. Or perhaps he would advise that they shouldn't? Despite the eccentricity of ascribing 'emotions' to single cell organisms, I appreciate Dammassio's distinction between emotions - dispositions organisms adopt, more or less automatically, in response to stimuli which serve to promote restoration of homeostasis, and feelings - dispositions of the mind in which perceptions of emotions expressed in the body, in turn modify those same emotions, and for which mental events can also act as stimuli. This sets up the suggestive and useful idea of the 'brain-body loop', including the 'as-if brain-body loop' where the stimulus is mental. This conception allows Dammassio to explain how the whole body participates in thinking, by mediating processes in the brain. A feeling causes a change in the body (e.g. a tightening of the stomach in response to some cause of anxiety) which in turn produces the sensation of that same emotion (e.g., you feel your stomach tighten, alerting you to your anxiety). This is a very useful idea, and needs in fact the body is able to play this mediating role in brain activity of all kinds, not just feelings and emotions. Dammassio provides a strong argument for understanding the whole person as the appropriate unit for understanding thinking, not just the brain. On the minus side: What is it with this mixture of positivistic, almost Lockean, exposition of human biology, based on 'the latest discoveries of science', in the tradition of Comte, social Darwinism, Ernst Haeckel, Konrad Lorenz, Desmond Morris, Robert Ardrey and company, with, on the other hand, semi-biographical eulogies over the seventeenth century rationalist philosopher Spinoza? It's like the song-and-dance routines put on for pre-match and half-time entertainment at the football. I suspect that Dammassio is relying on a weakness of Spinoza to which he makes a passing reference, namely, that by simply saying that thought and extension are two attributes of the one substance, the difficulty of explaining how thought arises from the activity of material beings is simply by-passed. For this is just what Dammassio does. Like any number of positivists before him, Dammassio finds that 'the latest discoveries of science' have at last given us an understanding of how mental images are formed ... all except for just that last step unfortunately, but that last link in the chain will doubtless be discovered within the next decade or two. Dammassio has the same problem as John Locke: if you see thought as simply the product of one material system interacting with other material systems, then you can push the boundary back further and further (either by speculation or by scientific investigation) but sooner or later you get to that point, and you either insert the homunculus to watch the "movie-in-the-brain" (as Dammassio calls it) or you just hope that that last step will be explained by new discoveries of modern science, just around the corner. Dammassio is sophisticated enough to avoid highlighting the contradiction with any reference to a homunculus, or a yet-to-be-discovered 'control centre' somewhere in the brain, so his ruse seems to be to insert a eulogy to Spinoza in lieu of an explanation. And these 'mirror neurons', introduced to explain empathy, are complete fiction. This is not a claim that needs to be argued, the idea is pure fantasy and the claim to have found the location where they to be found is outrageous. No-one in the field believes it. 'Mirror neurons' are a disturbing step from biological explanation of biological phenomena to biological explanations of social phenomena, and with that, the incipient justification for medical intervention and social engineering as the cure for social problems. All this could be harmless enough. If the object is to improve understanding of the working of the nervous system for the purpose of curing psychiatric illness or brain injury, it is a very worthwhile exercise. But the 'mirror neurons' alert us to the inevitable wider agenda.  For Dammassio, all social institutions  are "mechanisms for exerting homeostasis at the level of the social group", and in fact all social, political and ethical phenomena are "extensions" of these processes within the organism, and have their "forerunners" in the social behaviour of wolves, birds and so on. In other words, puerile social Darwinism of the worst order.  Faced with self-serving naïvité of this breathtaking order, and with obvious fictions like the 'mirror neurons' making their appearance in what is presented as hard neuroscientific fact, one is then somewhat hesitant about accepting as good coin the rather appealing ideas about the role of body maps and emotions in the mediation of thought. Dammassio also cleverly plays with the idea that all the phenomena of culture and human society are somehow less real than the facts of biology, self-aggrandizing illusions of animals who kid themselves that they have become something more. Thus consciousness and mind are "what we call mind and consciousness," (this phrase 'what we call' is used several times). Dammassio is clever enough not, like say Desmond Morris, to be explicit in this ploy, he just suggests to the reader without spelling it out.  
 Adams covers the same info that Conrad and Baker discuss but with a tone of condescension and puritanism that blankets the text like a fine scum of oil over water. Halfway though the book I wanted to curse him; after listening to his boorish and uninspired NPR interview I wanted to punch his lights out. If you like feeling superior, this book is for you. Otherwise stick with Conrad 
 The reader expects to see some useful applications of feminist theory to ancient texts, but the expectation is in vain 
 As an insider for one of the firms highlighted in the book, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the authors spin their stories to  provide the highest possible shock value.  Of course selling more books is  their goal.  Unfortunately, presenting a fair and balanced report often  falls short of that goal...so just leave out the contradictory evidence and  go to press.  In all my years in the industry, I have never seen  consultants independently "destroy" a company.  However, I have  seen many, many poor business decisions that were made by corporate  management and blamed on others 
 I purchased this book while planning a Tea Party.  The statement "15 seasonal Tea Parties" on the front of the book is misrepresentative of the actual contents.  This book is focused more on the art of Tea drinking and Relaxation techniques and suggestions than directions on how to conduct a Tea Party.  The back cover of the book is more properly representative when it states "you'll find the perfect way to enjoy the moment".  It is a Zen Tea focus, not serve 20 people Tea and Crumpets for your mother's birthday focus 
 I found this a difficult book to read.The author uses long meandering sentences frequently enough to distract attention;and her thesis is unclear.The author also tends to make generalising statements,with no evidence to back the statements up.The book does not say anything new;I was disappointed overall 
 Here is another self-help book that didn't need to be written. The useful information could be summerized in a phamplet, if so much - the cover would be sufficient. Why this writing style is so popular is beyond my comprehension (maybe because people like me keep picking them up...AHHH!!!). The use of filler "stories" are quite uneccessary if the author has something unique or interesting to say, but in most of these books it is just a rehash of the same basic information. If this is the first of this type of book you are reading you may find some of it interesting and useful, but that is being generous, but, if you have read any other self-help book remotely similar, don't even waste your time 
 Someone hoping to get a genuine "introduction" to an unfamiliar topic will be either disappointed or greatly misled by this book.   This book puts forth some ideas quite interesting in their own right.  For example, Sanders asserts that Paul has been misunderstood by modern Christians who have read him through the eyes of Luther, and that Paul did not mean the claim "what I want to do, I do not," to apply to his own moral life, nor did he consider himself sinful.    But Sanders holds many views not accepted by the majority of biblical scholars and employs non-standard interpretations of many passages to make his points.  He does not label these views as controversial, or provide any other competing views, but simply lays out his assertions about Paul as incontrovertible facts.    So this book is not really an introduction to Paul, but an introduction to E. P. Sanders.  Someone wanting a truly general introduction to the life and thought of Paul should look elsewhere.  Someone wanting an introduction to the thought of E. P. Sanders should probably look somewhere else too, though, because (I'll presume due to the shortness of the book), his arguments in this book are often quite weak, and the demonstrations given for his more interesting and controversial claims are quite inadequate 
 My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 Once put together, this toy is a great looking pirate ship. Just don't try playing with it. The Lego pieces do not stick firmly together, so even the slightest touch results in the entire ship falling apart. After several frustrating attempts to play with the toy, my five year old gave up on it. We finally used model glue to glue the Legos together so that it wasn't a complete waste of money. If you don't have the time or patience to do the same, this toy isn't for you 
 These were horrible.  I thought I'd try raw foods and I amde a big mistake 
 I sent for 5 cancer books. This is is part mumbo jumbo and part pulling at your heart strings. I didn't find it helpfu 
 I had high hopes for this little gadget, being a fan of grilled sandwiches. Unfortunately, one experience was all it took to convince me that this grill isn't the way to go.  I tried to make two grilled ham and cheese sandwiches. Within about 30 seconds of the grilling, it was pouring cheese out all sides of the grill (and no, before you wonder I didn't use a lot of cheese). I didn't even let it finish the cooking cycle because the cheese was getting underneath the grill and I didn't want it near the cord.   When I opened the unit I got two sandwiches that needed to be separated from one another (and cut into halves) using a steak knife, and even that was a pain. The sandwiches themselves, which started as standard store-bought bread, were now mashed into what looked more like pita bread (hollow, thin, and a little tough). The edges were burned black; just generally not a good sandwich.  As opposed to cleaning the liquid cheese off, this device just went in the trash. I can't recommend this even over just a standard non-stick griddle 
 This book started off good, with the opening of the stadium and the first home run hit by Babe Ruth to christen the stadium. But after the first two chapters the book becomes to involved with the politics and the businessmen behind the stadium and its players. This book did not keep me entertained while I read it, and I found myself many times struggling to turn to the next page 
 The book does not explain enough concepts of winemaking to a beginner and  is not detailed enough for an expert 
 Land of Little Interest would be a better title; it looks like even old Cactus Ed didn't read beyond the first chapter.  All the references he makes in his introduction are from the beginning of the book, and he seems to ignore the rest of the book, as I wish I had.  Boring, unless you want to know about what grows next to irrigating ditches.  And I still don't know what the hell a "campoodie" is (a term used over and over), but, who cares 
 If you are a serious artist or student of art, this book is almost a complete waste of time. Drucker's flowery writing is pretentious and difficult to follow, and in the end she has little to say. She also needs a new editor; There is a typo on the first page! (I believe it's "and and", but I don't have it in front of me) I also find it frustrating that she has no typographic sense. I took an undergraduate class about artists' books which featured her book. Several design students joked in the back of the class that they shouldn't have to read the book on that basis alone. (These are undergraduate students, not people who are writing books about the art and design of BOOKS.) 
 I started out an avid Eco fan. I read Focoult's Pendulum. Twice! Name of the Rose, Island... and Misreadings. Loved the first two, learned a lot from all of Umberto's books. Brilliant man and tireless writer.  But when I read The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, I kept glancing ahead to see if it would get better. Quite a bit went into the pictoral essay of 20th Century book art. I gave Eco the benefit of a doubt; after all, when has he ever let me down before? Though I commend his errudition...isn't it dreadful when the word comes up in a review? It isn't enough to bring a promising premise out of the flatline of death (no pun intended). The final act of the book just plunges into an absurd pagent of kitsch, that must have been a tribute to pop-culture icons, but in the end the payoff was miniscule.   My overwhelming aftertast of The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana was disappointment. It seemed the book had promise to deliver the kind of excitement and intrigue of Focault and Name...but instead, ended up reading like a bibliography catalog of Out-of-Print/Permanently Discontinued books that died on dusty shelves, now long forgotten 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 Someone should actually read this book before reviewing it. Like Bill Gates, Popcorn is as wrong as she is right. Visionary? I'll tell you who the visionary is: Ted Nelson, not Faith. Cocooning? It never actually  happened as Popcorn describes it 
 I must admit I am more than shocked to read some of these reviews. All those that haven't seen the original starring Robert Donat et al simply haven't lived.  Some scenes have been completely desecrated.  The Donat "liar and a thief" questioning scene of the young Winslow, is one of the best in movie making history.  The equivalent in this remake is so weak that even 'Sir Roberts' attending solicitor also lends a hand in the questioning !   However it may have been David Mamets intention not to even to attempt to try and emulate. Likewise 'Sir Roberts' courtroom speech was completely missed.  Beg, steel or borrow the origianl VHS copy, and if need be go out and buy a VCR just to watch and enjoy this gem.  If there is a movie studio lobby somewhere to get 'essentials' like this released on DVD I'll join it  ! ! ! !  
 I'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about Christianity.  By now, thanks to this film and the book of the same title, most individuals interested in Christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus.  That being said, I will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film, and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses.  As a movie the Code leaves much to be desired.  There are gaps in the story line and overlooked pieces of evidence in The Louvre museum by the police that no respectable law enforcement agency would fail to detect.  For example, Langdon and detective Neveu, after successfully evading Captain Feche in the museum, strike a series of clues (writings, bloodstains, keys) that the entire investigatory team analyzing the crime scene failed to uncover. Langdon and Detective Neveu fail to ask each other seemingly obvious questions that- if answered- might end the movie immediately or take it in a whole new direction.  Ian McKellen, a fabulous actor of extraordinary talent, lacks complete credibility in this film.   So what went catastrophically wrong?  Well, it wasn't the book or its author Dan Brown, who has been selling copies of the Code faster then they can count them.  And although the performances were at best questionable, by themselves these are not enough to sink the movie.  The most obvious answer as to why the Code is so deficient is Ron Howard, the director.  Mr. Howard simply lacked the vision and forethought to successfully and credibly present The Da Vinci Code in a manner believable (as a film, not history) to the audience. I think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings were captured by the mystery and romantic luster most conspiracies are imbued with, and had a pre-formulated supposition of Jesus and his relationship to Mary Magdalene 
 i was disapoint with this cd-it's style of kate bus 
 Some reviewer here said that the astros didn't score any runs. That is inaccurate. They did score many runs, but didn't win any games. I was at game 4 in Houston where backe was awesome but we couldn't score. Our offense just didn't do the job. But I'm still proud of the stros for the amazing run down 15-30 and left for dead all the way to the series. GO ASTROS. There are die hard astro fans out there like me 
 The book may be easy to read and a good overview of the ZONE diet plan, but...  the first recipe I've tried, vegetarian lasagna, turned out to be a disaster.  To begin with, the ingredient list is faulty.  It calls for 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning, but in the procedure, you only use 3  teaspoons.  It then tells you to blend the cottage cheese until smooth -  what cottage cheese - it was never on the ingredient list?   Finally,  right when you now know something is definetly off with the recipe and your  assembling the noodles, etc. - IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE PAN.  So much for  40/30/30 for tonight's dinner and the two hours in the kitchen.  The recipe  was a good idea and I'm interested in a solution if you ever read this Ms.  Gittleman 
 As many books the beginning of this one is excellent. But as you go over and over it gets boring and boring. The book has four stories that at the end will meet and all of them are stark boring. And at the end... just skip it. Better'd be if you skip this book 
 This is a picture book biography of Dizzy Gillespie. We learn that he is beaten by his father while growing up.  At school he takes an interest in music and let's his anger flow through the trumpet he is learning to play.  He goes on to make a name for him self.  He makes his own style of music  and the people love it!    At one point in the text a bunch of symbols were written and it looked like the author was wanting to write a curse word in the book but used the symbols as well.  I really didn't like that at all in a picture book for young readers.  I really would look else where for a good bio on Dizzy. 
 If this is supposed to be a satire, then the author forgot the key element...wit. This waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor, and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through. Here's a little advice for the author; take thirty-five cents out of your coin purse, drop it into the nearest pay phone, dial the number of whoever told you that you'd make a decent author, and inform them that they have made baby Jesus weep 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 I already knew that Michael Savage was a draft dodger since I always check the New Hampshire Chickenhawk Database. From some reason they do not have his birthday. According to the official "Name Authority" from the Library of Congress database, his real name is Michael A. Weiner and he was born March 31, 1942. But why is he a hypocrit regarding American soldiers like me?  Dr. Weiner/Savage does the usual butter-me-up, like on page 104. He talks about former Hollywood actors who served in WWII, "True American heroes yes...They, unlike the empty suits of today, fought shoulder-to-shoulder alongside America's finest young boys. The farmers, the steelworkers, the taxi drivers. The people who made this country great." The only problem here is that he is describing MY family and not his.  His image of former soldiers is extremely negative and very offensive to me. In describing a veteran expressing his true feelings about war "war is awful..he never wanted to fight, he didn't believe in fighting although he wore the uniform [what do you mean Weiner?] and yes he was a hero and has many medals even though he naver actually fought." This isn't even the pot calling the kettle black. "Their anti-war comments both undermine our troops' morale and encourage our enemies by creating a picture of a divided front." Weiner also states, "[t]he ill-informed comments of these camera-craving, ex-military types in the attempt to prop-up a sagging self-esteem, do extensive damage to the war on terror and our military." Keep that second comment in mind, but who is the guy with the self-esteem problem? He doesn't have any "fake" medals so who is he to criticize a person who actually served?  If anybody is harming our troops it is Weiner/Savage. On page 88 he actually tells us it is okay for al-Qaida to kill our soldiers. Really. "If you were a leader or an intellectual in the Muslim world and you saw the debauchery promulgated by the West...and saw your young people gravitating toward the filth pumped over your airwaves, what would you do? Frankly you would support al-Qaida or any organization [like al-Qaida in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan?] that would want to stop that flood of pollution from entering your country." Thanks for clearing up why it is okay for these guys to kill our soldiers. And here I thought they just hated our freedoms.   There are other problems with this book. On page 108 he decries the "intense use of drugs." Yeah, like Limbaugh's abuse of Oxycontin that he forgot to mention. Most diturbing to me is his use of words such as "sheeple," which is word coined by racist Aryan Nations members. Why he would use a favorite word of anti-Semites, seeing as how Weiner/Savage is a Jew, as well as a word used extensively by Timothy McVey is quite strange. He also uses dismissive language like "leg-crossers," (page 85)which I assume is a substitute for "bitch." And, finally, for all of you steelworkers, taxi drivers, etc., who are his fans: this guy thinks you're dumb. All you need to do is read page 106 to see what he thinks about opinions of non-college graduates.  As one last snipe on this guy, I just love that photo of him (all photos are of him) in the book, under the line "my ship has come in." That is one big yacht he is at the helm of. To his question of where to steer his yacht, how about towards the Gulf and to join the fight? I did ny combat, now you do yours. 
 Love Leonard Cohen, but this particular item disappointed us immensely 
 This would have to be the worst book I have ever read.Wow Will is running from dead people. Some one is trying to kill him so cool.How much more boring can you get.I would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater. So what I'm saying is it stinks 
 If you're into very traditional, formal poetry, than this is the volume for you.  However, if you're looking for something more original and inspired, you may be disappointed.  I was looking for fodder for my wedding ceremony and found scant evidence of any deeply evocative poetry in this volume 
 This movie has nothing to do with a house. Its really just a low budget rape porn. I tossed it in the trash about 20 minutes into it. 
 I'll be sincere.I didn't read all this trash-book.Someone lent this trash-book to me, some years ago, here in Brazil.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it.In fact, I read less than 10% of this biblical-garbage. This was a best-seller some years ago, in many parts of the world, including Brazil and USA. Today the best seller is Da Vinci Code.A trash-book so absurd, as this trash-book. Every time has its own trash-best-seller. About a century ago eugenics was fashion.Later came communism, fascism, nazism, ufologism, etc. This bibliolatry is a good book only for morons or atheists.If you are an atheist, this trash-book is a good way to debunk the bible. 
 not a good script kind of slow, a regular movie if You are into history In America, but If You dont live there, or got any interest in this particular plot, I wont recomended, is borin 
 I expected this book was part of the popular Kid Concoctions book series and quickly found out is was not. My children were bored with the outdated projects that seemed to have been put together with little creative effort 
 This was a wedding gift a little over a year ago.  With one time daily use the basket is broken (It had been limping along for 6 months) and has always filled the water meter with bubbles so I had to get used to knowing how much water I was putting in by estimation.  This is cheap, I am so sorry my grandma paid so much for this unit.  She was trilled with it because she thought she was buying me a coffee maker I could have for a long time.  I will be buying a bunn. 
 Collector Books did not live up to its generally fine quality of productions in this guide to English ceramics.  The text is awkwardly written, confusing or contradictory in places, and colorless, lacking enthusiasm.  Worse, a very large number of the illustrations are seriously shadowed, a most annoying flaw in an identification guide.  On the plus side, the range and selection of objects discussed is ample, and the illustrations of marks are helpful 
 This book is one of the worst books I have ever read, the author has no idea what's going on in LOST the portrayal of the characters is so off the mark that's it laughable I was so disappointed in this book that I actually threw it out in the rubbish bin. If you like LOST and need something to do in-between seasons or episodes bang you head against the wall it would be a far better use of your tim 
 4 year, 1 year, and 4 day cycles are used.  Works great except when there is a missed point, or an inversion.  Author recommends his Adam Theory Book.  If Delta Phenonema "pinpoints exact turning points", why would the author advertise the Adam Theory Book?? 
 I have read many of Koontz's books and I have got to say that this is the worst one that I've read to date.  For those that have yet to sink their teeth into some of Koontz's better work, I would suggest Mr. Murder or Intensity.  Leave this one on the shelf to collect dust.  Or better yet, throw it in the trash with the rest of the garbage.  
 Nothing in Nazneen's life has ever been under her control.  Even her birth itself was left to fate: she seemed to be stillborn but then she finally took her first breath and fate allowed her to live.  This story was told to her throughout her childhood in Bangladesh, and she learned that it was futile to fight against fate.  When her father announces that she, at eighteen, is to go to London to marry a forty-year-old man named Chanu, Nazneen doesn't argue.  London is lonely.  Nazneen doesn't speak English, is discouraged from making many friends and can't really relate to her husband, a selfish and pompous man who seems to think himself overly kind because he doesn't beat his wife.  She tries being passive and going along with her life.  Then she tries rebelling in small ways but is frustrated when Chanu doesn't seem to notice she's neglected her housekeeping duties.  It is only when Nazneen and Chanu's baby boy is in the hospital that Nazneen begins to appreciate her husband's good qualities and she also experiences some moments of pure happiness.  Throughout the next twenty years or so, though, Nazneen is unable to hold onto that happiness.  It is only when she finds out that her husband finally has taken steps to put into action one of his long-discussed plans that she is spurred to action.  This book, for me, was one long and depressing chore to read.  Nazneen allowed herself to be a slave to her fate, but the entire book was a detailed list of all of the ways in which her life was completely unbearable.  I found it agonizing to read about someone who was so thoroughly unhappy all of the time, and it made me anxious to read about the ways in which Chanu continued to mess up the lives of Nazneen and their children.  The book had an uplifting ending, but it was so abrupt that it seemed unrealistic and jarring, instead of the relief it should have been. 
 I read Maier's first book A Skeleton In God's Closet at least 5 times and will read it again. It's excellent. I was very excited to see a sequel, but was sadly let down.  1. Even tho I completely agree with his amillenium end-times view and worry that the hyper-new-prophecy-a-minute crowd IS damaging the cause of Christ, I was uncomfortable with how the author, thru his character Jon, TRASHED real people and authors. This put a sour taste in my mouth from the get-go.  2. Something I could never figure out was why Jon never went to the end times scriptures to discredit the obviously silly notion of Jesus returning for a quickie 'second chance' scenario.   3. The plot by the Jesus/Joshua figure and his brain being affected by chemical compunds that made him brilliant (as well as revealing the whole plot to his victim) is reminiscent of a comic book scenario and not worthy here (in fact it had an 'Austin Powers' flair of not personally witnessing an unnecessarily complicated death). It came off as pure cheese.  4. The Scriptures are pretty darn clear. It doesn't take much study to know that the whole stinkin' planet wouldn't just swallow this scenario hook, line, and sinker--besides Jesus eschewed so much of the pomp and circumstance Joshua apparently expects in this story.   5. The book was uneven and felt like it had a point to prove instead of a story to tell. But I'll give Maier another chance if he write's something new 
 This book claims to provide important keys to office communication, but there is nothing ground-breaking here. In fact, it's a disappointing waste of time of the first order, as most of the items covered are mere common sense.  If you need help remembering not to refuse a request by your boss by telling him that "that's not my job" then, by all means, purchase this book.  Otherwise, try one of the 1000s of books out there that can really help you achieve this goal, such as Stephen Covey's "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" or Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" 
 I guess it is a good market now for anything about Islam. This is all old news, looks like reworked columns. Not insightful, not fresh, just tired old stuff mainly about middle to upper class women. Save your money.   
 A KILLER WITHIN is an obviously low budget Indie film by director Brad Keller and new writers Chris and William Peirson.  The primary problem with this murder 'mystery/thriller/crime' film is that the writing and acting and directing is such that within the first few minutes of this movie you can figure out not only what is going to happen but who is the perpetrator!  Terrill Addison (C. Thomas Howell) is a wealthy lawyer, Harvard graduate first in his class, ex-District Attorney with fancy wife, house, income, child, and a weird fantasy life with his alcoholic, tramp-like blowsy wife Becky (Sean Young).  His partner Sam (Ben Browder) has always been Terrill's second: second best at Harvard, lesser member of the firm, unable to father children, etc.  Sam's wife Sarah (Dedee Pfeiffer, unable to have children, devotes her life to taking care of Terrill and Becky's 4-year-old son....  One night Becky is found murdered and her son in a coma.  Coincidentally with this is the information that one Sonny Bruton (Mark Hanson) has been released from a life sentence for murders, a sentence tried by Terrill.  AND the only person who knows the whereabouts of Sonny is another enemy of Terrill's, one Vargas (Giancarlo Esposito) whose job as a cop was destroyed by Terrill some years back.  Well, after some fancy footwork, Terrill re-bonds with Vargas and they explore the murder that the local police have suggested was perpetrated by Terrill himself.  After a spree of exploring the Barrio, confronting all manner of odd people and circumstances, the primary suspect Sonny is electrocuted in a swimming pool absenting him as the possible murderer, Terrill learns new facts about his partner, etc.  Just when the crime is finally 'solved' the writers insert a spoiler that ends the movie with doubt as to the true murderer and opens the gate for the dreaded possibility of a sequel.  The acting is acceptable (and in some cases very fine) and the locations are well captured.  One unnecessary intrusion in this film is the musical score, so obviously created on synthesizer keyboards trying to mimic an full orchestra, a sound that stops only long enough for intervention of Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' that makes no sense, but continues to cover the dialogue to the same degree as the keyboards stuff.  This is a rainy night popcorn movie to have on while you relax to forget the realities of the day.  There are some touches of good film making buried here: finding them is a better detective game than the script provides.  Grady Harp, March 0 
 I have read 3 other Sue Margolis boks and enjoied them all. This book was really really BAD 
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 You would think that with this band, this would be a great disc, right? Sadly, it's not all that great. Lou and Quine were at loggerheads at the time. As a result, Quine's guitar is oddly muted and minimized on much of this. As much as I love Lou Reed, and I do, he will never be the guitar player that Robert Quine was. This CD suffers, as a result, from Lou's lack of guitar skills - even on his own music, by his own standards. The second thing that makes it a not-buy is Lou's refusal or inability to sing. He simply shouts his way through all the songs. The third reason to give this a pass is that there are no dynamics. All the songs are played as loud as possible, meaning that ear fatigue sets in a little over halfway through. It begins to sound very samey after a while. Lou's best live set remains the semi-bootleg "American Poet" album. Even for a Lou Reed fan, this is not a must, I'm sorry to say. 
 I thought the movie was disjointed, it lacked subject matter.  Very odd 
 A friend loaned me this book in an attempt to get me interested in the x-files. This book is pure junk, as is the show that it is about. I'm just tried of the lame shows of chris carter and I wish people would wise up.  This stuff is sheer garbage!! 
 This DVD is terrible!  All the songs are from the Buena Vista Social Club but are butchered.  The musicians are constantly missing notes, they bring on "special" guests who can barely play their instruments.  Save yourself the expense or at least rent this botched effort before you buy it.  
 I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon.  What a major disappointment this disk is.  Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well.  Another case of "dumbing-down" music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down).  Good "children's music" inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk 
 Stephen Brookfield writes 254 pages on one of the most important topic in our world and basically says nothing useful. His style is very "touchy / feely, and he writes very superfluous statements that provide little, if any enlightenment to the reader. On his primary topic on how to teach critical thinking I found no practical application. This book reminds me of a college student's attempt to write intelligently on an important topic, but it was way over his head 
 I read a lot of books both for knowledge and entertainment.  This book brought me neither of the two.  The author invites the readers into the depth of what is clearly her battle to come to grips with her near-white skin.  We were also way-to-close to her mental turmoil.  Actually, I would have liked for her journal to have at least been edited before being published. The book seemed to be simply a loose collection of ramblings about a woman being black in America.  Not very well written.  I did not feel as though I got my money's worth 
 i dont have this ramp but my neighbor does. i have a homemade quaterpipe that is 4 feet in height and is about the same price in materials. the lauch ramp is really small and after awhile it gets pretty boring. im a skateboarder and usually go 2 da sk8prk which i find more fun then playing on a small lauch ramp. i dont think this ramp is worth the price at all. u can get ramp plans on websites for free and u can build a much better ramp for a cheeper price 
 This book was very disappointing, and quite frankly depressing for a new mother. My least favorite part was when the mother told the son you had better get here quick, and the image of him rocking what may be a dying mother was a little too much. There are sentimental stories, but this is just plain maudlin. 
 I bought this item a few years ago and then it just stopped working.  First it wouldn't shut off, then it stopped all together.  I would not recommend this item 
 This album is incredibly ambient with lots of electronic sounds floating, and breathy voices echoing in and out of the stratosphere. Pacific is simple in its structure; and for the most part is listenable. At timed it tries to do way too much of the underwater country and emo blend for the eardrums, but their down-tempo jinglebell opiate trip is a recommendation if you like slower music that's stuck between trying to impress the scenesters and rehashing acoustic grunge. Overall I'd say this album would be perfect for a midnight mescaline trip on a west-coast beach, or some other equally applicable deviation. The group includes Lucas Jensen, clay, and Howard Hudson, and is currently playing shows to support the release.

 Let's start with P52, that credit card sized piece of papyrus, thought to be the oldest surviving scrap of scripture of the Gospel of John.  Mr. Ehrman repeatedly mentions that it was found in a "trash heap in Upper Egypt."  In fact, Mr. Ehrman does this every single time P52 is mentioned.   To paraphrase Ralph Manheim, "It is the half educated writer, without clear ideas, who generally feels that to say a thing only once is rather slight."  Mr. Ehrman is much too intelligent to be doing this by accident.  Therefore I believe it is done with purpose, and done oddly enough, without seeming too concerned about in which city it was discovered.  According to Dr. Bruce Metzger, to whom Mr. Ehrman dedicates his new book,  Misquoting Jesus, that fragment "was purchased in Egypt as early as 1920, but it sat unnoticed for years among similar fragments of papyri."  Hey, I thought a trash heap was a mountain of garbage one finds in a landfill with vermin crawling about and seagulls flying overhead.  Now it seems to include any stack of papyri that may contain holy scripture.  If that isn't a giveaway, I don't know what is.  While Mr. Ehrman gleefully tears apart any possibilities that most of the apocrypha could have any credibility (he claims nearly all of them are fakes or forgeries, and probably correctly), he nonchalantly mentions off the cuff that all but seven of the New Testament books are forged as well (those seven themselves also being tampered with)  The latter is, I believe, the real purpose for writing this book.  Lacking the courage to make this the focused topic, he covertly "slipped it in."  Since then he has made it the focus of a book called Misquoting Jesus.   The tendency for conspiracy theory to emanate from Mr. Ehrman is common.  There can be many reasons why so many more recently hand copied manuscripts of the New Testament differ from the oldest ones.  Mr. Ehrman points to large political movements most often while ignoring some more obvious reasons.  Case in point:  the Gospel of Mark.  He says the earliest copies show Jesus reacting angrily to just about everything.  Reasoning that the older versions must be the correct ones, Mr. Ehrman assumes the newer copies were purposely changed in order to sound more like Matthew, Luke, and John.  Could it actually be possible that these oldest copies have survived through the ages because it was known back then that they were wrong?  Consider that a scribe or two might've thought that a "compassionate" Jesus was rather wimpy and so rewrote Him to be angry all the time to show a more powerful God.  These "angry" copies were then set aside by church elders from the other often read "compassionate" copies and preserved for any number of reasons, perhaps as examples of bad behavior by "foolish knaves."  While the correct copies were handled so much that they fell apart and were discarded.  Just look at your own bookshelf.  The books that last the longest are the ones read the least.  It is an incorrect assumption on Ehrman's part that the oldest known copies were the only copies written at that time.    Regarding the differences among the four Gospel accounts:  If scribes were so prone to make the Gospels sound alike by changing them, why after 2,000 years and countless hand copied manuscripts are there still differences in accounts of events, such as when Jesus died in relation to the timing of the Passover meal or what garments were found in the tomb after the resurrection?   Also, could some of those "lost Christianities" which competed with what Mr. Ehrman refers to as the prevailing "proto-orthox" views have failed the test of time simply because they were wrong?  And if history is suspect anytime it is "written by the winners," schould we also be inclined to doubt the holocaust or the failure of Soviet Communism?  Perhaps Mr. Ehrman thinks that slavery got a "bad rap" from an historical perspective.  Maybe he will start rooting for the Chicago Cubs.  One can only wonder.  In defense of Mr. Ehrman, I will say that his writing style is engaging and lively, and not totally without fact.  But he does give away his agenda at times, which makes me question his credibility. While he is no Dan Brown, who still stands behind falsehoods to bring Jesus "down to our level," Mr. Ehrman seems to have an agenda he doesn't wish to share with us in his book.  It is not uncommon for secular Bible scholars to attack the KJV simply to shake the foundation of the "religious right."  After hearing Mr. Ehrman interviewed on NPR, that is exactly what I think he's doing.  It is expected that a growning number of "secular fundamentalists" will applaud anything that contradicts the New Testament, rejoicing in not having a God looking over their shoulders and telling them who they can and can't sleep with 
 I think theres pretty much two themes in this book:  "Hey guys, we are just like you!!  Please be our friends!"  Look, I was born and raised in America, and one thing these people (for the most part immigrants) fail to understand is that people here respect a person for being true to themselves.  Its called being a man's man.  Why do people insist on lying to the American public just out of fear that they won't be accepted?  Hey there are things I beleive in that a lot Americans probably won't but it would be spineless of me to drop those beliefs just to impress other people. Come on....this isn't high school.  There's a million different viewpoints in this country and thats part of what makes the American experience so great.    Hey, to each his own right?  I can respect it if it were a book about personal convictions, but it is trying to pass as a book related to broad Islamic acceptance of all these various viewpoints. Islam, though flexible in some respects, is very rigid in other respects (i.e. - killing civilians, homosexuality, alchahol, fornication, etc.)  So what do these losers do?  They attempt to change the religion (just like Osama tried) just to suit their own agenda.   Islam is about GOD'S agenda and how a person who beleives should submit unconditionally to it.   Don't expect this to be a representation of the muslim community in America in general.  This is just a small group of pathetic spineless, gutless, friendless people dying for acceptance.   I impore the readers here to google an image of the author of this book and see for yourself.     2. "Hey, maybe we can convince people that homosexuality is permissable in Islam"  Get real.   It seems that ever since September 11, Islam has been viciously attacked from all angles.   Either its homosexual people trying to "reform" the religion so that it accepts homosexuality, or its terrorists finding loopholes to justify terrorism,  or its the media making a quick buck off of the public paranoia over Islam.  It just never ever ends with these people.       Save your hard-earned money, folks.   Gas prices are going up everyday and its quite foolish to spend your money on a book that represents the thoughts of a few hundred muslims (out of the several million in America.     I would think that what the readers here really want to know is accurate, unbiased, unapolagetic information related to Islam and Terrorism.  My recommendation:  "Unholy War:  Terror in the name of Islam"   (John Esposito)   In a nutshell, "I pity da fool" who buys this book.  Adios.  
 This author was so full of himself that he had to write a book about it. Here it is.  "Nobel Prize Nominee" alone, is a real good look into the mind of this author. It's nothing more than words. Anyone can be nominated for anything with the Nobel recognitions. Looks good. Sounds Good. But does not require merit or depth to be nominated.  Just like the author. 
 The approach towards multi-orgasms is similar to the one of Barbara Keesling. You have to come very close to the end and contract your PC muscle to stop yourself from crossing the point of no return. Hopefully, at that time your prostate will contract and you have got an orgasm. Next, you have to calm down and gradually come back again very close to the edge for a second orgasm. This is in theory but the problem is that most of the time I ended up with unpleasant semi-ejacul. or very stiff and painful PC muscle without reaching even one orgasm. I practiced this method for 3 weeks and was unpleasantly surprised because of sharp decrease in my ability to last long.  I searched for an explanation and found it in "scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex". According to its author scientist Ritz regular and strong contractions of the PC muscle cause hyper activation of the "sympathetic nerves" in the genitals. They execute each ejaculat. That's why he recommends avoiding using the PC muscle. Instead you should use the "VIP Muscle", which is completely different, yet a nearby muscle. It is connected with the "parasympathetic nerves" and cannot influence the ejaculat. control. I easily achieved multi-orgasms with it and after several days my PE (prem. ejacul.) was gone. (update: it was not only gone but my endurance now is the record 40+ minutes)   You may find the taoistic information in "The Multi-Orgasmic Man" refreshing but if you want results (multi-orgasms or greater endurance) then the result could be the opposite namely PE as happened with me. I would suggest reading this book only for its exotic side but if you regularly and strenuously use your PC muscle, it will most probably turn counter productive 
 This book is incredibly difficult to review, simply because it is both the best and worst piece of writing you are likely to read this year.  You desperately want to like this book because of it's innovatively and beautifully written prose and its blindingly obvious potential. However, in the end, the bad repetitive and completely dull elements of this story win out above the interesting writing and all else that this book may offer.  Like a dykey 'Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas', Tea's stream of consciousness narrative examines the underbelly of 20th century Lesbianism in San Fransisco. While this is a fascinating subject, Tea manages to inject the work with such unbearable repetition ('We were all on drugs', 'I was avoiding this girl', 'My green hair', 'This girl kissed me in the bathroom' etc etc) and works so hard to push this book to the very edge of the lesbian counterculture.   Was I meant to sympathise? Was I meant to care about this woman and her relationship/alcohol/drug issues? Probably not, but if I don't care about the subject of a book, I am unlikely to see it through to its conclusion to find out what happens. As many other reviewers have suggested, I couldn't help but wonder why this repetitive tale necessiated an entire book.  Nevertheless, I did stick with the mindless drug-hazed oblivion that was the conclusion, and came out none the wiser, but merely feeling as if Tea had played to a number of lesbian tropes and wasted my time on her drugs, mindless sex and green hair and latex gloves.  But nevertheless, beautiful prose never realised 
 This book will be a great disappointment to many stroke survivors and their relatives, as it was to me, a survivor. It tells the story of one man in England, with moments that make you think there is a similarity, only to be disappointed.  The only hope for the book is the wife's diary, and her  feelings from the event through the treatment. But even then there is the  feeling that her diary in censored, knowing that it would be published. The  author does direct the reader to some other good books, and gives us a  happy ending. The book does teach us that life goes on, even if you have a  stroke, but stroke suvivors already know that fact 
 I am new to the worlds of Bertice Small.  This is the first book of hers that I have read. And I have to admit to being very disappointed.  She's written a huge collection of books, so she is obviously an experienced author, however I found her dialog to be stilted and the characters to be somewhat unsympathetic.  Starting with the fact that Adair name drops at every opportunity that she is the bastard daughter of King Edward.  I loved it when she finally met Conal, and tried that line out on him, and he said (paraphrasing) - well, you weren't born of King Edward's Queen, so get over yourself.  My feeling is that either this is an old fashioned sort of romance novel, or that Ms. Small is writing more of an historical angle to the story than a romance angle.  There is a lot about characters from the War of the Roses, but you'd sort of have to have a history book beside you, or go to Wikipedia, to follow along with where Adair fits into the catalog of characters and events.  Elizabeth of York, for example, I needed to go look her up.  Then I had one of those moments as a reader, where you're hitting the palm of your hand with your forehead.  She's pregnant, but gets on the same horse with her husband - so you can imagine there is not a lot of room in the saddle - to ride to her wedding day.    anyway - Ms. Small has a reputation, so I'll try one or two more of her books before I give up 
 Rarely does one find a book concerning the Cuban Revolution in which the author at least makes an effort to keep there political views out of the analysis.  Marifeli Perez-Stable is no exception, as her book will either be praised by the left, or critizied by the right.  In writing such a biased account her credibility is jepordized; not only because anyone with half a brain will realize this, but anyone with limited study in regards to the revolution see's many flaws.  Amongst the most prevelant is the complete neglect of Cuba's "Counterculture" and the booming tobacco industry in Cuba throughout the 50's (she harbors on sugar as if every Cuban was either a plantation owner or slave).  Hopefully Cuban books in the future will steer clear of political biases and present the facts, and only the facts 
 I'm not a big Apple Computer fan, but I was very disappointed by this book. Covering the tumultuous period just before Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the book attempts to provide all the 20/20 insight necessary to explain the company's short-comings. Unfortunately, though, the book is so poorly written -- and doesn't at all hide the disdain the author feels for Jobs -- that it's nearly unreadable. Rather than tell the story in a linear timeline, the book jumps back and forth in a very confusing way. If you didn't already know the Apple story, you wouldn't know what was going on.   Also, considering all the success Apple has had since then (with the iMac and Titanium PowerBook), this topic is moot now anyway 
 I liked the pants, however, I needed another size and it took WEEKS for them to get back to me.  When I sent them back, I requested another size but they never sent them.  So I just got a refund, which I had to call several times to get 
 NO KANYE, NO CODY CHESSNUT, NO FUGEES, NO C.S.U. MARCHING BAND...these were the highlights of the film!  Don't get me wrong--they put some good performances on this CD, but come on...would you buy PE's "It Takes a Nation of Millions" if it had no "Bring the Noise," "Prophets of Rage" or "Rebel Without a Pause?"  Just put the movie on in another room and listen to it...it's better than this chopped-up soundtrack.  It doesn't capture ANY of the raw energy, The power or the impromptu jamming (except for "You Got me"). The sound quality is better on the movie, too.  Great film, bad soundtrack 
 For some great advice email me at humorgirl86@hotmail.com. I have owned a cockatiel for 8 years and have alot of expierience. This book is informative on housing, feeding, breeding and healing. It has great  pictures but, it's not the pictures that make the book it's the words! It  doesn't go into great detail about everything. It hardly has a page on  training and that doesn't even help if at all. Sure it may seem good but  once you read it, it really isn't that good at all. I say that you should  go to the pet store or book store and actually read the book or scan it to  make sure that it has what you want. Petsmart and Petco are great pet  stores that have plenty of books and all the needs for a cockatiel 
 Five stars awarded for sincere effort at persuading evolutionary atheists to consider the claims of Genesis, since the author claims to be a Genesis-Christian (can't be Christian without Genesis). Three stars deducted for challenging the very Genesis that makes this Christian-scientist able to believe a cogent alternative to atheistic evolution. Genesis unrevised in its plaintext vocabulary needs no interpretation or reworking. God did just fine in telling us what He did and how/when. As the Ultimate Communicator as well as Creator, He left us with an unambiguous record of real history as it happened. No scientific revisionism, even by well-intentioned-but-mistaken astronomers, is required. The Lord is forcing the world to a faith-decision, Genesis vs. Evolution: Did God REALLY say...? The WORD said in the Beginning, 'Let it be'. And it was so. The world asks, 'Was it really so?' The WORD answers, 'It is written. So it was.' Any questions? Can people handle God's own truth? 
 This book wants to make you a Christian, it tells you that Mo is bad and Jesus is good. It's very unfair as it trumpets the merits of Jesus while saying Mo was cruel and self-indulgent.  ..but it makes no mention of Jesus's bad points and the nasty bits in the New testament where for instance Jesus encourages the beating of slaves (Luke 12:47) and the bit where Jesus tells you to burn unbelievers (John 15:6, Matthew 13:41-42).  Dr Gabriel obviously loves Jesus and hates Muhammad but for all Muhammad's faults he wasn't dumb enough to curse a fig-tree for not bearing fruit while it was out of season (Matthew 21:18-19, Mark 11:13-14).  Dr Gabriel also tells you with relish that Muhammad stole from trade caravans by going on ghazi raids on enemy merchants but he fails to point out that Jesus broke the law by stealing corn on the Sabbath (Mark 2:23), and he encouraged his disciples to take a horse without asking permission (Matthew 21).  The point i'm trying to make (rather laboriously) is that neither Jesus or Mo were perfect and that both men did some awful things in their times and great suffering has often resulted from their respective legacies and folks like Dr Gabriel don't help us understand things by selectively reading the bible and quran and dissing one guy while extolling the merits of the other.   this really is a stupid and infantile book ...does this guy really have a PhD? 
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
 To me a "basic wool flannel trouser" would be a more classic fit. The very low waist (NOT waist), 4" zipper, too-long, and very wide cuff was an awful disappointment. I own 3 pr. Harve Benard from 4-5 years ago which fit me beautifully - same good tailoring, lined wool - so that's what I expected. I am 5'7" and this year's design drags on the floor and sits down on my hips. The pant legs are 4" wider than my old ones. Also missing here are the side elastic options 
 What a disappointment.  There were no reviews to help me out when I bought this item.  I discovered upon receiving it that I'd spent $25 on an instruction book for the very expensive piece of exercise equiptment.  It's of no use to me.  
 I was anxious to read the books written by this author since they take place near Charleston, a place we visit often.  I was very disappointed!  This book should have ended about 3 chapters earlier.  The book lacked depth and character development.  The dialogue was contrite and superficial.  I will definitely NOT be reading anymore books from this author 
 A carjacking case and a missing 4-year-old boy trigger tension in a fictional town of New Jersey. "Freedomland" which is based on Richard Price's book and stars Samuel L. Jackson and Julianne Moore, could have been a gritty thriller with a better hand like Spike Lee (who did "Clockers" based on Price's book). Unfortunately, in spite of its occasionally interesting moments, "Freedomland" falls flat with lack of sure-handed direction.  Julianne Moore plays Brenda whose four-year-old son is missing. Police detective Lorenzo played by Samuel L. Jackson thinks something is wrong with her testimony as to how her boy was kidnapped, but finding the missing child is not easy as the injured mother suffers severely from the shock and her traumatic past. The film also involves several scenes of racially-triggered violence.  Every part of the film is decently made. They are shot with authentic locations, good supports (from Edie Falco, Ron Eldard and William Forsyth) and intense acting from Moore. She is so intense at times that some may think she is overdoing it, but anyway she is credible as tormented mother. Still something is not just right like Brenda's testimony.  [CLUMSY STORYTELLING] So many things are going on at one time. The film at first centers around the mystery of a missing boy, and then it raises a question about the conflict among the Afro-Americans. Instead of developing these ideas, director Joe Roth introduces new topics one after another into the story. As a result the mystery of the kidnapped boy never becomes intriguing. Lorenzo's inner struggle as black detective is not explored enough. You expect surprises from the solutions of the mystery, or cathartic effect after seeing tense acting from the leads. Sorry but you cannot have either of them.  "Freedomland" includes more than one socially relevant issue. Film's "Friends of Kent" is based on the real group "Friends of Jennifer for Missing Children," volunteer group that searches missing persons. Edie Falco's character is based on Donna Cutugno, leader of the group "Friends of Jennifer for Missing Children," who also appears as Elaine in the film. Here "Freedomland" is given a chance to be original, but Joe Roth somehow wastes it with among the jumbled storytelling. The film has excellent ingredients to make a superb thriller, which you don't see in "Freedomland. 
 Usually I am a "Happy Consumer"... NOT THIS TIME. My 13 month daughter loves flap books and loves to sit quietly and flip through books. This book left a DEEP paper cut on my child's thumb and blood all over book!!!!!!! Although she did not cry, I was horrified!!!!! Parents beware! Do yourself a favor and buy books that have the thicker pages/ flaps for this age group. Be sure to inspect books like this for sharp edges 
 I think people who know nothing about love should avoid writing books about it. Hooks knows a bit more about hate. This is obvious from her own words.  Quote: Bell Hooks (black professor of English at City College of New York)  "I am writing this essay sitting beside an anonymous white male that I long to murder." [From her book A Killing Rage, quoted by David Horowitz in Hating Whitey, Spence Publishing, 1999, p. 31.] Hooks needs to understand that hate is wrong no matter where or who it issues forth from...black or white or anyone. Hate isn't right. I think anyone who hates someone, especially an anonymous, innocent person, should seriously consider adequate professional counseling for an extended period of time.  I think there are disorders which include the definition of hating strangers as one of their markers. We should never encourage or condone this kind of sick behavior. Thank you for your time. 
 I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement, however I was disappointed.  While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment, after the first day it looks like it's two years old.  If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily.  And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt.  Don't even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket.  Finally, the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover.  If you're in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover, but for the rest of us...keep shopping or buy insurance 
 Lisa Endlich, formerly a trader with Goldman Sachs, has written a book on Goldman Sachs' history and corporate culture.  As a former employee, she, like every other former employee writing about her employer, must have been torn between loyalty to her old employee, and wanting to write a truly dispassionate history.  One or the other must give.  The one truly interesting tidbit in this book was that Goldman, the founder, refused to support the British during World War One, as did John Pierpont Morgan and almost all others, out of loyalty to his German roots.  Goldman Sachs was and is undoubtedly an extremely interesting and extremely accomplished partnership and now company; this book however, is little more than a summary of discussions held around water coolers.  If you're interviewing for a job with GS, already have a job with GS, or merely looking for a good bibliography of this history of various Wall Street firms, this book is definitely worth reading, otherwise I do not know what purpose reading this book would serve you 
 she is doo doo poo poo she is doo doo poo poo 1 cent discs she should give all her money back to the people she scamme 
 I read the reviews and everyone said this was a great piece of work. Well I agree that it was a peice of something but I won't go into that. This album is nothing but noise. There is no rythum to the album what-so-ever. It sounds like a band that just gets together and each person does thier own thing and records it. Absolutely horrible in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and get something like Full Blown Chaos. As for this album, save your money 
 I didn't think this would be a bible study book!  If you're not into reading bible quotes on nearly every page, bypass this book!  Felt like I wasted an afternoon 
 When i got this candle i was very excited, but when i lit it, it seemed to make a scent that strongly smelled of fart. When i put it out, the fart smell went away 
 but quite often the asides in the book appear to be what is found on the internet.Many of the entries for director and sometimes actors are incorrect. This makes the cross referencing mentioned above useless. 
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 Most people buy biographies because they have an existing interest in that star and want to get more of an insight into that particular personality. This book provides absolutely no new revelations into this talented actress. Instead we are forced to be the audience to David's views on each and every film and how he feels she could have done better/worse etc. There are very few interviews with people that have worked with her, few details about why she made her films choices, how the films were put together, and how she has become such a bankable star. He quotes from other magazine and interviews she has done, which we all have access to, and talks like he knows her intimately even though it is revealed they only spoke for a few minutes on the phone. I understand this was an unauthorised biog, but surely there could have been some proper investagative journalism and research done to provide the reader with new information on Nicole, instead of boring us with his own theories. Shame on you David! We bought this book to learn more about Nicole not about you.  
 I've been a Sandra Brown fan for many years - and still am - however, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback.  This was definitely not her best work.  Try your library first 
 The book is convincingly argued, but the recommended supplements had no effect on me whatsoever, even though the book says the effects appear within minutes 
 I skimmed through the book and found it to be of little meaning.  There did not appear to be any substance to it.  I sent it back for refund.  I have never returned a book before this one.  I am not sure why this book was published.  Try again.  
 A number of people have stated that this is the weakest of Stevie Ray Vaughan's CD's.  When that many people make a comment like that, it is important to take notice.  Reviews on Amazon are skewed towards the high end (the average review is 4 stars).  Typically, reviewers on Amazon write reviews on the things they love.  This CD is certainly different than any of Vaughan's other work.  It is mostly, shorter, less emotional tunes.  It comes closer to rock/pop, if anything of his is close to pop/rock.  Also different is that the band includes keyboards and sax.  This shouldn't impact the quality of the music; it all depends on how they are used.  The original CD started out fairly well, but declined as it moved on.  The last half was mostly a waste.  If you bought this as an LP, you would never play side 2.    There are some very good tracks on this CD.  It starts out with the very energetic Say What.  Gone Home is a very nice blues instrumental featuring the keyboards.  This is an example how the new instruments have added some depth to the band.  Also good are Look At Little Sister and Ain't Gonna Give Up on Love.  Which feature some nice blues vocals and guitar work from Vaughan.  The rest of the tracks are emotionally flat and sometimes just tedious.  The addition of the honky tonk piano on some the tracks sounds of place and just poorly played.  The CD has come out in a remastered version with some bonus tracks.  There is a one minute track of Vaughan talking, followed by Little Wing/Third Stone From the Sun.  This is an interesting track, but not worth buying this CD.  You can also get a similar version of those 2 tracks on the 4 CD set SVR.  The final track is one minute of Vaughan fooling around on the slide guitar.  With the additional tracks, the total length of the CD comes to about 57 minutes (up from the original 39).  This was the first album I bought by Vaughan after my friends raved about him.  It almost turned me off of Vaughan completely.  Then I tried some other albums, like Couldn't Stand The Weather, and changed my mind.  Many people might like this album, for it's light, unemotional tracks.  But, many people hate to be challenged and enjoy white bread.    
 With all of the hype surrounding the talented Jack White (and some of the other musicians in the Racontuers), you would expect a solid album from this side project......unfortunately, the album does not deliver.  No one song sticks out for me as anything special.....the band just does not seem to have the same stripped-down, raw, bluesy feeling of the Stripes.  Bottom line, this is a side project that will not likely succeed.  N.B. - I saw these guys play live at the 2006 Virgin Fest near Baltimore, MD.....they were disapointing.  However, another band that played Virgin Fest, Wolfmother, got the crowd into it and played a hard, driving, and deep set.  
 While I didn't partiularly care for this book, I can see how others might like it.  I'm not a big fan of fake meat products, and this book has an over abundance of recipies featuring processed "meat" analogs.  I very rarely use this book for this reason.  That being said, I do enjoy her baked goods section.  So, if you don't mind the vegetarian "meat," you may like this book, but if you don't like it either, then you may want to go with her other cookbook, "the Soy of Cooking," which tends to use more vegetables, temph and tofu rather than "meat. 
 For twenty years or longer, Martha Grimes has been one of my favorite mystery writers.  Furthermore, in recent years, particularly in her Emma Graham series, she has emerged as an eloquent and graceful wordsmith.  Her ability to create a mood, from sleepy and laid-back to threatening to comical, with a few well-placed impressionistic brush strokes sets her apart from other writers of the genre.  Unfortunately, her emergence as a word stylist has been more than offset by her decline as a constructor of plots.  There is almost enough of a story line here for an economical, 200-page novel.  Almost.  Unfortunately, what we get is nearly 400 pages with no plot resolution; the story merely proceeds to a point and stops.  I assume that Part 2 will be forthcoming -- for another 20 bucks, of course.  Instead of a completed narrative, we're treated to half a story and a whole boatload of filler.  She gives us one too many performances of "Medea: The Musical." It only works once per book, Ms. Grimes!  Ditto the upstairs visits to alcoholic Aunt Aurora; the cab rides with the moronic Delbert; the trips to the diner in Cold Flat Junction, the musings on what lies beyond the line of trees at the horizon; the put-downs of Ree-Jane; the sabotaging of Miss Bertha's meals; and on and on and on. I often found myself thinking, "Not another one!"  Since Ms. Grimes' latest Richard Jury novel, The Old Wine Shades, suffers from the same defects as Belle Ruin -- no plot resolution and reams of marginally relevant filler -- I conclude that she has made some sort of deal with the devil to serialize her novels.  Furthermore, the multiple editing errors that other reviewers have noted indicate the same thing - that Ms. Grimes is now cranking out her books assembly-line style, a la Tom Clancy.  What a shame.  What a loss 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Here's the scoop:  The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added.  That's only part of the problem.  David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice.  If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort.  Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part.  Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention.  However, her parts are very small.  I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem 
 Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon "chloroform in print" and he wasn't kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).    Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a "glass looker" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use "magic stones" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found "gold plates" and used what he called the "Urim and Thum" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).    There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church "most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...  I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the "power of prayer".  There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people "prayed" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted).  
 If you like the "women make a mess of their lives but survive it anyway" type of book, you might like this.  Personally, I'm tired of that same old sad song of women choosing to let themselves become whiney victim love songs 
 I have read hundreds of paranormal romances and this one just does not have it at all.  Besides the numerous spelling errors, the story line  is trite, the character development weak and the conversation inane and unbelieveable.  The idea isn't bad but the story development is amaturish and the contact between the two is like child and mentor rather than lover.  None of the love scenes were believeable in even a remote manner.  They seem to have been taken from other stories so therefore lacked power.  It cost way too much for the lack of worthy story.  If you want to give Offen a try, borrow the book from someone or the library. Don't waste your money.  I purchased this and the second in the series which I am not going to read.  I'll give it to the half price book store and let someone else suffer through the stories.   
 Alright lets see i was in sixth grade when faces of death came out and ever since then ive heard bonethugs and LOVED them. Thug world order may have room for improvement but other than that I LOVE THEM. Then came Bone Brothers AND TOTALLY CHANGING THE STYLE. I mean they lost there characteristics which is to me what made them most important icons. A new style th originators how you gonna go copy all of todays BULL. I like one song on this cd "Everyday" nothing else is really even worth a mentio 
 I wasn't impressed by his jazz style on this CD.  I really liked another of his discs - that's why I tried this one 
 Hate-filled people attract or convince very few people. At least this book is up-front about its level of rhetoric 
 I was disappointed in this book.  The title should have been something like, "A Lady Does or Does Not . . . ."  The book gives many "lady" imperatives, but does not give as many specifics on "HOW to Be a Lady." An example is the imperative, "A lady knows when it is acceptable to drink through a straw."  That's it; there is no further information as to the next obvious question:  When is it acceptable for a lady to drink through a straw?  Also it bothered me about some incorrect grammar.  I know that "a lady does not correct another's grammar," but in these published words, someone fell down on the job of editing.  There were several instances of incorrect subject-verb agreement.  One would expect a lady to know better or know that she needs aid in the written English before putting ink to published page.  Overall this book is too simplistic and does not live up to the title of "HOW To Be a Lady."   
 I was hoping this book would be a bit more concrete in suggestions and ways to do exactly what the title implied, but I found it to be too free spirited and 'out there' for my personal liking.  It just wasn't enough to motivate me to give it even 5 bad minutes each morning 
 Here's some brutal honesty: I am too dumb to keep track of all of the characters and clues in this novel. I had to mark pages and underline things and then kept flipping back and forth so I could follow along. So I'm probably not the best person to write a review .... I probably missed the whole point of it, or misunderstood something, confusing person A with person B, clue 1 with clue 2. Humbling, very humbling 
 I tried this one based on other submitted reviews and was sorely disappointed. Where were the scares? A little trippy, it hints at being a countercultural horror film: Easy Rider on Vampire Island.  Interior monologue from our heroine, Jessica, reflects her insecurities about what her friends will think of her, but offer no insights into her mental illness. This is the film's one and only device. And the filmmakers have no idea what to do with it.  BORING 
 This book is chock full of photos; so much that it detracts from providing information.  I was trying to use it to replace a leaking shower faucet, but couldn't find any useful info about my setup.  All there was were pictures of valves that weren't mine.  I would like to see more troubleshooting chapters, and more possible fitting/material variations outlined.  For instance I would like to know how to go from plastic to copper to galvanized etc.    Still if you doing a new install and have access to the exact material they use then it is good for that 
 I have lived in El Salvador now for over eight years.  To visit El Salvador for three days and continue to make a profit on those three days -past- seems completely immoral to me, especially since the book remains in print and continues to influence the world's opinion of El Salvador.  I find this completely unfair.  Would it be possible for Joan or Oliver or anyone else that enjoyed an income from the events of 20+ years ago to come back and revise their assesment?  It would probably cost them all of two or three thousand dollars for the trip, but of course, it would stop the thousand if not million dollars in sales of these recollections which were wish fullfilling fantasies to begin with.  All of El Salvador suffered during this time, why perpetuate the suffering?  And what about any three days in any given city in North America?  Could'nt the "glass is half empty" scenario be drawn to horrify any sensible person from every wanting to visit there, simply by selectively clipping the daily paper?  I think so. 
 It's not an item to write home about.  Final picture quality is usually OK but not spectacular.  The wi-fi works some days, mostly not.  If I'd known then what I know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser. 
 As a Christmas gift, I received the book *Dojo Wisdom for Writers* by Jennifer Lawler, a Tae Kwon Do practitioner who makes a living as a freelance writer--largely writing about martial arts (viz, this book, a similar one for mothers, a couple "Dummies" books, etc.).  Being as this was given to me, a wannabe writer, by a relative who's taken up a martial art, there's no doubt Ms. Lawler nailed a market niche.  Kudos to her on that.  The book itself is a pretty vapid collection of fortune-cookie wisdom stretched awfully thin to connect maxims from contemporary martial arts training to the pursuit of paying writing gigs.  I've always found attempts to extrapolate general life lessons--or even worse, business strategies (shudder)--from Asian martial philosophies pretty tedious.  An investment banker who quotes Sun-Tzu (and I've met a few) just seems like a yutz to me.  Simply because you know what someone said, or what some translator said they said, doesn't mean you understand what was meant well enough to shoehorn it into any context you like.  The value of a piece of advice lies not in who said it or why, but in what it inspires you to do (I think I got that from a SpongeBob cartoon).  As for this book, there are tidbits of practical wisdom ostensibly gleaned from martial arts practice that basically boil down to the importance of perseverence, but there's really nothing of concrete value to a would-be professional writer.  No technical advice on diction or syntax.  No samples of successful query letters.  No recommendations for constructing character-defining dialog, or avoiding hackneyed descriptions, or arranging plot points.  Acutal disscussion of craft is beyond the scope of this book.  Interestingly, Ms. Lawler 'fesses up that she originally wanted to write fiction but gave it up for more saleable magazine articles.  She's a writer in the same way that a guy who makes a good living narrating fire saftey videos is an actor.  In a nutshell, she's someone who figured out a way to retool her interests into a career pumping out disposable little volumes filled with personal anecdotes and shallow observations--even elevating herself to "brand" status (the Holy Grail of trade publishing) in the process.  That's certainly an impressive professional achievement; don't mean her books are all that great.  You could say I'm just envious.  Durn right, I am 
 When this book came out it garnered a lot of respect within the poker world. Even today his section on the standard deviation and it's importance to poker players understanding how good or bad they can run just as a function of luck  as well as "non-self weighting poker ideas" are still considered required reading by many players..   Unfortunately, much of the rest of the book is outdated and of little use to today's players: He discusses lowball and jacks or better draw, he discusses "bingo", he talks about the "new games" of PaiGow and Pan 9. This book is almost 19 years old now much of the original text is outdated or obsolete. Another section that seems a bit suspect is his discussion of tournaments. Although it contains some interesting mathematical ideas, it seems of little use in the "real" world of tournament poker. The fact that Malmouth chooses not to play in tournaments has stirred controversy over the years from those whose primary involvement in poker is tournaments. This text( with the noted exceptions in paragraph one) is in need of an overhaul in my opinion and is not much more than an interesting philosophical or theoretical overview of gambling. One other section that is actually of value is his review of many of the popular gambling and poker titles by other writers. A number of players I have talked with like this section the best as it gives them direction in their book reading and buying decisions 
 Would have given "0" stars on this one.  Boring and lacks any direction 
 These are nice amethyst earrings, nice purple color. However I'm returning them because they're too big for my ears. The basket setting makes them stick out too much. The setting is not very pretty. The gems are set very low into the basket 
                                    				ANTHONY JOHNSTON  						JAN. 11, 2007  		 "BREAKING THROUGH"   BOOK  REVIEW                                                              	 The book is "Breaking Through"   and the author is Francisco Jimenez. The main person in the book is the author. It is a true story. He has a mom, dad and brother. His brother's name is Roberto. I thought it would be a good book because the first sentence was "I lived in constant fear for ten long years."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You shouldn't read this book because there are a lot of Spanish words. The book is very long. It has 195 pages in the book. The Spanish words are very hard to read and you can't understand them.                                                                                                                 The characters were papa, mama; Roberto and Francisco. They live on a farm or tent. Papa and mama are the mom and dad. Roberto is the brother. Francisco is the author and character in the book.     There are pictures of the author in the back of the book. The Jimenez's lived on a farm or tent. They grew up poor in America. They lived in a tent in America.      This book is very hard to read and it's long. The whole book is Francisco's life. I'd liked to sum up by saying I still don't like the book because I couldn't understand the words. In less you like reading Spanish you shouldn't read this book.  
 Wolf's religious conversion to the anti-choice cult winning citations from Priests for life among other seedy sources makes her a good candidate for sermonizing at a Promise Keeper rally. Wolf is a charlatan, whose moral  dictates are cheap and limited to mystics. The pulpy format of this  paperback compliments it's content 
 This is all around a pretty mediocre, uninspired exposition of quantum field theory.  More recent works by Weinberg and Peskin & Schroder, for example, are far more coherent and elegant 
 As a serious amateur woodworker who has also studied the design and building of wooden boats, let me say that beechwood is by far one of the inferior materials one could choose for making wooden spoons.  Olivewood is by far the superior material for this sort of common yet critical kitchen tool. Should you doubt this, please visit the kitchens of France, Italy and Spain to see what's stirring the pot.   Additionally, fabricating the spoon by gluing multiple pieces together is a lesson in engineering failure. It violates the most basic principles of woodworking.  Wood, because it is made by nature and not man is not uniform.  Wood not only expands and contracts as it heats and cools, but also as it draws up moisture and dries.  Multiple pieces equals multiple rates of expanding and contracting, working against the glued joint.   While Oxo makes and sells some very fine kitchen tools (I have a vegetable peeler by them that's the best I've ever owned and it's about a decade old), this is sure not among them.  A product to avoid 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 Sufficient movie to waist a couple hours downtime here in Afghanistan. That's it though 
 I won't go into a synopsis of the story since that's been done quite enough already here. I bought the book because I was looking for a Regency that was a bit steamy but this book is really only for someone who enjoys the steam and not the story.  I have a lot of trouble with writers who place their stories in an historic era without doing any research nor enhancing the story in any way besides throwing in a carriage ride here or a quizzing glass there.  Suffice it to say that there is very little historical value to this book and nothing really that would tie it to any distinctive era of history.  The characters were interesting enough, but I found myself skimming quite often and lost interest after the 2nd steamy scene, somewhere around page 15 or so.   Why oh why do good writers like Ms. Hunter insist on skipping the essence of a story in favour of over-abundant sex scenes!   Romance is supposed to be just that. Regency says enough as well.  This book has little of either.   I'm giving her two stars because she is obviously capable of more and hopefully will one day deliver.  
 I got this book because it was highly recommended by a college professor.  I thought that it was entirely too wordy.  I would skip through paragraphs because it was just too much.  I thought the story plot was interesting and could have been fun to read, but Tom Robbins came off sounding pretentious because of his overuse of words.  It could have been much better.  
 One has to admire Wittig for persisting. _The Lesbian Body_ is an extended love letter from one Amazon (not an Amazon.com!) to the woman she loves. The book can have an intermittently disconcerting fascination, and it is agreeably off putting, with first person pronouns divided up ("m/e" [and in the French version "j/e"]), presumeably to break down language false to the lesbian self and the experience of love the book wishes to embody. Moreover, the attraction of the narrator for her inamorata is not confined to anything like usual romantic palaver; it can derive from, say, sweat. It is often expressed in violence. "Under m/y frantic pressure your head becomes detached at the level of the cervical vertebrae." I guess this is love, if between consenting adults.  I don't find the new language _more_ satisfactory or illuminating; it is just different, for the sake being so, nor for me does feminizing the characters in the _Iliad,_ as _The Lesbian Body_ does, add to an understanding of them or make the stories alluded to more moving, entertaining, true, or, given the sketchiness of the references, much unlike what they were in Homer.  Interrupting the paeans of love, at apparently arbitrary points, are lists of body parts, often sounding like extracts from a medical textbook. "THE DORSALS THE ILIACS THE TERES THE QUADRATI." Is this the inevitability of the phsyical? Or a remaking of love in a way the outside, non-revolutionary world will or must find foreign?  The best that can be said about this experiment is that, like the writing of Gertrude Stein, it can shake the reader out of traditional ideas of fiction or writing and bust up stale social notions. By the last page, 165, I had had enough. It was actually more fun to write this review than to read the book 
 This book was smaller than a post-it note.  I was very disappointed when I received this lilliputian sized thing.  I (obviously) could not use this book during reading time for my students.  I recommend that "odd" book sizes be disclosed in the description/condition. This was a waste of my money! 
 Curtis White's diatribe against the usual suspects is mostly unreadable waffle, but it's worth browsing through the few lucid sections where he stops trying to decide whether Derrida made the world a better place and takes specific works of popular culture to task. His merciless demolition of Saving Private Ryan is hilarious, his dismissal of American Beauty less so. Mildly diverting is his hagiography of David Lynch and Blue Velvet.   Discussing Radiohead's Kid A, he flays Nick Hornby for his (widely shared) opinion that Radiohead's follow-up to OK Computer was, musically speaking, rubbish. I can't agree with Hornby on Kid A's musical merits (Everything In Its Right Place, In Limbo and Morning Bell are wonderful tunes to my ears) but that's just my mileage varying. I take more serious issue with White, who thinks that all we have any business caring about when judging Kid A are its iconoclasm, its motivating philosophy, and the form (not the content) of its music. For White, the merits of the music _as music_ don't come into it. What a philistine argument. If the tunes on Kid A were no good, all the rest would be completely moot.  The rest of the book pads out these morsels with the kind of self-important bilious rambling that lacks the discipline to make any sort of memorable point. Blecch. 
 Who the **ck are GNR?? Plus they make awful music! I can't stand this annyoing album. The music is awful, so as the lyrics. There is not ONE good song on this piece of s**t. It is a album that contains 12 crappy songs. AXL ROSE is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly, and SLASH is terrible too. In THE WAY STAY AWAY FROM THIS AS WELL AS GNRS OTHER ALBUMS. LEAVE GNR ALONE....GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS.

 This is the first mystery series with cats I didn't like.  Cats that speak English????  File it in fantasy, not mystery.  I like my cats to act like normal cats, with the humans requiring *some* intelligence or curiosity.  I think the author jumped on the bandwagon for some quick money in a proven genre.  I wouldn't buy another one...or even borrow it from the library 
 I've been taking an intensive German translation course this summer and because I haven't taken any German before this, I didn't have any vocabulary coming into it.  I bought this book as a supplement because I wanted to have as many resources as possible to get through class.  My problem with it has been that most of the verbs I've tried to look up haven't been in it.  I've only found a few of the verbs I've tried to look up.  Part of this, however, has to do with the compound nature of German, and another part has to do with the fact that 501 really isn't that many verbs in the grand scheme of linguistics.  If you're learning German for fun or to travel, this book would probably be pretty helpful, but if you're learning the language for academics or for a field of work with a specialized vocabulary, you won't find everything you need in it 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 I am all in favor of a simple, clutter free and low maintenance house, but really!  This book should have a subtitle, "How to build a sterile, ugly house"  or perhaps, "How to make your house even less appealing than a hospital waiting room."  This book with tell you how to avoid any and all dust traps, like comfy furniture, artwork, or architectural features.  It's great if you want your living room to look like the set of Star Trek, but not so great if you want you home to be . . . well . . .a HOME 
 So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value.   Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.    About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.  
 The author is completely wrong when it comes to her statements about breastfeeding.  She also is in favor of a 9-month-old crying it out, and claiming that babies who cry at that age are manipulative (even Dr. Ferber softened his view!)  Again, what disturbed me the most was her inaccurate information about breastfeeding.  Obviously, she chose to wean her babies at a very young age, and wanted to justify her decision.  Instead, I recommend Dr. Sears's, "The Breastfeeding Book", "So That's What They're For" (Janet Tamaro), or "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding" for accurate, medically-sound information with regards to breastfeeding. 
 I grew up reading the Chip Hilton books and loved every one of them.  A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books.  If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important.  The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times 
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 This may be a fine book for parenting/motherhood, but it is not Lao Tzu's tao te ching.  His classic text has broad applications to many areas of life, but the stretch to motherhood is too great 
 I can't give it any less than one star but what the heck, The girls were hot so there's the one star. Other than that I am literally dumber after watching this movie! I swear to god! I passed out after watching this film because I got so stupid I forgot to breathe! They should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job! Even if they just ran around the set yelling "1,2,3, Potato Salad, March!" The dialogue would have been 1000 times better. Message to the producer: Give it up loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I thought this was by far the worst baby/child development book I have ever read, and I've read at least 100 of them! The author's know it all tone is offensive, which is not even as bad as how uninformed she is! She doesn't bother to use research, evidence based medicine or site any sources in her "expert advice." I got so tired of the "let the child be" (don't touch, don't help, don't play, etc etc) mantra that I literally had to put the book down many times so it didn't annoy me so much. 
 This book was good but not terrific. after reading best sellers like Why we want you to be rich by Donald TRump and God Doesn't run a $2 Shop by Sage Saint Francis i found that this book just was not in the same leauge.  This book just did not cut it, i mean those two books changed my life, and actually got me the result and financial freedom i was after but they are not for everyone.  I found this information to be very simple and at times misleading...at best!  I do not feel this is the authors best work, however i still believe it is a good investment and a descent place to start. 
 This is a Vocal Selections book, not the Vocal Score (as is clear from the large photo of the cover) 
 I gotta admit I'm a bit surprised at how generously people are rating this album.  I bought it because people raved about it so much.  My wife and I listened to it on our drive to Indianapolis this weekend and ... we found it very lackluster.  I'm not saying all other reviews here are WRONG, I'm glad they enjoyed it.  However, this album pales in comparison to other works out there.  It simply doesn't measure up to the likes of Todd Barry or Mitch Hedburg.  Not even close.    It is an uncommonly clean album which is nice to see once in a while but I still just can't ignore that it didn't make me laugh much.  It went beyond being clean into JUST PLAIN NON-THREATENING and I wonder if that's what some like about it.  I would love to see more comedians out there who can do "clean" material that still sets people on edge.    As for this album, I simply can't recommend it.  It feels very dated even though it's only from 1997.  (Carlin has stuff from the 70s that feel TIMELESS.  That will never be the case with Regan's album.)  He is not the skilled writer or performer on par with other guys out there.  But that's my experience with the album.  IF it absolutely makes someone else's day brighter, that's great 
 After listening to the great John Fogerty's latest album, I had the same type of feeling I used to have the day after Christmas. The anticipation was always more fun than the day itself. With only ten tracks, and none of them what could be called outstanding, "Dï¿½jï¿½ vu  (All Over Again)" is oddly disappointing. I didn't want it to be, it just is.  There are four or five fairly good songs, with the title song being the best. "Radar" and "Honey Do" for instance, both have a catchy rhythm and are fun to listen to the first several times. Unfortunately, I grew tired of both songs rather quickly because the lyrics aren't up to par with the music. In fact, it would not be a stretch to say that the lyrics make John sound more like a hen-pecked husband than a legendary rock star. The strange thing is that Fogerty's voice is as good as ever. It's the mundanity of the material that disappoints. "Rhubarb Pie" is pleasant enough, but doesn't hold up well after a dozen or so listens. "I Will Walk With You" and "Sugar-Sugar (In My Life)" are two of the more pleasant surprises, somewhat gentle country rock tunes that John does well.  "In the Garden" features some heavy drums and guitars and it's fine if you like that sort of thing - "Woodstock" music if you will.  Sometimes it's fun to listen to. Other times, it's jarring. Given the magnificence of John's last release, "Blue Moon Swamp" perhaps I'm just expecting too much. All I can say is I've listened to "Blue Moon Swamp" hundreds of times and I never grow tired of it.  "Dï¿½jï¿½ vu (All Over Again)" on the other hand just continues to gather dust. 
 This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers.  It's as if he published this because he needed money.  There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.  I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up 
 The plot of this book was interesting, and it could have been a good book. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable, and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem! Even many of the the secondary characters are weak, miserable people!  The story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a "dirty little nobody". Once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful, he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards. Because she is the daughter of a "cit", he can't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal. He says charming things to her like "how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway". Now that's romance!   Meanwhile, even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times, she finds herself drawn to him too. For me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim. She never stood up for herself, and you felt sorry for her.  Of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage... only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a Dukes granddaughter, including her. In fact just about the only one who doesn't know is the hero, which provides the dilemma. He would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn't a nobody!  Will anyone tell him? Will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she isn't good enough for him? Will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn't think she is good enough for him to marry? Of course it all works out, and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him. Ugh!!!  This could have been a good book if the "mystery" had been handled better, and the characters were written differently. As is, it is a sad regency tale 
 Ok, I know that sounds awfully bad, but despite having loved Laymon's other books like Island and Funland, this book - in the end - totally repelled me.   The book starts out very promising, delivering what the backcover promises almost instantly: poor Jody gets a nasty surprise. The writing is awesome, the story so far very scary and believable. But then Jody gets away and the story just falls apart. In my opinion, because from this point on the nerdy, psychopath killer gets a voice in the book and the reader gets to read nothing but disturbing stories about how he rapes and murders people, and yes, all in very graphic detail.   What's left of Jody's story - the emotional aftermath and her relationships with her father and the other survivor - is suddenly used to fill up the void between the killer's stories, which seems to have become the main thread in the book. But in the meantime, the killer's actual pursuit of Jody goes slow and is without excitement - that is, without the good 'hide and seek/will he get her?!' kind, but with plenty of the sick 'look at me, I'm raping and stabbing people for 3 hours at a time!' kind - and let me tell you, those 'war' stories, go on and on. Up to the point where it got so pathetic, I got bored. By the time I finally got to those final pages I'd been waiting for since page 80-something, I'd already pretty much lost my interest.   All in all, that leaves about 150 of interesting pages and about 300 too sad and laughable sick ones. Not a great deal, if you ask me. 
 I have been a subscriber to TIME for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. It pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. Frankly, the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters.  A newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. Unfortunately TIME fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove TIME's initial position correct. The immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--"we told you so, we told you so." Even worse, the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. Can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? Out of sight, out of mind is the mantra...  In fact, I sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing, television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic, even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. We seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis.  Neutrality is dead. Frankly, I don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as I do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. TIME used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the United States--no more. Iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. African states are making vast strides towards democracy, we get an article about Nigerian computer fraud. Russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy, but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in Iraq. Japan, one of the world's most influential cultures, in the week I originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. Somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which TIME could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership, instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of Joel Stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. But most damning is the fact that after reading TIME one asks: How in the hell did our world become boring?  Can TIME try emulating The Economist rather than The Enquirer? Someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. TIME has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine, if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news 
 An interesting, well researched book about Robert Schomburgk's attempts to obtain a place for himself in history within the context of setting forth British Guiana's borders using the science and land surveying techniques available to him in the 19th century.  The prose of book, however, is what native Guyanese would call 'high falautin' and, toward the end, I disagree with a few of his political theories on modern Guyanese politics;  moreover, significantly, there is some repetition.  In the end, Graham adds a human and scientific aspect to the discourse concerning the disputed boundaries.  The editors should have allowed for a rewrite and/or the author should not have rushed to market or allowed for more maturity.  I would recommend the paperback 
 This is the second Edelman book I've read, which was supposedly for a popular, albeit educated, audience, and like "Wider Than The Sky", I found his prose uniquely bad and off-putting. I've read loads of books now on the mind, from Searle, the Churchlands, Fodor, Pinker, Ramachandran, Gazzaniga, et al, and all of them are able to express themselves clearly even when discussing sophisticated concepts. But for me, reading anything by Gerald Edelman is a terrible chore - like some crazy reading comprehension test devised by a sadist - rather than an exciting journey through a brilliant mind. Indeed, I wondered a few times reading this book if Edelman might even feel a perverse pride in keeping his writing below the average standards of intelligibility.  Australian philospher David Stove once remarked that he very much appreciated the contributions of John Stuart Mill, because while (he thought) Mill was wrong, his ideas were expressed with great clarity, allowing them to be more easily evaluated (which in turn facilitated greater understanding). Edelman must be a smart man, so I wish he was able to more effectively communicate his ideas. When so many of his colleagues can do it, I don't know why he can't.  Addendum Mar. 10, 2007: I just read John Horgan's book "The End of Science", and was surprised to find a section on none other than Edelman himself. I was even more surprised (and frankly, sort of thrilled) by the quotes there from Edelman's peers (like Daniel Dennett and the late Francis Crick), on the incomprehensibility of Edelman's gobbledygook (in the back of my mind I was still wondering whether it was just me...). In fact, one fellow scientist expresses his judgment that Edelman tries to disguise unoriginal ideas through the use of rhetorical bluster, pedantry, and new names. 
 Having spent most of my adult life working in the non-profit conservation field, and as a parent, and as someone who had the good fortune to spend lots of time in nature as a child, I read this book in the hopes of learning important things. That turned out to be a forlorn hope.  By a quarter of the way through I was rolling my eyes; by the halfway mark I was actively insulted that this author would expect anyone to buy what he was shoveling. I finished the thing only out of grim curiosity.  Louv has about three major points: (a) American kids circa 2005 are much less active outdoors than American kids circa 1965 were; (b) that change is due to computers, personal-injury lawyers, and various other things that people Louv's age don't like; (c) being "in nature" is important to kids' development and to human health generally.  Point (c) is blindingly obvious, is not news to anyone, and is the only major point for which he offers any actual evidence which wouldn't get laughed out of the offices of a peer-reviewed journal.  For points (a) and (b) he offers zero evidence, nada, zip -- absolutely nothing but anecdotes, leading rhetorical questions, and straw men. He sounds like nothing so much as Joseph McCarthy wondering whether Communists "might be" undermining American foreign policy from within the State Department. Indeed he uses precisely that rhetorical construction repeatedly, always a signpost of intellectual flabbiness.  Obvious logic flaws abound, as do laugh-out-loud factual mistatements. In the first half of the book I started jotting down glaring holes in his argument but gave up in disgust when I realized that most of his factual claims weren't even footnoted! Louv isn't even consistent in his straw men: one moment he's talking about when he was a child (1960s, roughly) and the next moment he's quoting somebody talking about how much kids were outdoors in 1910, or 1860!  While he offers no actual evidence for his broad proposition of a new "nature deficit disorder", he does throw tangential facts around some of which I am in a professional position to quickly confirm. I checked a half-dozen such, and the score was that he got 1 substantially correct, distorted 2 beyond recognition, and got 3 dead wrong.  I could go on but enough already. This thing isn't worth the paper it was printed on 
 I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:  1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the "my life sucks" and "everyone hates me" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done  Anyone want to buy a used CD 
  This book doesn't even deserve a star. I just fell upon it, on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house. I'm nearly 17 years old, and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older, but honestly, I don't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years... I've read so many reviews raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry I don't see it!  Anyone can write a bunch of sex stories. I didn't see anything poetic in the writing...it was plain. As for sensual and arousing? Hardly. It was crude, and vulgar. It was sex, sex, sex... and presented harshly, with none of the sensuality, the sweetness, the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex... it was boring, repetitive, and I'll admit disturbing.  What was the point of the story where the Hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children? Or the raped little boy? It was just weird. There's just the sex, and no development of any points she may be trying to make. It's kind of just left there...unfinished... unsatisfying. Frankly, it was so distasteful (VULGAR), I was shocked. And I'm not religious, puritan, conservative or any such thing...quite the opposite, I have an open mind. But this book left me cold 
 These shakers are adorable. Very small and cute... BUT, unless you look closely at them, it's very easy to mix them up. My husband has fits over them and swears he'll find a way to mark them "S" and "P" if I don't switch them out. Often we'll use the larger range shakers by Fiesta instead of these. Buy the range shakers instead of these if you can find them. I bought mine from Amazon 
 Once again Frankie Jay does his best to impersonate the true latin music genius Jon Secada and once again his whiny delivery makes you want to work at a nursery because the sound of 42 babies screaming at the same time would be more appealing than this pilth. Secada churned out true american classics like "Just another day" and "Angel" while Spankie J turns out garbage that makes Gwen Stefani sound like Sarah McLachlan. I was on a date with yet another hot girl and she brought this disc on the date thinking she could control the CD deck in my ride. She puts it in and I ask her to point out one redeeming quality to this CD. She says he sings with heart. I flat told her I owned all of heart's albums and never heard his sorry voice on any of them. I dropped her off at her house and told her that I don't date girls who like Frankie J even if they're hot. I ended up calling the next girl in the black book and she cancelled all of her plans to spend some time with the nook. She and I laughed for hours at the thought of this guy being compared to Secada. We then threw on some classic Hasselhoff and had relations the rest of the night. I am one seriously smooth and cool guy 
 The fact that Sowell is a black man criticizing other blacks doesn't make him any more right or less racist.   The fact that he perpetuates anti-Southern bigotry and invents a connection with ghetto culture and Southern culture doesn't seem to turn anybody off. What he fails to acknowledge is the true connection with criminal behavior and that is institutionalized urban poverty, not Southern culture.   FBI statistics prove this repeatedly.  I don't think Sowell really knows any rednecks.  I grew up in the South; most of my youth was spent in a very small town in a rural county where I was surrounded by rednecks.   I will grant you that they dislike intellectualism (which made me really unpopular) but they weren't any more violent than anywhere else, and in fact I'm often appalled by stories I've heard from friends' kids about the kinds of things that go on in schools now, and I don't live in North Carolina any more.   The rednecks I grew up around, the vast majority of them had very strong Christian faith, and they worked hard even if (usually especially if) they were poor - just like the vast majority of folks who are in the ghettos.  They dislike shows of money and are extremely thrifty to the point of being just plain cheap, which is a stereotypical Scottish/Irish value that Sowell conveniently ignores.  The other positive value we Southerners have retained that everyone else seems to have forgotten is basic manners.  After I left college and moved out of the South I was appalled at the general lack of basic consideration for other people, who didn't greet you on the street or even use "please" and "thank you."  Last, I challenge anyone to prove that Southerners are overall more violent than the rest of the nation, especially given per capita crime rates are much lower in rural areas and the South is mostly rural.  I'm disappointed that only two people seem to be approaching this book with a critical mind, out of over 60 reviewers, and I'm especially disappointed at all the people who continue to applaud    such bigotry.   How long has the Civil War been over?   Not one of you remember it but somehow you can't seem to get over it.  In short, Sowell's arguments would be great if they were all based on fact 
 There's no denying that the music on these discs is fabulous (although Ishman Bracey is hardly of the same caliber as Skip James or Son House).  No, the problem with these discs (and JSP discs generally) is that the sound quality is terrible.  Obviously any CDs made from old 78s are going to have loud hiss and pops.  That's to be expected.  What's terrible here is that JSP's solution has, from the sound of it, been to lop off the higher end of the sound, with the result that everything sounds muffled and distant.  It's as though they'd put a heavy blanket over your speakers.  I prefer Yazoo's method, which has more hiss and other noise, but infinitely more clarity and presence.  The difference between JSP's version of Booker T. ("Bukka") White and Yazoo's is like night and day: you'd never know what a subtle vocalist and guitarist he actually was if all you heard were the versions on these discs.  It's even worse with the great Skip James, since in his case the originals are in really bad shape: if you're not careful (and JSP is not), you end up with mud instead of genius.  In short, the remastering has real consequences for what you can hear of the music.  All the nuance is absent on these discs.  Get the Yazoo or the Biograph or the Roots-n-Blues ones instead: you'll have more background noise, but you'll also know why people rave over these musicians in the first place 
 I am a huge fan of Umberto Eco, and his novels (Rose and Foucault's Pendulum) and I had high hopes for this collection of essays. Eco is very satirical in these essays, sometimes too much so; the satirical and exaggerating style that is combined with very unusual translation style (ancient words that do not reach the nice rhythm of Eco's otherwise great storytellin in his other works) just got me tired of reading this book. These stories just do not entertain me this time.  Here and there I was able to find a nice story but only few. Language just doesn't get to its pace, and I also have say that majority of the stories are dated for readers in 2006. Stories about telefaxes, etc. are not relevant anymore. But also the general problem of satirical essays is that they are very much tied to the present day when they're written.  Overall, not a bad collection but nowhere near to my expectations 
 Based on the user reviews, I ordered these knives.  The blades are, as advertised, sharp and well designed.  The handles, however, are very thin and poorly shaped. After a few minutes of slicing strawberries, my hand began to cramp. The knives are very lightweight, which can be a problem because you have to provide all the cutting power yourself. This is one of the very few items I have ever returned to Amazon.    
 It pained me to sit through this movie and I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes if I didn't have to write a comparative analysis between it and Shakespeare's "Othello." The writing is terrible, the acting is so-so, the music is the pits, there is WAY too much emphasis on race, and the relationship between Odin and Desi is a joke. I'm supposed to believe he went stark-raving mad over a girl he had been dating for four months? Give me a break--I ended up laughing through the majority of this movie simply because it was so bad. This is teenaged melodrama at its worst 
 I was really looking forward to reading "Ever After" when I saw the favorable quote on the back cover by  Larry Gelbart. But the book turned out to be a VERY cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight. Here are the three things I learned from this book: (1) Mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) Andrew Lloyd Webber is the anti-Christ; (3) The only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started Off-Broadway (mostly at Playwrights Horizons and Lincoln Center). Most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each, with very few illuminating details. Here's what the author says about "Carrie," perhaps the most famous recent Broadway musical flop: "Carrie, of course, was an instant classic, a monument in the pantheon of failed Broadway musicals. Adapated by Michael Gore (music) and Don Pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious Stephen King novel (and even more notorious film), this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the Virginia Theater on the 12th of May, 1988 and was gone by the 15th, touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible, monumental ineptitude." Does that really tell us very much about this musical? Did Barry Singer even see the show? You sure wouldn't know it from this description. And just what, I wonder, makes King's novel "notorious" or the movie "even more notorious"? Almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention, but somehow Singer finds time for an entire chapter of Lloyd Webber-bashing where Sir Andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery. The chapter sticks out like a sore thumb, if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book, but also because it's one of the few times that Singer goes into any detail. Aside from a few interesting Sondheim quotes, this book is a waste of time. 
 Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:  We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results.  Here is my update, which I wrote November 3:  This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing "the entire internal mechanism" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.  
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 I'm a huge Alton Brown fan. This is one of the books I asked for when my birthday came around. I thought I wanted it after reading the reviews and thought it sounded good. I was very disappointed. While there is some good information in it, it's mostly blank pages that you write your own recipes in w/ your notes. There are a few clear plastic pages so that you can put in recipe clippings and instructions and warranties for various kitchen gadgets, but a simple file folder would solve that. Sadly, I will be returning this book and finding something else to purchase 
 It seemed like this book could have been written in a matter of 50 pages.  Long story short: Cramer's wife taught him what he knows, and bailed him out when he didn't have a clue in 1998.  This guy is a journalist and a marketer, not a great trader 
 This book isn't as fun to read as it might tell you. I try to work on a project and end up getting confused as to which class I'm working on, or where everything fits together. It isn't easy to follow and it just glides through things nonchalantly, but doesn't bother to give a finished product that I can find.  I tried the beginners fish aquarium class, but couldn't get too far because of formatting. Tried the slapshot game and got lost as to which class was which and which code went where. It's great if you want something to sit on your shelf and look pretty, maybe for moderate reference, but not practical or easy enough to read. And this is coming from someone who has read many types of these books in the past. 
 the typical self proclaimed china hand writing books catered to the western audience with typical stories everyone hears if you are in the investing biz.  no added value except to "reveal" to the world what had happened to him or her.  do these writers trully understand china?; same question to be posed to the thousands of current and potential investors into china.  and can they offer insights that are practical, realistic and offers a true fact of what is happening daily on the ground?  i seriously doubt any writer can offer this in respect to china because china is a story of limitless permutations.  there is only one commonality in china, which is its damn hard to get it right, because there is no right or wrong in this environment.  so how does anyone who wants to know how to operate in this environment learn?  i beg to differ, but its not gonna be thru a book written by the gangs of so called "china hands" out there.  these books are like the ones that came out supporting the great hype about the "new ecnomony" when the heat was scorching white.  opportunistic but offers little value.  i'll only buy the soft cover versions of these type of books or reading it as borrowed material. there is absolutely nothing valuable in this type of undertaking other than entertaining one on a slow afternoon. the author doesn't trully understand the reasons why things and events like those that transpired while he was ther in the early 90s, he doesn't understand the deep down psychic of the chinese person that he is dealing with.  chinese as a society is very complicated and extremely difficult to "read", and with the thousands of years of upheavals and sufferings of the masses, a twisted sense of whats right or wrong flows thru to today's society.  understand the meaning of "middle kingdom" and the world will have a starting point on why things are done the way they are today.  understand why "putonghua" has to be implemented  to bring all the different sects of chinese together is also another start.  i have yet to read any of this and a hundred other basic seeds of discontent that creates the china it is of today and why it behaves the way it does.  i doubt that anyone will be able to put it in on paper with  a certain thoroughness as it will create lots of uneasiness and tensions that has been around for 5000 years.  chinese will not accept a book on this and the western reader will have difficulty fathoming the gist and hidden weight behind each nuance.  
 My daughter was turned off by this book because it said all the things not to do and insufficient focus on what to do.   It took less than an hour for her to set it aside.  We need books that motivate kids to do the right thing, not lecture the 
 Reads like it was written by a high school kid.  An annoying high school kid.  I paid almost 14 euros for it in the airport and feel bad 
 This is an OK book, if it's the first of the series one has read.  However, for those who have read Fluke's earlier "Hannah" mysteries, it is a crashing bore.  Hannah, her mother, sister, suitors, etc. are interesting, well-delineated characters.  The problem comes with Fluke's setting: her idyllic, Minnesota village is such a great place that readers of more than one of these cozies know from the outset that the crime was committed by an outsider.  This series has become the most formulaic I have ever read: Hannah will dither between her two suitors, Mom will continue to be charmingly demanding and eccentric, everyone will need block heaters in the Minnesota, and I won't read any more Hannah Swensen mysteries 
 On Amazon.UK the synopsis contains this lovely gem: "the Moon is exactly 400 times smaller than the Sun."  This is false, of course. The diameter of the moon is 400 times smaller than the diameter of the sun; but that does not mean the moon, as a whole, is 400 times smaller. The moon exists in 3 dimensions, not one. For example, the mass of the moon is about 27 million times smaller than the sun.  This is typical of the logic in this book. They go looking for correspondences, and they find them: even if they have to treat celestial objects as one-dimensional to make their numbers look interesting. They simply stir the facts together in a great big soup, until two disassocated numbers look similar. Then they pluck out the pair and declare "Mystery!"  The fact that a book like this could get published is pathetic. If you want science fiction, there's vastly better and more interesting out there; if you want science, there's simply nothing here. If you want baseless, juvenile speculation, then go hang out with your mates on Friday night and have a few beers. It'll be a lot more fun. 
 It really stunk. I've read other Boxcar Children books, but this stun 
 I got the impression that this book was something the publishers asked Father Greeley to dash off in time for Christmas.  Same Irish-American hero from Chicago with large family, same strong heroine that said hero worships.  Yawn.  At least she was Russian this time; that added a bit of interest to the story.  Don't get me wrong, I've read all of Greeley's fiction, am a big fan. It's usually much more interesting, with actual plots and villains and such.  This was just a bland little holiday story 
 Congratulations Carlos, you have somehow managed to soil a title last used for an NSYNC album. That is impressive. This dvd is terrible and offensive to anybody who likes comedy 
 I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy.  For a true Visionary approach to "CranioSacral" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger 
 This book is poorly organized, badly written, and so difficult as to be virtually incomprehensible to all but the most advanced mathematics students. Even the infrequent examples skip so many steps that they are hard to follow. Do not torture yourself with this book unless it is absolutely required - and unless first you have vigorously but unsuccessfully lobbied against its use.  Pair this textbook with a sub-par instructor and you will be living a nightmare.  Surely there is a more user- friendly option available 
 Unfortunately, Blum's work was my first exposure to the Runes. That was several years ago.  Now I have taken up studying Asatru, and am finding that this is the path for me.  It is too bad that many will be exposed to this work, it is full of references to Jesus Christ and Buddha, each of whom have absolutely NOTHING to do with the Odinnic ways or Runecasting. Many would find it offensive to see Teutonic Runes etched onto a crucifix; i feel the same way whenever i see an image of the crucified Christ superimposed on Thor's Hammer. I would give this book Zero stars if allowed. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE SEEKING AUTHENTICITY! Seek out the many works of Edred Thorsson instead 
 Other then "You're Beautiful" and "Wisemen", this is a pretty crappy cd!  James' voice sounds the same in every song.  When I first heard those two songs I thought WOW, this guy's cd must sound fantastic.  I was wrong, really wrong.  I have to agree though that some songs are somewhat catchy, but it's nothing special.  "Voice of an angel" my butt, his voice gets annoying after awhile.  He sounds like he's getting over a cold or something.  Not recommended, unless you're a fan of You're Beautiful and Wisemen, or better yet, download the songs 
 I bought this album on the strength of these reviews-what a mistake. After listening to this comp, I am again truly amazed at the reviews. I understnad that one persons floor is anothers ceiling and all that, but hey... these guys are nowhere even near Bigstar or other bands that I see other reviewers use as a comparrison. Anyway, as a heartfelt sign of the times or nostalgia for people who saw/ know them, maybe this album is great, but for a lot of us who did indeed never hear of them (no surprise there) their music doesn't really stand up to the test of time. Dated? You bet! Musicianship? Basic at best. Coming from someone who likes listening to anyone who puts it on the line- no matter how wavering, I gotta say, if this is their best example, these guys were amateur warblers who came to NYC to just hang out and take in the sites and music scenes. 
 I wanted to enjoy "To Repel Ghosts" so much. I have seen many of Jean Michel basquiats paintings and drawings. He was as poetic visually as he was when writing his thoughts down. Kevin Youngs book suffers because he seems to want to live through Basquiats words...but that is all that they seem to be is words...without soul!!! 
 Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL 
 I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner.  I am not sure if I would read any of her other books.  I do like the fact that it is set in North Carolina, which takes me back home.  I thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me.  It is probably because I couldn't relate to the characters because I just don't live my life in total isolation.  Others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters 
 I respect everyone's opinion in here, and I've tried so hard to love this album because I love Pink Floyd and I see how everyone calls it a classic. But I just do not get it. I highly overrated album IMO. Very childlike and underdeveloped, but maybe that is its charm? I see 2 very different Pink Floyds and I have to say I never got into Syd's style. Matilda this, Lucifer that. The Gnome? come on. Astromony Domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen I'm sorry to say. I'm sure you'll say a true Floyd fan would love this album, well maybe that's true. But for me, when Waters and Gilmour were together, that is the true Floyd IMO. And their reign started with Meddle and ended with the Wall. A brilliant 6 album run (Meddle, OBC, DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, The Wall). For serious collectors, this is a must have and I'll give it 2 stars, but stay away if you expect another 'Wish you were here' purchase, pre-Gilmour can be a tough listen.  
 When a friend and I read the back of the DVD at Blockbuster, we were intrigued by the plot, not to mention the incredible cast.  We checked it out with anticipation of a great flick.  I wouldnt even consider what we were feeling as dissapointment; I would describe what we felt as pure regret!  The acting on the part of Elle McPherson was awful!  The character development in this movie was null and void.  I dont understand how other reviewers can say that this was a fabulous movie depicting real life situations about women...I dont know about you but I dont have internal conflict with everyday lesbian experiences, my mother never tricked me in to thinking I was adopted so that I'd get along with my siblings.  I dont know what happened in the other two 'chapters' because we turned this atrocity of a movie off after 2 hours of pure hell.  If you want to make a movie about womens issues, make a movie about our rights, our health issues, being a mother, etc. This was just a poorly written script with a good cast who couldnt even save it from the depths of the hideousness that is called A Girl Thing 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 This is one of my favorite Tom Clancy novels.  However, I am going to return these cassette tapes because the 4th and last tape broke.  I will ask for a replacement though and not a refund 
 The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it 
 Seen this fellow in concert, have his albums.  Cheb i Sabbah personifies the "Orientalist" mentality described by Edward Said.   He is a poseur 
 Wasn't going to write a review of this, but I felt compelled. The author gave himself 5 stars for a book that I felt was a waste of my money. If you have any higher education or management experience, you need to look elsewhere. If you truly are an "idiot" it might be a good starting point for you. Why would a true idiot need a HRM book, though 
 . . . . . is that it's actually being discussed. I'm pretty down about the fact that I have so few ways in which to usefully spend my time that I am offering an opinion on this excrement. Exploitation of aging film stars is nothing new and if they are willing to be exploited then who am I to complain?; there's nothing objectionable about seeing a naked body on the screen, in my opinion; we all do stupid and regrettable things in our youth and they are, potentially, funny. However, certain crimes against the viewing public are inexcusable, namely the fact that WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE, SO MANY TIMES. I, personally, feel insulted that we are being offered this crud but am also aware of a sense of doom that people are actually getting laughs from the tired, old, flogged cliches (you know, sock over turgid member, lustful older woman, kooky student, BOY WHO REALISES THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS etc., etc., etc). As a final tirade and the most astounding feature of all the reviews that have appeared before is that some so beguiled by their own "insights" that they are reviewing this film in a pseudo-academic manner. I was sure the word "ouvre" (if that's how it's spelt) would appear somewhere. Please, someone, tell me that nobody has yet written a PhD thesis on campus comedy, that most banal of film types. Please!!! Otherwise, truthfully, any pretension that we are an intelligent race may as well be buried once and for all.  Yes, this is a truly terrible film in every sense of the word. It is a "comedy" that is genuinely depressing but we're getting pretty used to being fed swill now, am I right? And some are becoming quite fond of the taste . .  
   Over the years I have had an avid interest in the paranormal.  I have read books by numerous authors, and looked forward to this book being one of the best.  I found however a book that seemed to wander as though lost,and the author was searching for a direction to go with it but never quite found it.  I have taken my law enforcement training and experience, and coupled it with other books on this subject, and found the scientific methods of investigation to be very similar.  I am afraid that this book,apart from the poor spelling, and composition would be confusing to novice investigators, and would give them erroneous information, on a subject that is complicated to begin with.  I am sure Mr.Taylor means well, but there are much better books out there for the beginner,or the experienced investigator. The later version is no real improvement eithe 
 this is a film that teachs you about  not only being a father but how to become a son, about being truthful to your roots and your futur 
 Serves 4-6? A pound of pasta, a pound of sausage and a pound of veg makes enough for an army! The cup of Marsala, sweet red peppers, softened onions, 2 T tomato paste and can of diced tomatoes make this dish sweeter than your average Italian dessert.  This is an oversize-portion, fat-American recipe. I can't imagine Aunt Raffy eating this stuff, much less cooking it 
 I admit that I am not qualified to "judge" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO "stupid." I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.  This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has "got it" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.   FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.  Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.  If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.   I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck 
 This offensively simple-minded pamphlet of useless advice is only given out by managers about to lay-off as many people as they can.   Then, to take away from horrors of losing your job, you're meant to feel happy because "change is good".   Not only that... you're meant to believe that questioning change is for losers -- as if change just comes magically from above, and not as a result of corporate incompetence and greed at the highest levels.    If your boss gives you this book (or worse, makes you buy it yourself), I recommend getting "who cut the cheese" by Mason Brown, instead.  And also, remember to steal as many office supplies as you can 
 Wow, people can cite passages on the soundtrack heard before in films 20 years ago, as evidence of Horner 'recycling'.  I cant do that.  I just know that he and a handful of others write the most hackneyed scores around, making all films converge towards the mean, become homogenized.  How about something original here, like the music adding to the film by providing counterpoint, displaying complexity of emotion?    There are many examples of this, but usually not by composition but by incorporating world music or songs known already from pop music.  The fact is, Hollywood composers are a cabal, and ingenuity is not valued.    The movie was so so, I was given this soundtrack as a radio station promo.  ...another culprit is Danny Elfman, uniformly quirky, but thats another story.. 
 The other reviews give you the flavor of this book so I will bring up a few items they and the author ignore.   First, it is a vivid illustration of the more general problem in the world of what constitutes "help".  If what one does causes more misery in the long run then it is clearly not helpful and this is what nearly all of the "aid" to the third world does.  Anything that prolongs lifespans, increases child survival or increases standard of living is eventually disastrous as prosperity is ultimately bought at the expense of the future.  The whole world is going down the drain but Africa is the worst case and likely by mid-century, and certainly by it's end, there will be starvation, disease, social violence and war on a staggering scale and as a permanent state.  The world has only one problem--too many people--and only one solution--decrease the population at any cost.  Of course it's not politically correct to say anything about it and certainly not to do anything really effective and Dettwyler is in a delicate position.   These people seem to average a dozen pregnancies and above all they need birth control.  Regarding her personal choices she tells how her young daughter almost died of malaria and it clearly was quite insane of her to take a young child with her for several years of constant exposure to this and other diseases when she knew that people died of it constantly in spite of medication.  The last point that I could not forget was the fact that she produced three children of her own.  If she does not know the dire situation the world is in due to overpopulation she ought to go back to school.  Like virtually all parents, she is not a responsible member of society.   
 I had to return this.  The poetry in the book was very nice, but the pictures were too abstract I think for a preschooler to grasp, and not particularly compelling for me as an adult who not only uses preschool nature books professionally but also collects them as a hobby.  
 Genetic engineering was not possible before "we knew about genes".  The public often confuses genetic engineering with selective breeding, but the author of this type of book has no excuse for doing so.  Selective breeding works exactly the same way as natural selection (aka "survival of the fittest"), with humans providing the selection pressure (deciding which animal or plant is "fittest" - and gets to reproduce).  Genetic engineering involves combining genetic material on the molecular level - allowing combinations that would otherwise be impossible.  Genes from fish being spliced into tomato plants to create a more freeze resistant tomato is one example.  Not incidentally, domestic cats (felis catus) originated from species that are about the same size as domestic cats (felis sylvesterus - the European wildcat, and the North African subspecies).  No "shrinking" was involved.  It is interesting to note that the effects of selective breeding as practiced by humans "before we knew about genes" is not always as lasting as we might think.  For instance, myriad pigeon and poultry breeds exibit an amazing array of variety in color, feathering, and build, (an internet search will provide examples).  However, if allowed to breed amongst themselves with no human selection, the offspring will resemble the original "wild" species within a very few generations.   
 This movie is somewhat difficult to rate in my opinion because there are some good things about "Clownhouse" and some bad things about it.  The movie starts out with a young boy named Casey who is for somereason very afraid of clowns...he wets his bed when he has nightmares about them.  It appears the boy is about 11 years old and he has two brothers named Geoffery and Randy, probably 13 and 16 respectively.  Geoffery is sympathetic towards Casey while Randy is a total jerk and seems determined to torment them both.  Well, a carnival comes into town and Casey apprehensively goes along, but his fear of clowns is incredible.  In this movie, it turns out that his fear was well warranted.  At first, I thought this movie was going to be another "The Funhouse" but it was not.  That being said, "The Funhouse" is superior in every way to "Clownhouse".    As "Clownhouse" moves along, the viewer notices three individuals who appear to be quite malevolent in nature.  Indeed, these three men kill three clowns and dress up in their clown costumes.  The killing scenes were below average and not very effective at all.  What takes place afterwards is a long and sometimes boring chase scene where the clowns follow Casey back to his home.  The chase scenes are quite ridiculous to be honest with you...there is no way that Casey could have outrun these grown men and there is also no way that Casey would not have heard them running behind him.  Ultimately, the scenes move to Casey's house where the horror in this film really takes place.    Frankly, the clowns did not appear to be that scary to me at all...in fact, at times, they looked stupid!.  When one considers the great horror movie villains of the past, the clowns looked pretty weak as far as horror movie villains are concerned, and as a result, these clowns were not very effective in creating horror in and of themselves; but, that being said, Salva does a good job of putting the clowns in position in the house unbeknownst to the boys and that is where this movie is effective as horror movie and becomes quite creepy.  However, this is not enough to put this movie over the hump as a really good horror movie.  I thought the moving around and the boys' lack of knowledge of the clowns in the two story house was quite effective and at times, the movie was quite chilling in this respect, but this is really all the movie has to offer.   Once the clowns were discovered however, the movie declined in the level of horror that it had created and this is a sign of an inferior horror movie in my opinion with respect to the classics at least.  Moreover, I thought the times when the clowns actually engaged the young boys in combat were pretty lame...the three men would have easily killed these boys, but I suppose it wouldn't work if that happened, but I think that the movie would have been more effective and credible if the three boys in this movie were older...say, 17, 18 and 19.  Then, one as a viewer, might be willing to "buy" how the young boys disposed of the clowns.    Another flaw of the movie is the acting in this movie is clearly below average and there is little character development except for Casey.  The characters did not provide the movie with enough of a foundation by which the viewer can actually appreciate the movie as a whole and not just based on it's horror values...in other words, the movie just wasn't very well done or directed as a whole.  Indeed, I did not think that the choice of three brothers was very effective as far as characters are concerned, especially being as young as they were.  I thought it was a little much trying to mesh the personalities of the three brothers into such a short movie.  But, like I said, it is hard to rate "Clownhouse" as there really are some chilling moments when the clowns enter the house unbeknownst to the young boys, but that being said, this movie is not without major flaws and all and all, I can only reluctantly endorse this movie as a horror movie worth renting,but cannot really suggest that this movie is worth owning.  2.35 STARS for this flick which in my grading system is about average.  I hope this review is helpful for you in determining the pros and cons of this movie while also explaining the plot without giving away too much of the movie.  
 Sheer new age nonsense. Don't waste your time. I could pull quotes out of it all day long that would make you laugh out loud, and I'm talking about quotes where Jackson is dead serious. If he is what passes for an intellectual in the NBA, then the NBA is in trouble 
 After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume.   Hobb appears to have burnt out.  He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante.  I finished the book but it  was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru.      
 This album is terrible.  As a Mississippian, I know David Banner did a poor job of displaying the quality of music in Mississippi.  Besides the singles that were released, this cd has absolutely nothing to offer.  I commend him for trying to put Mississippi on his back, but if he's going to represent on meaningless (how many different times can you refer to your genitalia on one cd?) and useless (even though it's a southern cd, the beats aren't even that good) albums like this, I'd rather he left "The Sip" out of it 
 i really do not know why mallory wanted to join a club with that pack of nerds. who's with me??? they are, right? maybe she had nothing better to do with her time, i guess, besides writing and watching after her snot-nosed sibs. oh well. the book is completely stupid, by the way. but read it anyway. it's a bsc staple 
 My father used Dobson's methodology as a license to strike.  If you wish to die alone in a nursing home, I suggest you listen to those who worship hate and violence.  There is not a day that I don't dream of lashing my old man with a studded belt to punish him in return, and am contemplating not having children to let the cycle of violence end with me.  God bless America, we really need it... 
 If you would like this item to actually arrive then get it somewhere else. I've been waiting since late January 
 Disney is a joke and this movie is a joke.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  Why does Disney keep instisting on taking these dark, disturbing tales, such as Pocahontas, Alladin and the Huntchback of Notre Dame (which, by the way is really Notre Dame of Paris) and making them into cutsey kids films?  And, oh, lets give it a happy wappy, cutesy wutesy ending.  Screw that; this is a dark, sad and disturbing tale AND THAT'S THE WAY THIS STORY SHOULD BE!  What the heck story is Disney going to try to adapt as a children's film next?  The Scarlet Letter?  
 I order the book and I started to read it as soon as I got it out of the box.  I also ordered the Webster"s secretarial handbook.  This book was a lot better and had useful information.  The Valuable office  professional  was a bit confusing to read.  The information was very  pointless

 The author slips over this line once too often to rate the book above 2 stars - and that's in a fairly slim book (just under 200 pages).  The forward by backward by forward tale of this couple's ultimate day alive - the details of a past that had them returning to this spot - the nature of animals being their passion and study - and their passion as animals being the authors study - how time moves on and through all of us without paying much notice to us.  However, the author spends a great deal of time examining their lives which really are practically unfulfilled and fairly dull lives to begin with - in deep scientific detail.  What they had for breakfast, what clothes they wore, how much and how little they actually feel for one another at various moments throughout the day -   But no one ever really wakes up or comes to life - so it comes to matter very little - even to their daughter - whether the couple is alive or dead 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 This is the same old liberal tripe repackaged into another paranoid "I Hate George W. Bush" tome.  Can't the left come up with anything better than this garbage?  Here's a summary of every one of these absurd books, including Hightower's:  George W. Bush is evil; George W. Bush is unintelligent; George W. Bush lied; George W. Bush stole the 2000 election; George W. Bush started the Iraq War to benefit Haliburton; George W. Bush lets corporations run the country...blah blah blah. It's the same tired crap with a different cover.    Don't waste your money 
 Did not work right out of the box. The heating elements did not get hot. So I had to return it otherwise I would be throwing money away.  Do not buy 
 It sounds like many of you have children who have ADD and you chose not to go the medication route.  Be careful - and don't forget it is your child not you who has to  live with this - and you should not judge the success of any plan on "if you think he is behaving better" but rather on his/her happiness.  This is not about you - it is about your child.  I think any child who changes his diet will manifest different behaviors.  But ADD is a genetic, neurological disorder - to use the word "onset" and "prevention" of ADD - this is the most demeaning and blaitantly wrong term I have ever heard.  Attention Deficit Disorder is caused by an insufficient release and absorbtion of Dopamine.  Can a diet affect this - maybe a little - but concerta, ritalin, etc - actually do affect the release of dopamine.  I applaud all of you in your research of ADD but be skeptical  - of medication and of "Diets".  What I do know is that I attend middlebury college and for the first three semesters I was getting mostly B's some A-'s (all without medication) - then convinced I was trying too hard or atleast much harder than everyone else for the same outcome, I decided to try concerta - which I refused in my earlier childhood years (seven-ten) as most kids do.  I took an extra class and I pulled off 4A-s and a B+.  I would like to think it was all me - and it really was all me, but the hard thing to understand is that many kids with ADD are intelligent enough - instead it is the neurology.  Don't sell your child short by staking yourself as an anti-pharmaceutical parent...The doctors (experts) prescribe it for a reason.  Keep your child playing  sports, give him structure, have compassion and that is half the battle. 
 This is the kind of translation exercise you get in this book. Other reviewers have commented on the stilted language and subject matter, both in English and Arabic. How about, "I have seen many spiders. The beys' and pashas' rooms must be swept afresh," or "Follow the well-known plan and put the olives in the barrels."  These are not sentences from 1965, the date of the first edition, but from the British mandate.    If you want to learn Arabic, you need to use a text book, not a grammar book. There are lots of good ones available, and there are lots of grammar books available with more authentic examples 
 "Internal Combustion" by Edwin Black is an entertaining but uneven history about the control of energy with a purported emphasis on the ascendancy of the gasoline-powered automobile. To his credit, Mr. Black has managed a substantive research project that has uncovered a great deal of arcane historic information about the automotive industry. Unfortunately, this preachy book suffers from an acute lack of focus, where it is suspected that the large amounts of extraneous background material was added in an attempt to obscure the book's shortcomings. Indeed, the author ultimately fails to prove his central thesis, thereby casting doubt about the validity of both his research and his conclusions.  Mr. Black opens the book with a scene depicting the burning of Thomas Edison's research laboratories in December, 1914. Mr. Black's conspiracy theory proposes that sinister forces aligned with the gasoline-burning automotive industry may have intentionally destroyed the world's one and only hope to mass-produce an electric car. Unfortunately, Mr. Black provides no evidence to prove this allegation.    Mr. Black attempts to buttress his case by explaining that electric vehicles were once utilized as taxis in New York and other major cities in the late nineteenth century and, therefore, could have and should have been mass marketed to an appreciative public. We are supposed to accept Mr. Black's thesis that success would have been an inevitable and logical outcome despite the severe weight, cost and range limitations of the electric car when compared with the gasoline automobile. In fact, while Thomas Edison and Henry Ford were still tinkering with an electric alternative a full thirteen years after gasoline-powered vehicles had already been in mass production, it is evident to the reader that internal combustion vehicles prevailed because they were affordable, the first to market and could traverse longer distances than electric cars. That all of this was not a good development for people's health and the environment is not in dispute; rather, it is Mr. Black's contention that the white-hatted purveyors of electric vehicles could have prevailed save for the obstructionism of the black-hatted petroleum industry that remains in question.    In the end, what is conspicuously lacking throughout the book is a credible attempt at analyzing and critiquing the history of governmental and popular struggle with the fossil-fuel industry. But instead of scholarship, we have a vainglorious author who is determined to salvage the barren results of two years' worth of study by substituting analysis with a highly questionable work of narrative. The end result is little more than a masquerade of nonfiction; at best, it is a book that might have limited appeal to readers who crave pseudo-historicism at the expense of intellectual rigor, consistency, insight or coherence. 
 The topic of this book certainly sounded interesting, especially since I was taking a Media Laws course at the time I read it.  However, this book was bogged down with too many problems for me to recommend it.  First of all, the book is full of small errors that make it seem like it was hastily thrown together and shoved onto the shelves.  The author is listed as "Bob Levin" on the front cover, but as "Bob Levine" on the spine.  A citation on the back page quotes an editor as calling the book "The definitive history of this wonderful, mad (and, I believe, signficant) episode in Amercan [sic] popular culture."  And one of the illustrations and comics in the book are listed as being from 1971, even though Levin later says (correctly) that they were from the mid 90s.  Aside from these annoying but ultimately forgivable problems, the author just doesn't have a very fluid or gripping writing style.  Some of his sentences so grossly overuse punctuation marks that they may discuss three different topics in a single sentence.  I will admit that he does a passable job describing copyright laws, but that was just one part of this book.  His footnotes also tend to be places for him to get in his two cents rather than truly informative additions.  And he ultimately fails to make the characters endearing to the audience, which is frustrating since he admits in the book that each author is trying to sell a story or viewpoint to the reader.  It may be more objective to paint the Air Pirates as nothing more than a bunch of stoned twenty-somethings following an even more-stoned thirty-something, but it sure didn't sell to me that we should be rooting for them.  The ending of the book also let me down.  I won't go into details, but suffice it to say that after discussing a series of lawsuits brought against the Air Pirates, the story ends very abruptly, without describing the final decision in any great detail.  This should have been the climax of the narrative, and it just fizzles out.  So while I appreciate Bob Levin pointing out this interesting case that has apparently gotten very little recognition, I wish that he would have discovered it, and then turned it over to a better author 
 Stultifyingly written. No one without at least an undergraduate major in philosophy will get much out of it. I recommend that all tempted to read this should first read the Kirkham book "Theories of Truth" 
 I can't really add anything to what is said in the other reviews.  This is a terrible product.  It sticks to everything - hands, tables, rugs, dogs, everything.  Disgusting.  I only wish I had read these reviews before I let my kids put it on their Christmas lists 
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 We bought this because we wanted to be able to send a 10+ page fax well.  It constantly pulls more than one page if you have under 5 pages...this results in you haveing to hold each page separate until the one before it gets sucked up.  The most annoying thing is that it doesn't hold much paper and is constantly running out if you don't frequently check it.  AND! once the paper runs out, We have a hard time getting a new stack of paper to load.  I keeps saying load paper, and you jiggle the stack around and it rotates the roller but never sucks up a new piece and keeps showing "Load Paper"  I will fiddle with it for about twenty min. before it grabs the first page and works properly.  Needless to say I am searching for a new machine and when I find one I am throwing this the L80 into the lake at the next "Load Paper" 
 This book was okay, but it was a bit confusing. The plot was good but I think it could have been written better. It was a little weird, and it just wasn't a great book, in my opinion. I wouldn't highly recommend it, but go  ahead and read it if you want to 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 If you already have a spool knitter and lots of "snakes" on hand you will be disappointed.  There are not a lot of projects, especially for the smaller snakes.  Too much of the book is devoted to making spool knitters 
 Some of the twelve-step groups are absurd. There are groups for an amazing number of "spiritual diseases". Just the short list of the common ones includes:  AA Alcoholics Anonymous  Abusive Parents Anonymous  ACOA Adult Children Of Alcoholics  ADD Anonymous  Al-Anon  Alateen  Alcoholics Victorious of the Institute for Christian Living  ARTS Anonymous (Artists Recovering through the Twelve Steps)  Augustine Fellowship: Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous  CA Cocaine/Crack Anonymous  Calix (a Catholic 12-Step-based recovery organization)  CDA Chemically Dependent Anonymous  CEA Compulsive Eaters Anonymous  CMA Crystal Meth Anonymous  Chronic Illness  CLA Clutterers Anonymous  CODA Codependents Anonymous  COSA Codependents of Sex Addicts  Compulsive Eaters Anonymous  Compulsive Shopping  Debtors Anonymous  Diabetics Anonymous  Divorce Recovery  Dual Diagnosis Anonymous  Drug-Anon Focus  Dual Disorders Anonymous  DRA Dual Recovery Anonymous  EAA Eating addictions anonymous  EA Emotions Anonymous  EDA Eating Disorders Anonymous  EAA Eating Addictions Anonymous  Emotional Health Anonymous  Ethics Anonymous  FA Families Anonymous  FA Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous  GA Gamblers Anonymous  GamAnon -- families of gamblers  Gangs Anonymous  HCVA Hepatitis C Virus Anonymous  High blood pressure  ISA Incest Survivors Anonymous  Marijuana Anonymous  Methadone Anonymous  MTC Make Today Count (for someone with a terminal disease)  NA Narcotics Anonymous  Nar-Anon - families of addicts  Nick-a-teen Anonymous  Nicotine Anonymous  Obsessive-Compulsive Anonymous  Offenders Anonymous -- for convicts  ODAT One Day At a Time -- pagan recovery  Overcomers Outreach  OE Overeaters Anonymous  PIR Pagans In Recovery  Pagan Sanctum Recovery  Parents Anonymous  Pill Addicts Anonymous  Pills Anonymous  Prostitutes Anonymous  Recovering Couples Anonymous  RSA Rape Survivors Anonymous  S/A Schizophrenics Anonymous  S/A Schizophrenics Anonymous  SA Sexaholics Anonymous  SAA Sex Addicts Anonymous  SAA Sex Addicts Anonymous (alternate URL)  S-Anon - family groups of sex-addicts  SCA Sexual Compulsives Anonymous  S-Anon International Family Groups  SLAA Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous  Sexual Recovery Anonymous  SIA Survivors of Incest Anonymous  Partners and Friends of Incest Survivors Anonymous  Tough Love  WA Workaholics Anonymous  Some of these groups offer their own minor variations on the twelve steps, but all have the same spiritual-religious orientation.            Notice the funny mix of so-called "spiritual diseases" there: you can "cure" some of them just by changing your behavior, like alcoholism, narcotics, smoking, over-eating, sex addiction, gambling, cocaine, or being a compulsive shopper or a clutterer. But the others are not what we might call "voluntary" diseases. You cannot just voluntarily quit having high blood pressure, diabetes, hepatitis C, chronic illness, dual disorder (i.e.: having both mental and drug or alcohol problems) or schizophrenia, so I really want to hear how listing and confessing all of your sins, "moral shortcomings", and "defects of character" will cure those diseases.   Someone would have to be pretty crazy to think that doing the Twelve Steps -- performing a searching and fearless moral inventory and confessing all of his sins -- is going to cure mental illnesses like schizophrenia and compulsive-obessive disorders.   But, come to think of it, that's just how the game works, isn't it? Go find sick, vulnerable people who are suffering, whose minds aren't too clear, and exploit their weaknesses and talk them into joining a cult religion while telling them that this magical 12-Step program will heal what ails them.    Dumb Question: Why are there three "Dual" recovery groups that appear to treat the same mental problems -- Dual Diagnosis, Dual Disorder, and Dual Recovery?  Dumb Answer: So that the people who have Multiple Personality Disorder4 can send each of their personalities to a different group, so that they don't run into each other at the meetings...      Another dumb question: Why do schizophrenics need 12-Step groups telling them to do Step Eleven, and pray and meditate until they hear God talking to them, when those schizophrenics already hear God and sundry other voices in their heads talking to them all day long anyway?     If Workaholics Anonymous people do 90 meetings in 90 days, are they still being compulsive workaholics?  Shouldn't 180 meetings in 90 days fix the problem?      Last night I joined Gamblers Anonymous. They gave me two to one I don't make it. == Rodney Dangerfield    And the oddest ones have to be "divorce recovery 
 I met the author and loved him. He has a great personality and positive spirit. I heard him tell a portion of his life story and was touched that he turned out to be such a positive human being.  Then I read the book and the air was fully let out of my little balloon. This book is awful. The story itself is awful.  There's nothing good I can say about it and I'm shocked at all of the reviews that are singing this book's praises.  If we were rating the author, I'd give him a five.  I'd give him a ten if I could.  But giving the book such a rating would be lying. I felt like Jihad tried so hard to make it "urban" that he lost sight of telling a good story and just focused on a bunch of senseless violence, sex and cussing. I'm disappointed but the author is so likable that I'd give another of his books another chance.  I hear his first one is much better, so I plan to read that one soon 
 what i enjoy tremendously about the sister fidelma series is the exploration of the people and culture of ireland.  this entry in the series falls woefully short.  yes, i know it is set in wales, but all the cultural/societal interactions are missing.  this was a mystery set in a 2 dimensional world.  i expect better from sister fidelma 
 I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years.  Pros: I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient.  The cons: Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months. 
 I HATE THE ROLLING STONES. THEY WERE ONE OF THE WORST BANDS IN HISTORY!! THIS IN MY OPINION IS THEIR ONLY GOOD ALBUM. THIS HAS SOME OF THE GREATEST SONGS FEATURING SHATTERED. GET THIS WITH ALBUMS FROM DIRE STRAITS, GNR, FOREIGNER, AND METALLICA BUT STAY FAR AWAY FROM THE A BIGGER BANG, BEGGARS BANQUET, STICKY FINGERS, AND EXILE ON MAIN STREET ALBUMS WHICH SUCK BIG PERIOD 
 I know you're excited, and you want everything to be perfect and planned down to the tiniest detail, and you're working on [probably] the biggest budget you've ever had to work with, but PLEASE save the $__.__ and buy yourself a new 8-hour lipstick instead. Then go to the library, and oogle over how many of these ridiculous CDs they have for you to listen to for free. Trust me, once you decide on your songs, you'll never listen to the CD again 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 Is Larry an actual redneck, or is it all really a joke inside "Larry's" mind?  I sometimes think that Dan Whitney (Larry's real name) knows what he's doing.  I think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him.  He is openly mocking them, and when they might get a tad uncomfortable, but then he'll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine, and they love him again.  Dan/Larry started out as a "normal" comedian (there's footage of him on youtube before his Larry incarnation), and wasn't really getting anywhere with that.  So he became a redneck, and is a multi-millionare now.  But all his redneck fans think of Larry as a "regular guy", despite the fact that Larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only NYCers live in (for the record, NYCers don't all live in fancy houses.  There's a lot of working class people in NYC who live in regular houses and regular apartments).  So Larry is taking advantage of illiterate, easily amused rednecks.  Just put on a flannel shirt, fart, wear a Confederate flag, and say you hate liberals, then fleece the rednecks!  I don't think Larry really has a redneck mentality (even though he's originally from Nebraska, so he has some hillbilly cred, so to speak).  I think he's just making a ton of money off of easily amused people.      
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 Tiresome, repetitive sexual descriptions, no character development, unexplained events, no plot, very little humor.  Ten years ago, Hamilton was doing interesting work, exploring some moral issues, having some character development, and humor.  Now both the Blake and Gentry series are predicable and sex obsessed 
 There is nothing insightful about this book. If men didn't START wars,they wouldn't have to die in them. Men have NOT been the only ones to make great art, music & scientific discoveries. Try the fact that for most of mankind's history, women were not permitted to be professionals in these areas, and until very recently, on an historical scale, were denied the schooling necessary to make "great scientific discoveries." And if we're going to whine about things like men working in coal mines, then let's not forget all the women who have been forced into prostitution or who died in childbirth, (and sometimes still do.)    And I don't know what women you people know, but surprise guys - many of us don't actually live to shop. And, in fact, most of the women I know handle the responsibilty for juggling the household bills, and their husbands are CLUELESS about how to do that and make ends meet. Some of us even have interests we prefer to explore. Imagine that.   Life isn't fair - grow up and get over yourselves. And nobody "forces" you to do anything. If you don't want adult responsibilites- than don't accept them. It's your choice. Don't get married, don't have children, and live your lives any way you like. But for God's sake, stop your crying. It's pitiful. 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 I found out that there isn't any difference with Adkins for Life from the first book.  Disappointing,  I tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results.  However, I never support anything unless I have been convinced it truly does what it says and I found that with "the average joes diet."  A friend told me about it and I was always considered the fat girl.  No longer! and it's stayed off. 
 The science is: brains are like neural nets; a hidden layer with feedback gives nets the ability to detect temporal patterns; information/logic in a net is distributed.  That's it, plus some rambling about Husserl that seems largely irrelevant (if you're curious it's summarised pretty well by the review above (by the "top 100 reviewer" who apparently never gives below 4 stars...))  So if you're at all interested in consciousness, you probably know the science.  If you don't, then I assume you've read a bit more than the typical science nerd and expect a basic level of narrative competence - you're going to be disappointed.  The fiction part is embarassingly bad.  The plotting is appalling; the characterisation cartoon-like.  Some reviewers are saying this would be good for an introductory course.  It would have to be very introductory.  (I see that this book is currently being offered with Papadimitriou's "Turing".  That's not a great book, either, but it's stunningly good compared to this - it has warmth, wit and depth.  The closest this book gets is a painful irony; the cover suggest that someone, somewhere, was hoping for a noir ambience, but the only darkness comes from a power cut).  I feel bad writing a negative review, because I guess this was a work of love.  I can understand the desire to popularise ideas that you find interesting.  But please, if you're going to take my money, give me something at least half-way decent.  If I were the author I'd be pretty mad with the editors at MIT for letting me publish something this bad.  And finally, I note that one star is the lowest rating possible, which is rather sneaky of Amazon (doesn't their use of the arithmetic mean imply a zero-based scale?).  [Later - for a stunning treatment of similar material see Power's Galatea 2.2 
 This album is, as has been mentioned before, a followup to Rice's O -- which in my estimation was an amazing CD that warranted listening to over and over again, adding to ipod playlists, creating CD's for my wife and just generally enjoying. Creative lyrics, although sometimes inscrutable (Blower's Daughter, one of my favorite songs, but what the heck is he talking about?!), made O never get old.  9 really misses the mark. It sounds like Damien has gone through some relationship issues that are still quite raw (affair, lack of passion, confusion, bitterness?) and although this sometimes makes for very interesting music in this case it is just too far inside the angst of Damien for me to relate to. Witness a sample of lyrics from the song 'Rootless Tree':  So **** you, **** you, **** you And all you didn't do I said leave it, leave it, leave it It's nothing to you And do you hate me, hate me, hate me, hate me so much That you can't let me out, let me out, let me out Of hell when you're around Let me out, let me out, let me out Hell when you're around Let me out, let me out, let me out  Ok then. Then there is 'Me, My Yoke and I':  My fall, my fall My fall gonna break ya My fall, my fall My fall gonna break your wall  I'm in, I'm in, I'm in Like a big dog I'm in, I'm in, I'm in Like a big dog yeah My god, my god, my god Gave me a rod My god, my god, my god Gave me a rod  For fishin, fishin, fishin Fishin, fishin, fishin yeah  Starting to get the idea? This is a self absorbed (more than usual) album that an angst filled "alone in my teenage bedroom" songwriter has written before but had the sense to not share with the world. Oh, and 'Sleep Don't Weep' ends with like 15 minutes of a Tibetan Bowl -- an annoying tone played continuously until it bores into your very skull. Was Rice just trying to see how much his listener's would put up with?  Having said all that, Lisa Hannigan shines once more in '9 Crimes' and Damien complements her very well, and you may find one or two more to strike your fancy, but overall I must say that the "emperor has no clothes" , even if others are afraid to say it 
 I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist 
 This was a major disappointment.  I am a great fan of any "Vatican"  novel and will read some mediocre stuff to get my fix.  This, however, did not reach that standard!  It is the first novel I have been tempted to give up when only half-way through.  As for the suggestion that a bunch of feminist-minded nuns are trying to change the church, this compliments the book too much.  There is a dream story that keeps appearing throughout the story but adds nothing.  Page after page of some medieval drivel.  Comparisons to Morris West  -  kidding?  You might say I didn't like this one 
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 Being a fledgling opponent of strong AI, I picked up this book hoping to learn the weaknesses of the strong AI argument. Alas, this was the wrong book to pick up.  I am not even sure what Penrose's main argument is; of course it may be there but was lost in the 450 pages of mostly irrelevant details on physics. To say in the least, his attack is not coherent or well structured. He seems to admit that his position is very vulnerable himself: he constantly admits to mere speculation and weakness of evidence on his part.   If he abridged this book to may 100 or 200 pages, it may have been more effective. When I was half way through, I nearly quit reading because I could tell he was going nowhere, but I figured if I had already wasted this much time, I might was well finish it. I regret that decision now.   TENM may be just another example of a grandiose physicist touting an interesting subject like modern physics as accessible to the layman. If it is accessible, Penrose is not the one to do it. There seems to be a market for these pop physics books (i.e. Elegant Universe) because yuppies out there want a feeling of wonderment about things they don't understand. How much they actually get from these  books questionable.   In the end, Penrose somehow wants to say that modern physics presents an obstacle for strong AI. I hope there are books out there that actually might show this 
 I have traveled to China and am fascinated by the country.  I looked forward to this book and as I started to read it, the bginning fulfilled all my ideas of the early twentieth century in China,  tidbits about living there and the white russians.  I eagerly read and then realized that the book had lost it's potential.  I am sorry that the author's two brothers had lost their way and even more sorry that his oldest brother committed suicide but I lost all desire to read the book. It is almost like he is still coming to terms with the death.  ANytime some relative does something that drastic, it is traumatizing but after a while it became less about China and more about life outside China.  Of course that is where I stopped reading so I didn't know if he got back on course.  Still I would have hoped that the actual life in China as a child would be more interesting.  What about his sister and what it was like for a girl born in the 1920's in China?  It seems Frank was the only one who mattered and the suthor's sister is bearly a footnote.   Did the family learn Chinese or not?  Did they live in an isoltaed european word or did they take in the chinese atmosphere, description of housing, clothing, a read feell for China would have been a better read than all the non-chinese section 
 "The Day the World Went Away" was the leadoff single from "The Fragile" and is of minimal value to all but collectors.  Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from "The Fragile" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the "We're In This Together" singles.  But looking at the songs themselves-- "The Day The World Went Away" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  "Starf***ers, Inc" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.  Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I thought this book was a stiff and hard to read I don`t this is a good read for a parent 
 This is not so much an encyclopedia as it is an encyclopedic religious polemic.  Its "Topical Index"  contains an entry on almost every Christian sect in America from the Quakers to the Romans, but not a single reference to any branch of Judaism, (or any other non-Christian faith for that matter). However, atheism, paganism and cannibalism DO get their own entries! Go figure.    There are few quotes in here from non-Christians. No Jewish Supreme Court Justices, or Jewish statesmen or Jewish military leaders are quoted, but  Conrad Hilton, a Christian hotel manager and playboy gets half a page. Non-Christians like Albert Einstein  only get a couple of short,  out-of-context blurbs.   If you agree with folks at Amerisearch, the publishers of "America's God and Country" and believe that the Founding Fathers were just joking around about the First Amendment. then you will have no problem with this book.  But if you need a more inclusive  reference work on the religious, and philosophical fabric of the United States, move on, this one has tunnelvision. It is very biased, to the point of creepy, with gaping omissions and therefore too compromised to be useful as a legitimate reference. Perhaps in the next edition they'll have a nice quote from Paris Hilton 
 The author reveals himself and not the topic.  The American revolution was complex like all human dramas.  Historians give meaning when they bring to the surface the facts and attempt to place them both within the context of that time and within a philosophy.  The author certainly brings his philosophy to the endeavor, but he utterly fails to provide the context of the times.  In the end, he might as well have written something about modern times, as it would be equally revealing 
 I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005.  I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker.  Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long.  Only load was computer, monitor, and router).  At any rate, the shut down was successful.  But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so. Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here 
 Totally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher 
 This percolator would be great except the lid was too tight and extremely difficult to remove. After only about a week the gasket around the glass window in the top cracked from having to pull the handle so hard to get the lid off, and coffee leaked out through the break as it perked. I called customer service and they said they'd replace the lid but it is on backorder...I have been waiting for over two months now. I don't know how you are supposed to get the lid off without using the handle, though, so what's the point 
 Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.    
 If you have any respect for the blues legend, don't buy this, don't even rent it. The very few decent tribute performances do not make up for the lack of content in this DVD. Pointless interviews and speeches make for annoying filler, when all we really want is the music. Especially disappointing is the performance by Weir/Wasserman. They rattle off a an aimless and depthless "Walkin' Blues" You can't help but feel that Wasserman would rather be somewhere else. Most irritating is the claim that this so-called conference "found" a "very rare" film clip of the man himself. It is presented to a lecture-hall audience, to which Robert Johnson's son was a part. When asked by the speaker if the man playing guitar was indeed Robert Johnson, he said clearly:"No." "Ummm...are you sure?"  "YES!" "Oh...well, so it may not be him, but is certainly LOOKS like him..." Why was this even included here? If it's NOT footage of Robert Johnson, then why didn't it wind up on the cutting room floor? Bleah 
 I found this movie to be quite bad: Montgomery Clift didn't act, he simply frowned throughout, showing barely any other emotion. The dialogue was trite, the suspense contrived, many of the scenes irrelevant, some of the action, especially the climax, unbelievable, and much of the direction obviously self-conscious and manipulative. The actors sounded like they were reading script lines and not speaking and moving the way human beings would in many of the story's situations.   Even the principle of religious confession in this story seemed hollow because the killer showed neither repentence nor a willingness to reform--which made him a continued menace to society. Is a priest supposed to shield such a murderer from prosecution on the grounds of "client privilege" while the rest of society remains vulnerable to the killer's next possible murder? What kind of religion is this? The priest didn't even preach to him about the evil of killing and the necessity of accepting punishment for such irresponsible behavior, as a means of reformation and of ultimately becoming worthy of God's forgiveness, grace and the eternal kingdom.   This principle of penance was beautifully exemplified in the movie "The Mission," as Robert DeNiro, playing the part of a mercinary killer, realized the error of his ways and painfully performed penance for his killings ; he not only accepted responsibility for his actions, considering them terribly wrong, but showed a determination to never repeat them; he himself then became a good priest and helped jungle natives live a better, more useful life. This character was worthy of forgiveness and absolution--a far cry from what the O.E. Hasse murderer displays in "I confess". Any priest who defends an unrepentent murderer from justice becomes as guilty of the murder as the murderer--even worse--because he risks the lives of other members of society. He in fact becomes a co-conspirator!  And the killer, in the last scene, murdering his wife in broad daylight--to silence her from revealing his crime--while police officers are standing all around him? What would that accomplish? He would undoubtedly get convicted of this crime and either receive a sentence of life in prison or the death penalty.   C'mon, give me a break! My name isn't Bozo 
 This product is far by the worst CD player I've ever owned. It's takes a while for the songs to read on the CD and the songs will randomly stop while the eye tries to read the disc. At first I thought it was just my CD, but I changed it through 8 CD's and the same thing happened. The anti-skip is also terrible like stated above. I wouldn't recommend this cancerous CD player to anyone. The headphones are also VERY uncomfortable. Please don't waste your money 
 We need a one-volume history of European Integration, but not this five hundred page panegyric to...Margaret Thatcher?  In Gillingham's funhouse, Thatcher is the key figure in European Integration, receiving more attention than any of the individuals who actually tried to integrate Europe, most of whom are dismissed, often in very personal terms.  European integration indeed disappears from the book sometimes for sixty pages at a time while the author reviews political developments of right-wing governments in...New Zealand?  A very distorted understanding of European integration 
 I feel that this was below par performance for both Winona Ryder and Dennis Quaid. It just didn't gel too much as I felt as though there was too much embelishing on certain points of the movie to where the second half of the movie seemed to rush through too fast, and with too many photographs. The Jerry Lee Lewis story is a interesting one indeed since I found out he is related to Jimmy Swaggart. I often wondered how Jerry Lee reacted when Jimmy fell in 1988? I often look around at bumper stickers at cars that say If God Doesn't Exist Then Act As Though He Doesn't, and I often wonder for those who feel Christians are judgemental if a Christian falls down what is thier reaction. I admit when both Bakker and Swaggart fell I was harsh with them, and I guess I felt it was my right because it gave me creedence to the way I lived my lifestyle. Do all others feel the same way? I felt that there was also too much explaining of the inspiration of doing the song "Whole Lot Of Shakin Goin On". That is my favorite Lewis song, and then they take it to a honky tonk in Tennessee, and the women were drunk, and these were the more mature looking women, and that was a turn off for me as I just can't handle drunk people. I just found alot of things that just didn't gel with this, and June 12th, 1994 was the last time I watched this movie, and I never will again so help me God. 
 Being influenced by this book at an early age robbed me of being distinctly feminine.  Boys and girls are different and to deny that is ignorant 
 I decided to try the Covington books because they were supposed to be in the same vein as Jan Karon's Mitford and Ann B. Ross' Miss Julia books.  I am a huge Mitford fan, with the Miss Julia books being some of my next favorites.  The Covington books have a good potential story line, but the characters are very two dimensional and spend lots of time discussing trivial things.  I found the dialogue to bounce around a bit, and some of the character's thoughts and actions seem to come out of nowhere, without sufficient background or detail being laid.  Frankly, I also missed having some humor in the story line, though there are ample places that it could have been incorporated.  I guess this is consistent with the "flat" feeling I had about these books. 
 Unfortunately, this book is the sign of what passes for humour these days. Even though it may have been remotely funny (sometimes the author comes close to being bearable), the book never actually tries to be.   Humour is supposed to be smart. However, this book gives us the worst case of dumb 
 Disappointingly, this book covers tired old terrain -- treat the Chinese with "respect", take a long-term view, etc.  The history and culture are covered better in "New Asian Emperors" as is the strategic decision-making; the business environment by "The Chinese".  For negotiating with the Chinese, I strongly recommend "Asian Mind Games" over anything in this book 
 Don't read this book if you are an admirer of horror fiction, ala Stephen King or Dean Koontz.   This is slash and smash horror, full of pat phrases and not very well written.  I guess this is horror for horror's sake, or horror for high school drop outs.  I kept reading it because I kept thinking maybe things will get better.  The plot is better than the writing, which is a shame because it could have been a really good book. 
 I'm a huge fan of regional food, and was thrilled to see a cookbook from a place where I once had a truly notable meal.  So I bought this book.  One cold Sunday morning I cracked it out to make cornbread, cornbread should be easy, right?.  Well you see, there is a trick to cutting down the huge portions restaurants make to home cook size.  One of these tricks is to TEST THE RECIPE BEFORE THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED. The proportions of wet to dry as printed make a cornbread that would rival asphalt.  Truly a shameful and lazy mistake.  Don't know who to blame the Blue Willow or the Sterns, so I'll blame them all 
 HART'S WAR had potential. The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI's crammed into an overcrowded POW compound.  If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.    Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER'S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.    In the story Colin Farrell's character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator's defense during the subsequent courts martial.    If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.  Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart's unexplained behavior, an mass tunnel escape plot, sabotage and the German Commandant's attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage.  HART'S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic, no doubt to cut costs.   A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office.  Still, if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection 
 At this juncture, I've only had opportunity to read the publisher's summary and a reader review, wherein the author's concentration on the U.S. data is majored.  But, "the sixties" were not a uniquely American  phenomenon.  Rather, virtually the whole world convulsed in the sixties  (see, e.g., South America; Europe) and these countries were free from such  influences as Viet Nam and the American style of child-rearing.  Thus, the  true root (and an informative understanding) of "the sixties"  must be sought beyond -- as well as within -- our borders 
 You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have.  Don't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it. Many changes are literally imposed on you, like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars. Missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return.  There are new features which can be helpful to some, but Microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining.   The arrogance of Microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible.  You upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual.   
 Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006)  Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks.  Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on.  Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. * 
 How a script this bad ever made it out of an introductory creative writing class is beyond me. I would love to meet the idiots who put this together. They must be rich. Terrible writing, directing, acting 
 If you like to read a story where the author is so in love with big, fancy-pants words and spinning his tires without getting anywhere then this is the book for you.  This guy has a great command of vocabulary and language and often writes beautiful sentences THAT GO NOWHERE!. To say that these stories are slow in developing would be an insult to slow.  The first story is great, I will say that, but the others meander and meander and describe and describe and finally you get a hint of true plot and action without endless description and the story is over.  The stories are overlong, overblown and self-congratulatory. Yes he is like China Melville but I actually like China and feel bad saying that. They both have a similar feel to the universe they create and they both have astounding vocabularies but China also incorporates some meat with all the potatoes. This guy had a good idea and then got lost in a thesauras 
 The Demon feature on this disc is just okay,,An occasional scare but not much plot, Lots of running around in the dark and lots of nudity,,darn little plot,,and no reason to know anything about the killer,,he is just a BIG sicko much like Halloweens mad killer..no motive just lots of killing,,DUH! I think it is supposed to be set in the USA but everyone was in cars with driver on the right hand side of car..God told me to is also okay,,a shade better perhaps than the demon,,Good Against Evil (whatever ) is a direct Rosemary's Baby rip off,,enough said, 
 Even though this is for "idiots" it was still not as idiot-proof as I was hoping.  It seems more geared for buying/acquiring/merging larger sized companies.  I was really looking for Small Business.  I purchased another book "Business Buyer's Kit" which was much easier to follow and more comprehensive 
 this is probably the most sinful of this series that promises extended play club versions but rarely follows through. Here's the track times:  1. Everybody Everybody (4:10) (7" version) 2. Back to Life (3:51) (7") 3. Finally (6:26) (edit of 12") 4. The Power (5:43) (album verion, not hit version) 5. Pump Up The Jam (3:38) (7") 6.

 My mother recently ordered this book by Mr. Chopra and was urging me to read it. She spoke very highly of it and told me that he used science to prove God and such, etc. Allow me to be upfront. I am a skeptic, and a firm Atheist. I do not believe in the backward illogical concept of God that most religion would scare you to believe in. But I decided to keep an open mind, as I always do, and I read Mr. Chopra's "How To Know God" from cover to cover.   First of all, Mr. Chopra does not speak of the God that most religions speak of. He in fact urges the reader to rethink their concept of God, the first chapter is called "A Real and Useful God". Here Mr. Chopra describes a God that all of us can reach directly, and he also describes most people's general view of God and how he is a supposedly unattainable God until death...etc. He then devises 7 Stages of God, that match our human emotions and says there is a God for each stage. He continues to say that whenever we feel this or that, we are experiencing the God of that stage. This is where I begin to have a problem.   Mr. Chopra begins this book with his own concept of God, that is neither supported by scientific evidence or any sort of rational thought at all. I was unable to get anything out of the following pages because I could not help wondering why I was not given any evidence into Mr. Chopra's thought process. He simply creates his own idea and flies with it, assuming the reader will just go along with it and not apply any sort of thought. This is weak and misleading. But I continued to read. He then begins to talk about three versions of reality, the material reality (the material world), virtual reality, and quantum reality (God's world outside of space-time). He then says that there are many arguments in the material world against God, but none of these can be applied because God is not in the material reality, he is in the Quantum reality. Absolute garbage! Pure assumption! I was outraged by this statement, and saw it as a poor way of denying the logical and rational arguments against God. Mr. Chopra once again maintains excellent continuity by not supporting his claims with any sort of scientific evidence. How can he say that God is in a different reality? What makes him think God isn't in the same reality that we are in? How does he know there is a virtual reality? These so-called "realities" seem very fabricated to me. They are a clever way of escaping arguments against God, if you put God outside of this world then you can't apply any arguments from our reality to his, according to Chopra. I do not buy this, and feel sorry for anyone who does. I am impressed though. That is a clever trick, and nothing more than a trick. Mr. Chopra seems to be exhibiting "wishful thinking" here. He acknowledges that the mind is in search of God and needs God (with scientifc evidence), I believe Chopra's mind is just like all other minds and wants to justify God and find God, so he will by all means attempt to do that. He wishes for there to be a God, and so there will be. He can change his reality as he pleases. This sort of wishful thinking is dangerous when explaning or proving a point because it makes Mr. Chopra incredibly biased and unreliable.   While reading this book in its early pages I was almost assured that Mr. Chopra was speaking of God in a purely metaphorical sense, but I later found (much to my disappointment) that he was speaking of God in a very real and literal sense. Many will claim that Chopra uses "science" and "quantum physics" to explain God and how we can reach him, but that is a misconception and perversion of the truth. Mr. Chopra does indeed make clever points using theories and stories involving quantum physics, but they do not relate directly to the existence of God, or our ability to reach him. They seem to just be random tidbits Chopra throws in so he can say he proved God and our ability to reach him with "science." It is an absolute mockery.   I did find Mr. Chopra's ending chapters on the paranormal (telepathy, esp, clairvoyance, synchronicity) to be interesting, but once again not supported by anything and pure wishful thinking. Mr. Chopra just plays the God card everytime he is faced with a dilemma that is unexplainable or difficult to understand. The God card in this case is more like a Joker, it serves no purpose and is just a laugh.   Mr. Chopra does have good stories to tell, but they serve no relevance to God or finding him. His writing is not bad, but it is also not very good. I find Mr. Chopra to be a very weak thinker who ignores all rational arguments and ways of logic and reason to further exonerate his wishful thinking and enforce the idea of God in his reality. If you are interesting in a book relating Science and Spirituality I would recommend Amit Goswami's "The Self-Aware Universe". I do not recommend this book at all, especially to other skeptics. Mr. Chopra not only seems to have a rather negative and close minded view of skeptics but he completely shuts them out and addresses them in a rude manner.  I have kept an open mind in reading this book, but Mr. Chopra has not, in fact he hasn't shown much evidence of an intelligent "mind" at all.   This book receives two stars just for effort and a few interesting tidbits. 
 I received emails about delaying my order three times. Since it showed that the product was available, I didn't understand why I had to wait less than two months to get my order. I was so disappointed by the Amazon this time! Doing business like that, I am not sure how long you will survive 
 ...somehow Sundazed screwed up the remastering. Several tracks sound overmodulated. It's the same sound you get when you overload a digital recorder, and I suspect that's what happened somewhere along the line when  this CD was made. It is a loud CD. It's frustrating because it's obvious  that Sundazed used the session tapes. If not for the added distortion, this  would be a great sounding CD from start to finish. If this had happened to  one of the Beatles CDs, the problem would have been corrected by now. But  since it's "only" a Raiders album, I guess we just have to put up  with this sloppiness. By the way, Sundazed did do a "fix" on  their "Revolution" CD, which had the same problem. The noise was  very obvious on that release, so I guess Sundazed felt they had to redo it.  As for the other PRR CD they released in '96, "Something  Happening", it has the same problem and apparently no fix has been  done. Luckily, some cuts on "Happening" are totally free of the  noise 
 I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.   Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.  This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
 I dont see the point in this, the Mighty bright LED light lasts a lifetime because it uses L.E.D. therefore you will not need replacement. Besides that the product photo of this "replacement bulbs" show ordinary light bulps, not LED !! 
 This isn't a very good text, especially for anyone new to the field. The quality of some of the diagrams/figures is third rate (to say the least). There are frequent mistakes in derivations and equations.   Nicholas, Research Fellow (Physics 
 While, this book was informative, it was a chore to read. While chronological, it seemed disjointed and was difficult to finish. I couldn't believe this book won some sort of award and only slogged through it because it was a gift from someone who met the author at a wedding 
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 This wasn't a very entertaining movie at all. I guess I am one that likes to be happily entertained when I actually find the time to spend ~2 hrs in front of a movie and this just didn't do it. I was annoyed most of the time I watched it. The ending stunk too. Like another reviewer pointed out, Jennifer A.'s character had all these things she wanted him to learn, and then, when he 'goes there', she still walks away. Don't waste your time! 
 While the concept of this book makes sense, application in the life of  a mother doesn't. I have four children and can't possibly retrain myself to think only in terms of my stomach. Basically the author wants you to think about how you sit, stand, carry your baby, cough, sneeze, lie down, get up and that's on top of the daily excercise routine. As an added bonus, she tells you that one jacknife can undo weeks of work! I know that at 3 am if one of my children starts crying, I don't stop to think about how to properly get out of bed first. I'm just trying to quiet my child before all of the others are awake too. That's too much of a time investment for me to make just to mess it up with one mistake.  
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 The music wasn't bad, however the vocals are a MAJOR disappointment.  I kept expecting something better with each song.  Then I realized the problem; there was no raw feelings conveyed, no personality, no life.  You can't sing blues songs with a polished pop voice 
 Not very readable, didn't find it interesting, after going through the first part of the book i put it somewhere and never bothered to completely read it 
 This book is pretty weak.  It reads like a list of cliches taken from James Bond and every other cheapo action book you could imagine.  The women are all beautiful and mainly interested in sex with the hero; the Nazis (of course) wear big boots and are psychotic; the head of the secret government agency has to come to beg the hero to come out of retirement for one more job; there are shoot-outs and fist fights galore.....  I think you get the point.  The language is at its worst during the romantic scenes, which are barely one step above Romance novel cliches.  I will give the book the following.  There is a ton of action from stop to start.  But generally, this is a weak thriller 
 I am not a fan of this book. He begins by saying Do not use complicated words when a simple one will do. Then he continues by using complicated words throughout the entire book. He proceeds by telling the reader to do everything they were told not to do: use "I" and start sentences with "but." He is the only person I have heard of that is pro "I" and I refuse to do poorly on future essays because he likes it whereas no one else does. Much of his style is completely subjective--he doesn't explain well why he likes some phrases and dislikes others. One thing I'm sure of, no matter what I'd write, he'd hate it, including this review. In my opinion, the author can be described by words he uses frequently in the book: pompous and utterly (he'd say that word is unecessary but oh, I think it is) pretentious 
 When I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice.  Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny.  On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected.  We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix "challenged" that it just isn't funny anymore.  I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 This is a WONDERFUL film, but this copy of the print is NOT good, and not worth the savings.  Pay a little more if you have to to a distributer who bothered to do a good job 
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 I read The Last Tycoon, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and I thought that it was really bad. All it was about was the incredibly boring life a movie producer, the affairs of the same man and his partner, and I felt that all  of the events in the book were ludicrous. Nothing like that happens in real  life. I could not stand the book 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 I picked this up after reading Calder's Dead Things trillogy which I enjoyed a great deal for its fetishistic, perverse, and increasingly disjointed world.   Frenzetta does create an interesting world which could provide an interesting story but it seems that Calder has lost his pace.  One of the major drives in Dead Things was the fetishistic intensity which he sucessfully integrated into the plot.  The same intensity is present in this book but the world he created disallows the same integration in to the story.   As a result, it comes off as obscessive rather than interesting.     I was even more dissapointed by The Twist so while this wasn't as good as I expected, it was still readable.   If you're a Calder fan, its worth a read... as long as you find it used.    Otherwise Calder needs to give up on the deadly dolly thing until he can make it work again 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 I agree with the reviewer who wrote the parental warning.  I tried to submit a similar review when I first got this book in December of 2000, but Amazon edited it out because I mentioned some of the chapter headings on various forms of sex covered in the book.  I guess in four years' time mentioning oral and anal sex has become more acceptable.  I bought the book because I had found Mavis Jukes' first book to be so helpful, wry and well written.  While this book is indicated as a book for pre-teens, it is much more advanced in it's sexual content than I felt my then 11 year-old was ready to read about.  Now that she is almost 15, I am thinking about bringing it down from the topmost shelf of the cabinet where it has collected dust for the last 4 years.  Be warned that it is not really appropriate reading for a pre-teen, at least not in my hosehold, and certainly not without heavy parental input and discussion. 
 except for Ray of Light, which is one of the best pop songs of 90s, the Power of Goodbye, Beautiful Stranger and Deeper and Deeper. Where are the remixes of Don't Cry for me Argentina, or You Must Love Me or the remake of American Pie? The half of the album is full of silly ballads and R&B-scented numbers like the rubbish It's Human Nature, the sleep-inducing (but mean to be a good ballad) Take A Bow which is the same with all Babyface songs, Bedtime Story which is the same as ever with anything Bjork has done in the past and so-so Secret. Frozen seems to be a nice standout but it doesn't feel sincere, and more or less sounds like Power of Goodbye... and the Music album was one of the worst albums Madonna crapped out so singles should not be different.  All in all, Madonna is not a slow number singer; her voice terribly sounds weaker than her dance numbers and that's why this greatest hits album was not successful as Immaculate Collection because the singles were already bad. This album reflects the spiral-down of Madonna through 90s to 2000s (except Ray of Light where she struck gold) where she hit the bottom with American Life and has not recovered herself. Go buy Immaculate Collection, Ray of Light album, down load one or two other songs at your disposal and you will have the good things Madonna has produced among the heap of redundant mass called pop music. 
 Being a big fan of Grant's unique guitar playing, I've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music.  As far as I know, this is the only book about him.  The book doesn't go into a great amount of  detail.  The discography and selected reviews are worth reading.  I'd say  your best bet to understanding Grant Green would be to spend the money you  would plunk down on this book on a good CD of his- Idle Moments, Green  Street, The Complete Quartets with Sonny Clark. Then you can really get  your money's worth.. 
 Maybe something got lost in translation but I think the wording and the sentences uttered by Ka and others seemed as if they were written by 5th graders.  I couldn't imagine people talking like this.  I forced myself to finish the book but the wording just "hurt my ears".  I read it based on the New York Times basically saying it was a great book.  This was not a great book, but maybe the translation was just bad??  Also, I am not sure if the author meant it or not but I got the impression from the writing and story that Turkish people aren't that bright.  It seemed to me he was putting down the muslim religion.  Anyway, that was minor, the writing was just bad, bad, bad. If you want to read stories that flow and wording that is like music to your ears (even though translated) read works by Naguib Mahfouz, especially The Cairo Trilogy. Now that is good stuff!

 I am an Asian cinophile, and I love suspense and action films.  I can also appreciate the asthetics of quiet, space, and subtlty.  This film really didn't move me on any of those levels however.  The eroticism was fleeting, suspense soggy, and drama weak.  Not recommended. 
 I thought this book was terribly dull and uninteresting.  I had to read this for a college course and was deeply disappointed in the material and the story line.  I had to literally force myself to stay awake and read another sentence.  Yes, it was that bad.  I do not reccomend this book to anyone.  In fact I have warned avid reads, like myself, to never pick the book up. I am a reader who likes thick plots, action, mystery, everything but what this book had to offer.    I do not think I learned anything that opened my mind to another culture or about life in general.  The book jumped around a lot between present and past and it was easy to get confused and disinterested.  Not to be too harsh but: horrible, horrible, horrible!  Save yourself the time, money, and effort.  Read another book 
 A normal Tour of Duty lasts 1 year. For Kerry, it only lasted 4 months. And in those four months, Kerry collected a record three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars and a Bronz Star? C'mon! If this were legitimate, Kerry would be a bigger hero than Audie Murphy!  I know it's old news now. This book was intended to be and was a political tool to help Kerry become president in 2004. Kerry lost decisively. It's over. But for Kerry to say that he did all of these things is absolute nonsense. For Douglas Brinkley to claim this as  history as like a movie producer claiming a fiction movie of a action hero (perhaps played by Chuck Norris) is history and reality too! C'mon! And there are still people giving this book five stars?   PT Barnum would be proud of the efforts of Kerry and Douglas Brinkley.   HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

 Recently, I purchased this item, as well as two smaller Dover sticker booklets.  I was disappointed with them.  They are only somewhat reusable.  As another letter-writer noted, they lose the stickiness.  They also are flimsy, made of paper with a coating; they tore easily when handled and curled up when removed from the first place where they were placed.  I hoped to purchase a product similar to ColorForms of years past.  Not the case.  While the idea is a good one for play and learning, these just aren't sturdy enough for rehandling.      
 A weak story line and a confusing plot ensured that I was complete lost somewhere in the middle of Jamica in the first few chapters.Was disappointing to read this work of Ludlum, who otherwise has had an untarnished reputation so far 
 Fans of the ABC-TV show "LOST" will probably be buying "Our Mutual Friend" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the "last book [I] ever [read]".  Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.  What a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, 'padded'.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages.   Dickens' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop', "I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing."  'OMF' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence.   Even worse is the ending.  Some endings just can't help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.  All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for "The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens' oeuvre or are required to read "Our Mutual Friend", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens' far superior works:  'David Copperfield', 'Oliver Twist', 'Pickwick Papers'.    If you are looking for 'LOST' reading material, I would refer you to 'Watership Down' (Excellent), 'The Stand' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), 'The Dark Tower' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to 'Our Mutual Friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke, Rousseau and Hume'.

 As someone involved in the consulting area for many years, I was unable to find any new idea that would make worthwhile to spend money in this book. Almost everything that is mentioned here can be grabbed from free articles availables in Internet,about this subject. Additionally, there are a good number of books that will help you much more to plan and implement ERP's. Last, but not least, the book only have a handful of small pictures and tables. Unacceptable for a modern book about business and technology topics 
 This book is another attempt to capitalize on a name brand (Porter; Harvard) as opposed to providing a substantive, insightful take on what is happening in Japan and what needs to be done in order to correct certain problems in the Japanese economy. It also gives the false impression that Japan is somehow a pre-mature version of the US. Porter is not a Japan expert and I would be very careful, as an American/foreigner, to not to take books on Japan by foreigners who have never lived their or speak the language too seriously. The book is not about Japan, it is a generalized theoretical black box solution to a much more complex problem in which one needs to understand a lot more than just management theory. Japanese management is much more complex and, unlike in the US where a monkey can be trained to fire people, Japanese managers have many more issues to deal with. People tend to forget the fact that Japanese managers have done a much better job (though moving more slowly) at reducing the negative impact of restructuring. Its more difficult to keep a company going and competitive when its against the law to fire people than if you could fire people on the spot-- US management "expertise" is incredibly over-rated the recent market correction shows the incredible amount of resources that are wasted by corporate America on such things as management consulting. Those foreigners who have written on Japan's economy and financial markets who have the language down (speaking; reading) and have been in-country for an extended period of time as expats can provide a very interesting and highly useful perspective for those looking from the outside in a way most Japanese cannot (and will not). Being a "senior advisor" to a few large Japanese companies does not qualify someone to write on this topic 
 This book crossed my path three times.  First was my undergrad thermo course, as a prescribed text.  I thought it was a little wordy but the verbosity did not contribute to my understanding.  The more they tried to explain the concepts (e.g., on Kelvin's and Clausius' statements of the second law of thermodynamics), the more confusing they became.  Needless to say, I didn't do too well.  That, however, is another story.  The second time was in my masters studies, and I was the TA for an undergrad thermo course (go figure).  I used this book for used examples and exercises for my students.  But it still didn't change my opinion on it.  Locating anything on thie text would take forever because one would have to peel through layers of words.    The third time, and also the last (hopefully) is in my Ph.D. programme.  I was flipping through the pages on the advanced topics (Maxwell's relations, Clapeyron's equation, etc.,etc.).  Their treatment were simply too trivial, and, with the lack of depth, I promptly put it back to the shelf.  Moran and Shapiro are, no doubt, authorities on thermodynamics, and I respect them very much, as experts in their area.  In their writing, it is quite clear that, they assume understanding can be achieved by loading concepts with words, the more the merrier.  In my opinion, if is more effective to go through the major concepts succinctly and formally, and go through their implications in more detail.  I think, this book fails utterly it this respect.  On the merit of its extensive collection of examples and exercises, I only recommend this book as supplemental.  As anything beyond that, however, the shear amount of diction alone will spell frustration for the novice, and redundance for the adept.  Finally, I think Cengel, and Holman do a much better job presenting the concepts at a beginner's level.  For the advanced topics (sans stat. mech. and quantum), I would opt for Callen, and Hatsopoulos and Keenan (if you can get your hands on it), with the latter as a reference.  Finally, for statistical and quantum mechanics, I would recommend Carter for a starter, and Atkins (Physical Chemistry) will do very well to fill the holes 
 I did not enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would.  They left out alot of the parts in the book where your mind could just picture it so clear and vivid.  I did this as a read aloud, slightly modified with my students.  I was really excited when I found a movie to go with it, and showed the class it.  It's rated PG, which for the material of the book is really a clue as to them leaving out alot of stuff.  My class enjoyed most of the book and felt the movie didn't do it justice.  I agree 
 I cancelled this order since I already had this DVD with a different front cover so I did not receive this product. Please check your records. Thanks, Mitzi Hei 
 This book is based upon Brenda Ueland's experience teaching creative writing to adults and her success at freeing many of her students from inhibitions that prevented them from writing well.  It is basically a "pep talk" for anyone who thinks they cannot write or have nothing important to say.   And it has some interesting insights about the mysterious nature of inspiration and the role leisure plays in creativity.  ["Leisure: The Basis of Culture," by Josef Pieper, is a more advanced exploration of this theme.]  However, the book is interlaced with so much dubious philosophy that I cannot recommend it.  For example, on page 129, Brenda begins with this gem:  "I have come to think that the only way to become a better writer is to become a better person."  However, she then ruins this thought by saying that by "better person" she does not mean a good person "for a great person often does things that so-called good people think very bad indeed."  She does not explain what she means by a great person.  But it seems to mean someone who is an independent thinker; an astute observer who does not accept social conventions or values that cannot be affirmed through their own inner wisdom.  Brenda does not consider the possibility that one's inner "truth" can be faulty.  She relies upon quotations from the poet William Blake (one of her great people), entitling Chapter Five: "Sooner Strangle an Infant in its Cradle than Nurse Unacted Desires," based upon one of his noble sentiments about deferred gratification.  Blake saw visions and heard voices which he believed were Divine rather than demonic.  Brenda also prefers this interpretation and thus agrees with Blake's conclusion that our inner voice which says "Thou shalt" is our true conscience, while the voice that counsels "Thou shalt not" is the product of learned behavior and should be rejected.  (See page 13 and footnote on page 35.)  Later, on page 174, the author reveals herself to be a ho-hum, garden-variety relativist.  She writes, "If it is true to you, it is true.  Another truth may take its place later.  What is truly from me is true, whether anybody believes it or not.  It is my truth."  The problem with all this philosophy is that the author tells the reader that they too must tend toward the amoral and asocial aspects of the psychopathic personality if they want to be an independent thinker and hence, a great writer.  She teaches that the end justifies the means.  Whatever gets the creative juices flowing is justified.  And the stream of consciousness that gushes forth, whether polluted or pristine, is art.  It is art because it is true to the inner self of the artist, who has learned to cast off all restraint, fear, and ambition.  (I wonder what Brenda would think about the latest notions of modern psychology that radical independence is a less mature emotional state than cooperative inter-dependence?)  Finally, the author presents her view as an either/or scenario.  Either you adopt the reckless and rule-less approach to writing, or you're creativity will be stymied.  She does not allow for the option that one can be creative and value-oriented at the same time.  Potential readers of this work should be aware that behind the enthusiastic pep talk there lurks a relativistic philosophy which may not correspond with their personal beliefs 
 this product is not what I expected.  I was hoping that my daughter would like to help me bake......  well she was afraid to touch the mat, especiall when my fingers were burned by it.  I did't like how it worked.  
 There's not an ounce of meat in this book.  This book features a steady stream of the author's self-praise and excessive "name-dropping".  The "conclusions" are certainly not original.  The thesis of the book is never really developed and the text is directionless and slow. 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 In a typical neoclassicist's manner Mr. Hanson avoids talking about the Jewish-Christian basis of western culture. This is a problem because the actual reason for the decay of the Greek and Roman classics is not that they have been made unattractive by classics departments but that already in antiquity people found something more challenging in Jewish and Christian culture. The 'death of Homer' is not a modern phenomenon. The following books are a few examples of the vast literature on the subject: Michael Walzer, Exodus and Revolution; Walter Wink, Engaging the Powers; Ramsay MacMullen, Christianizing the Roman Empire 
 First of all, this book is NOT on the recommended list of formation books that has been put out by the US Bishops even though it is widely used by many catholic schools. Even though its doctrine is sound, its approach to teaching our faith may be confusing to teens.  It has a "we understand what it is like to be a teen" mentality.  My teen is using it at school and is constantly uncomfortable by the insinuations in the book that a teen should be having a crisis in their faith at this age. This book presents the catholic faith as "just another suggestion. 
 If you are interested in Kabbala, it is best approached within the framework of a lifestyle observant of Jewish Law.  As one reads Gershon Scholem's books the thoughtful reader will quickly realize that he does not believe what he is writing. His point of view is intellectual only and he did not in his lifetime practice.   Anyone can take some of the principles of Kabbala and use them to get some pretty cool results. The unfortunate thing is that the earlier comment that you can get the same feelings from reading a dungeons and dragons book was absolutely true. The author of the Zoar, and the real kabalistic texts assume that the only people reading them would be Torah Observant Jews.   For the Kabbala to be explored, even slightly, requires the same strict adherence to Torah that the early masters had. Anything less is folly. Yes you can have nice feelings that are real, but you can get those practicing tai chi, you can meditate deeply, but anyone can do that counting sheep.  These people who say that this books and all others by Gershon Scholem are a waste of time are correct, but don't allow that to convince you that Kabbala is not of value. He did not know that he approached it in the wrong way, but you don't have to.   If you are interested in learning Kabbala do not purchase this book. 
 Racer takes on a rookie. Wow. We've never seen that before, have we? The worst thing about this movie are the race scenes, many of which resemble a video game. I'd rather watch ABC Sports' "To Live and Drive the Indy 500." That's more realistic AND much more fun 
 The bike was easy to put together, but what a pain to use! The front of the bike came pre-assembled and was not straight! So the bike would not go straight. I was very disappointed and even more so when I when to return it. The Shipping was very expensive and that was not refundable! I do not recomend this item!!! 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 Good thing saving the would doesn't depend on weather Barry Manilow can swing. because we'd all be in deep sh*t.  Manilow is not capable of swinging, he doesn't have a swingin' bone in his body.  He sounds like he can't keep up with the ebergy of the band.  Manilow is the last person on earth who should be singing with a big band.  Barley Man Enough just doesn't pull this off.  Too bad.. 
   These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty.  It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material.  My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor.  Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an "overstich" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off.  There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.     They DO look nice from afar and seem warm (I only tried them on quickly), but for the price...yikes 
 Since there aren't many books out there on Painter, I grabbed this book as soon as I saw it figuring that the Illustrator and Photoshop information would be a bonus. What a disappointment - the very day I received the book I resold it on Amazon. The book's title "Side by Side" describes exactly what you can expect to find inside this book - a comparison of the three programs. I can't see where having this book would be useful since it really doesn't describe techniques or provide useful information, or do anything more than cite differences between the programs, which any user would already be aware of anyways. Rather than waste your money on this useless book, I'd recommend the WOW books and/or Kelby's photoshop books - they're packed full of useful information. This book gets one star for the pretty pictures 
 I am surprised by all the good reviews this book has received.  To start with, this book is mainly about a woman who says 1) she isn't very good at housework and 2) just plain doesn't want to do it, so she hires it out. Now, mind you, there is *nothing* wrong with that attitude, people hire out tasks all the time for those very reasons.   However, throughout the book, she makes derogatory assumptions such as:  Housekeeping is a no skills/low skills job People who choose to be housekeepers aren't very smart Children can't be trained to take over housekeeping tasks  And so on--too many to list here, and then in other parts of the book she goes and contradicts some of her previous statements.  Her arguments for hiring a housekeeper are of the whiny, I-shouldn't-have-to-do-this-demeaning-work type, and she brings up the tired, "traditional" man vs. woman arguments, as well as "we're all too busy". Do men and women argue over housework? Of course, but these days usually the arguments are neatnik vs. slob, not about who's doing (or not doing) the dishes. Are people busier than they used to be? Maybe, but that is a choice you make, not something forced on you.   Children need some chores to teach them life skills for when they leave home--the few chores she leaves for children in her book are a joke. If you're willing to take the time to train a new housekeeper, why not spend that quality time training your children instead? Not to mention that, if you're truly willing to pay for housekeeping, why not pay family first?  She has a cost justification worksheet, where for example she states that you save money by having your housekeeper prepare your meals. Well, no, you're shifting the costs from buying convenience foods and/or eating out to paying your new employee. And, by the way, her website where she says there are forms to use does not work.  In one way, this book was unintentionally funny--in the back she has a list of references. In it, she lists books such as The Sidetracked Sisters Catch Up On the Kitchen.  If she'd taken time to actually *read* the book, and their first book, Sidetracked Home Executives, she would have learned that it would not be necessary to hire a housekeeper. Once you go to all the trouble to clean up for the housekeeper and get a system in place (which Sherman insists on, by the way, so that a housekeeper will *want* to work for you), the little that is left to do could easily be accomplished by her children, her, and her husband. For example, one of the DAILY tasks for her housekeeper is to vacuum the entry, living room, etc. Well, if you have a "no shoes" policy, you could vacuum once a week, or even every other week.    After reading this book, I still was not convinced that hiring out your housekeeping would allow you to increase your income, or even save you money, although it might make you feel better.   Now, on the other hand, a housekeeper would be quite helpful, say if you have several children under 5 at home, or are looking into one for an elderly parent, you're recovering from surgery, etc., and for someone in these situations, this book would be helpful for overcoming objections to hiring one.  But for the vast majority of people, let's be honest, hiring out housekeeping is a *luxury*, not a necessity.   The book has a few useful food recipes, some tips on getting your point across, and a sample housekeeper schedule that you might find useful. Borrow from your library first, before buying.   I also suggest that people read "Your Money or Your Life" along with this book to get some perspective. Would you rather do a little housework here and there on your terms and timetable, or work at a job that not only costs you money to go to, but puts restrictions on how you spend your time and creates extra stress in your life so that you can hire a housekeeper 
 I had hopes that this magazine would be a nice alternative to the others out there.  From the moment I opened it, it felt so smug.  I gave it a chance and read it cover to cover (the April issue).  But what finally did me in (after having read that I could buy an $800 blouse to make me feel pretty in that after pregnancy stage, that I could match my children's shoes to my Jimmy Choo's and finally that I could buy my child the latest $300 tricycle) was the article entitled "Normal" about a child who was misdiagnosed with Autism.  The article discussed how distraught the mother was after her child was diagnosed with Autism to the point that she tried to committ suicide.  The article ended with the fact that the child turned out to be a genius.  What was the point of this article?  To say thank God it wasn't true?  What about those parents out there who have an autistic child, how does this article make them feel? The article was painful and insensitive.  There are better ways to spend you $10 than on Cookie 
 I was really excited about Joe Hill's Heart-Shaped Box. Finally, a horror novel that was praised by critics and fans alike. I knew this was some sort of modern take on the age-old ghost story. I was expecting a fun, thrilling ride, when what I really got out of this book was a tedious, typical and not very original ghost story. I've read this one before. Too many times in fact.  Jude Coyne is an aging rock star with a taste for younger women. He also collects weird, paranormal items. When his clerk finds a supposedly haunted suit for sale on an online auction site, Jude can't resist. He buys it,receives it and... ta-dam! A ghost comes after him. Of course, this sale wasn't the random buy it first seemed to be. Soon enough, this novel turn into a ghost story, a revenge story, a road story... In fact, this book doesn't really know what it wants to be at all.  Bring in the ouija board. Bring in the loved pets who will do everything to protect their master. Bring in the possession scene where a human being taken by the ghost. Bring in the long flashbacks sequences that repeat everything we already know. Bring in the good friend that dies eraly in the novel. Bring in the abusive father. Bring in the beautiful, if somewhat mentally damaged sidekick and love interest. The only thing refreshing about this book is the main character himself. With think that Jude is a rude, bitter man and I really liked the fact the he was cold and had no feelings and had probably brought all of this upon himself. But a late twist in the story changes all that and turns Jude into a first-rate, powerless victim.   And as the story builds and builds and builds, I suddenly got a bit excited because it was geering towards a fun, energetic finale. Instead, the book ends with a dud, an easy way out. All too disappointing after putting so much effort into reading this one.   Instead of truly being original, this books brings back every cliche the horror genre has to offer and never even tries to make them original. It's not enough to use an aging rock start as a protagonist to make your story stand out. Throughout, I kept thinking the author was trying too hard to imitate horror master Stephen King. The characters, the locations, the style of writing... It was all to similar to King. I wasn't surprised at all to learn, after the fact, that Hill is, in fact, King's son.   Heart-Shaped Box isn't the great horror novel people are now calling it. I've read this one too many times before to actually like it, or recommend it.  
 Dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck,dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck,more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, and more dreck, and more dreck, and more dreck . . . you get the idea 
 I received this book for Christmas and was annoyed by the writing style within the first 50 pages.  The story itself isn't bad, but I found the writing styles simplistic and like I said before, annoying.  The four main characters have no chemistry.  They are supposed to be the best of friends but you never feel any emotion out of any of them.  The same phrases are also uttered over and over and over again.  Here these people are, on the brink of something magical and amzing that they have found that will turn the world on the edge and all you hear constantly uttered out of one of the character's mouth is, "I sure wish I knew."    Hey look, I can't believe it, how did those people build gateways to other worlds?  Boy, I sure wish I knew.  Hey!  Look at that amazing and terrifying flying insect, how does it fly with such small wings?  I sure wish I knew.  Maybe I expected too much of this book since I don't read sci-fi only.   But as I said, I could hardly finish this book much less read anything else written in this style.  What a shame = 
 This isn't a kids book at all. The message behind it is one of choice, making reference to a woman's right to choose through horton and the planet. I don't care what your views on abortion are (anti or pro), you shouldn't let young children read and decyfer the hidden meaning. Dr. Seuss was a nut job and a child corrupter, don't support his work.  
 In his centerpiece "exposure" -- the oil-for-food program -- Eric Shawn simply ignores the facts.  For starters, US government reports document that the biggest chunk of billions going into Saddam's pockets came from oil smuggled outside the UN program through neighboring countries -- and that the White House and Congress not only knew for years this was going on, but authorized special legal exemptions for Turkey and Jordan so the smuggling could continue. Given what Shawn pretends to do, the book is worthless without such material.  He is a practitioner of  misdirection and blatant propaganda.  Shameful stuff.  Too bad one star is the minimum rating, this book deserves zero stars 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 The heater works fine, but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet. DeLonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period. I will not buy an oil-filled heater again 
 By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 Robert Allen's previous book, Multiple Streams of Income, is EXCELLENT and I can't say enough good things about it.  This one was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT in comparison.  He talks about the same rehashed Internet marketing strategies that everyone else does.  Creating email lists, newsletters, blah, blah, blah...  The most disappointing thing about Robert Allen -- and I lost so much respect for him over this -- is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast.  What's stupid about the whole thing, and demonstrates that he's a snakeoil salesman scam artist, is that what he's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the Internet...so how do you make money on the Internet?  According to Robert Allen, by selling courses showing people how to make money on the Internet is the only way to make money on the Internet.  That's a scam!  How does he sleep at night?  Don't buy this book.  It's a waste of money 
 This book reads like a hand picked set of scientific facts woven together to support the argument that dogs are not man's best friend at all.  Although interesting and informative in some parts, this book is also repetitive, meandering and overly negative in others.  The first half of the book runs through some interesting observations about the genetics of dogs and their behavioural links to wolves.  This is interesting and you can read through it in one enjoyable sitting.  However, as the book goes on you notice that Budiansky gets more and more negative about dogs, using a thinly veiled veneer of science to try and make his arguments look objective.  He basically describes domestic dogs as being inferior mutations of wolves.  He seems to be trying to tell us that we need to face up to the fact that our dogs don't love us, but that instead they are using us like parasites.  Moreover, all their signs of affection, play and obedience are actually just instinctive behaviours that have evolved to help them in the wild.  OK - if this corresponds to your experience with dogs then this is the book for you.  For me, I haven't got time to read all the underlying scientific papers but this just doesn't square away with empirical evidence.  Budinsky himself makes a point of the fact that comparatively little scientific research has been conducted on dogs.  This doesn't seem to stop him from using what has been done to denigrate them.  Overall this book doesn't give man's best friend any credit at all, and I suspect that many dog owners would find it quite disturbing.  The fact that it tries to use science to back up its bias claims is even more troubling 
 Wow. I had so much respect for Karajan before these recordings; I still do, but not as much. While before I viewed Karajan as being almost immortal in any interpretation of any symphony, I now know otherwise. If you want a good recording of the first symphony, get the 1964 edition of the "Originals" by Deutsche Grammophon. Karajan conducts that version much better than this one, I mean he totally butchered the first symphony here. As for the 3rd, he also trips. His 3rd symphony is not as textured or multicolored as his other recordings of the 3rd. His 2nd and 4th, while having some merits, is for the most part, dry, muddy, and without the passionate flame and directness that Brahms has to be played with 
 This book was not entertaining.  I suffered through each page.  I hated the plot and most of the characters.  I will never read another Doss book again 
 Although my nursing school required this book, it is the most confusing and least helpful of all the 9 books I have on care planning and nursing diagnoses. I haven't met anyone who likes this book or finds it user friendly. In all the other books the rationales are written right after the interventions,this book does not use that format making it time consuming and frustrating. The book is unorganized and hard to follow. If this is not a required book,save your money for your tuition. 
 Does Turtledove devoutly wish the South had won the Civil War for its own sake, or is he just one of those admirers of Robert E. Lee (there were many at my alma mater, Vanderbilt) who can't bear that his hero came out on the losing side? Either way, surely Turtledove could have come up with a better vehicle for reversing the outcome of the Civil War than South African racists traveling back in time to arm the American rebels with yet-to-be-invented guns. The thugs of the 21st century have misjudged the motives of the noble South and the nobler-still Lee, but the general will accept their weapons anyway, thank you. This trick presages the wooden plotting and shallow characterizations to come. Turtledove's main non-historical character is a teacher-soldier who seems to come out of and return to nowhere, with no mention of family or background. Characterization in general has Turtledove stumped, so he turns to cliches, such as the prostitute with a heart of gold (this one masquerades as a male and dons a uniform to serve the Confederacy and service the main character). Turtledove even has a tragic mulatto woman on a postwar auction block. Blacks are few and rare in Turtledove's novel, and they are swept off the stage after the briefest of appearances, speaking only conventional phrases, and in dialect, of course. Both the rupture of the American Union and the continued births and deaths of millions of Americans in slavery (his Lee fashions a gradual emancipation in which blacks will "earn" their freedom decades into the 20th century) are treated by Turtledove as worthy of little more than a shrug. The more ambitious but nearly as wooden "alternate history" novel, Ward Moore's "Bring the Jubilee," at least was very sober about the consequences of a rebel victory. If you are going to reverse the outcome of a war so momentous in American and world history, don't do it as trivially as Turtledove has done in this book. There is potential for a great story in the fictional reversal of the outcome of our Civil War, but "The Guns of the South" is not it 
 What a disappointment! Poorly written, bitter, jealous and small minded. Less said the better 
 These are as pathetic an excuse for an item as I have ever seen. Let's begin: First, the magnets are about as big as an eraser from the top of a pencil, tiny in other words, and they come shipped just loose in a small plastic bag.   Okay, that would be fine if that was the only complaint. But, thgey just don't work well. For all the "high" power, I could only get a single magnet to hold 2 sheets of paper, not the 10 promised. Only way, one could hold 10 were if it were tissue paper.   These magnets are a joke and Amazon should be a little ashamed for offering them for sale. 
 This is a work of poor scholarship.  The author's account of Egyptian Jewry is politically filtered.  First, he claims that Egyptian Jews were not supportive of Zionism.  Every Zionist movement was representated in Egypt, and active.  He also suppresses evidence that some prominent Egyptian Jewish personalities were Zionists.  For example, he talks at length about Mourad Farag, but does not mention that he was a passionate Zionist.  Farag's work, Al Kudsiyat, goes unmentioned.     MOreover the largest percentage of Egyptian Jews (45%) went to Israel.  The remainder were scattered between the U.S., France, and other countries, so Israel got the lion's share  The author also trivializes the anti-semitism that existed in Egypt long before the Zionist movement.  There were at least 10 cases of blood libels in the second half of the 19th century.  Moreover, even Egyptian Jews who lived in Egypt for generations were denied citizenship.  He only briefly mentions the Company Law that denied Eygptian JEws their livelihood.  Though he mentioned the three massacres of 1948 in which nearly 90 Jews were murdered, he forgets to tell the reader that no serious trial took place.    The author dwells extensively in the Lavon affair, but only because he can blame Israel.  He does not tell the reader that not one Egyptian or foreign soul was killed or hurt during the sabotage operation.  He also refuses to admit that Egypt committed a crime by condemning two of the ring leaders to death.  The author's political bias blinded him and turned him into a poor schola 
 While I consider Bleeding Through to be a great band, and their studio music is well worth owning, this dvd is not worth the purchase. The documentary about the band is informative and sheds light on the members and how the band was formed, the live material is horrible. At best, it sounds like it came off of a cheap tape recorder held by a fan. I was hoping for something more professionally created. I for one can hope that if they decide to release live footage in the future that they take the time to think of their fans instead of ripping them off with a horrible concert. Also, the information provided on the cover claims there are two music videos when in truth, there is only one. 
 What is the longevity of John Bradshaw's book, and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time?  The book was published over ten years ago, and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards, of which it was a part.  The first thing I noticed about Bradshaw's writing is its sheer verbosity.  He writes in a roundabout way, rather than concisely and to the point.  Contrast him, for example, with a writer on Buddhism or Taoism (say, Alan Watts?).    Writing on Buddhism or Taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise, but the human growth movement is broad and billowy, and concise writing may not be important to the authors.    And Bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement, to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all: Shame.  Bradshaw reports that he is a theologian, but also someone who recovered from alcoholism, and was deeply shamed as a child, which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome.    There are many fine snippets from his book, which may be of use to folks, but overall, I think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations.  To paraphrase another well-known quotation, "People cannot live on concepts alone."  If he had given more personal studies or little case histories, it would have been much more helpful.  Instead, he includes page after page of some "guided" meditations or shame inquiries, which were totally useless to me.  If you are looking for guided meditations, this is the place for you.    So, in all, Bradshaw's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time, in my opinion.  It's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth.  Anyway, it was a bestseller once, and that's what counts, I guess.  It did have its 15 minutes of fame, and a lot of books never even get that.  Diximus.     
 I am a product of the Compton school system, and I have taught here for the last 15 years. In that time I have come across a number of Teach for America (TFA) teachers, who are generally young white Ivy League graduates who have set out to save us poor black and brown folks. We refer to TFA in my teacher lounge as "teach for a while," as most of these folks use Compton as the launching point for their graduate school applications. I'd like to read a book about a teacher who has stayed in the classroom for more than a couple of years. TFA is a nice idea, but I question whether they do more harm than good by becoming part of children's lives and then taking the first bus out of town 
 Will Young, the guy who fooled the voters into the fact that he had a girl all the way through the competition and then announced he was gay.  The singing is alright.  But I prefer a musican who is more thruthful than this guy 
 I'll just start out by saying that the artwork was very misleading.  It looks like the music would have been dark and disturbing or violent (the Parental Advisory supports it).  This music is not disturbing, nor is it violent, there are only 3 songs with swears (why is there the parental advisory?) etc.  I enjoy disturbing things so this assumption was my fault.  However this doesn't mean that I was unable to enjoy the music simply because it didn't live up to my assumption from the artwork.  A few songs like the Closest are good and the keyboard usage is good, but the thing that mainly brings this band down is the vocalist.  It sounds as if he's stretching the lyrics, taking forever to say what could have been said in a normal amount of time.  It got very annoying, very quickly.  A lot of the music is very calm, but is surprising as my eye caught the fact that it was produced by Ross Robinson (Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Amen) so I find that this is a step away from producing his normal Nu-Metal and into things that are more calm.  Anyways, a few of the songs are good and have good riffs, but it's the vocalist that drags this band down the most.  Vex Red isn't that great, sorry to disappoint you.  I'll give this 2 stars because of the song the Closest and the fact that a few parts of the songs instrumental wise are good but over all Vex Red offers nothing special.  
 Just outside Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, is the small township of Kezi, where life revolves around the bus that comes in from Bulawayo and the Thandabantu store, where everything can be bought and where the population gathers on the veranda to discuss the events of life. During the liberation struggle the old men are replaced by soldiers - both male and female- that take a rest here. But it becomes apparent in the book that a lot of these soldiers are quite deranged. One such soldier kills a girl, Thenjiwe, and mutilates her sister, Nonceba. After a long stay in the hospital, where she tries to regain her physical well-being and mental health, Nonceba follows the ex-lover Cephas of her dead sister to Bulawayo, where they live as brother and sister, two people forever wounded by the war of independence.  When written this way the book seems to hold a lot of promise for a very moving book. However, it took me nearly the whole book to get into the story. Yvonne Vera uses a lot of metaphors in which she couples different senses: she describes sounds in visual terms, tastes  she compares to sounds etc and the book is really packed with this. I really had problems understanding what was going on to a point that it actually got me very irritated. However, the end of the book (with the least metaphors) is a very loving description of two hurt people trying to make the most of their lives 
 I was really excited when I saw this item was out!  I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it.  I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right.  So, you can only use it to go up down or left.   BIG Dissapointment.  Don't waste your $$ 
 From Lind, verbatim: "Who won and who lost the Vietnam War?  The only complete losers were the officials of South Vietnam, whose state was erased from the map."  May the dead, maimed and mourning    find some comfort that their misery could be yet more abject: they could be suffering the pain of the war's cartographic consequences. "Necessary War"? - Unnecessay B.S 
   I've been waiting for this season, literally, for years.  It contained (notice the past tense) the funniest scene ever in the entire run of the show.  It was in the emergency clinic in the episode "My Sister, My Sitter" where the scene pans around showing the patients.  Smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down.  When I first saw that, many years ago, I literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like I needed a padded room.  She didn't even understand the joke when I explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of "hiding" the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable.  This DVD cut has been cut and makes Smithers reply about not letting Lisa ahead of him make no sense.  One of my favorite things about the Simpsons was that they didn't care who they offended.  Well they went PC and now I'm highly offended!  If they hadn't messed with it I would give them 5 stars, or more realistically I wouldn't have bothered to write this review.  Quit tampering with the show, FOX!! 
 I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it, the remote didn't work. I did everything it said to do and it still didn't work. So, I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty. When I took it out, the remote to it also didn't work. It says it has to be on "Play" (not Try me or Off) and it has to do it's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope. You should be able to control the volume, the song options, and be able to switch from colors to music but no. It just plain doesn't work. I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly, I will have to take it back but this time I'll get my money back......I do not suggest buying this product 
 I've seen better books that offer help in this area, but for the price I paid, it was still worth it.  My kids can use it to gain some insight.  It is very easy reading, too 
 THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD, SO I BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU LIKE RAP YOU'LL LIKE THIS CD, BUT IF YOU HATE IT, DON'T BOTHER 
 This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons.  1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub.  2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant  3. It is clunky  4. Does not comke with a power adapte 
 I found the material a good read but I dislike the format it was presented in. I hope in future Lisa Marie Rice has her material in book format also 
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 This book is essentially a prediction -- a prediction of how a given generation of teens would turn out. As such, it is particularly easy to rate -- all one has to do is wait a few years and see whether the prediction came true. As defined by the authors, the first batch of Millenials graduated from college a year ago, and the second one will graduate in two month. So..  Academic performance throughout US colleges has remained at 1990's level: "high-octane academic achievement" did not materialize. Prediction failed.  Use of marijuana among high school and college students is INCREASING after a continuous decrease in 1980's and 90's. Prediction failed.  Alcohol abuse among the same group is holding steady, instead of decreasing. Prediction failed.  Teen pregnancies as a whole are decreasing, but pregnancies among unmarried teens are actually RISING; total statistic is due to sharp decrease of pregnancies among MARRIED teenagers. Prediction failed.  Politically, "Millenial" college students are more fiscally conservative and more socially liberal than any generation on record -- EXACT OPPOSITE of what Howe predicted. College Republicans are on the rise, and their Libertarian branch especially so. Prediction failed dismally.  If the authors were in weather forecast business, they'd be out of job by now 
 When I first purchased the low-budget movie named "Pranks", I didn't really know what to expect.  After all, "Pranks" is a slasher/horror movie from the 80s, a very fertile period for such movies and time period which quite honestly produced some pretty good slasher and horror movies in general...unfortunately, after viewing "Pranks", I can honestly say that this is not one of them.  "Pranks" is about a group of college kids who are staying on campus over the holidays preparing a building which is going to be torn down I think (herein lies another problem in that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in this movie because the acting is so poor).  Obviously, most kids have gone home for Christmas and New Year's except for this group of kids and one "weird" kid who ostensibly becomes the lead suspect as gruesome murders begin to occur.    The murders remain largely unbeknownst to the characters in the movie, so the director and screenplay writer wanted to give the audience information to which the main characters are not privileged.  The plot is decent enough although the execution is formulaic/generic and lacks luster throughout the film.  One of the reasons for this is the pathetic acting we see in this movie, which really overshadows any kind of merit this movie is able to produce as a horror movie.    There is no question that "Pranks" is a low budget production to begin with and along with that, there is going to be some subpar acting, but the acting in "Pranks" is borderline-awful!!  It is this acting and poor direction that really makes it difficult for the tasteful horror movie viewer to stay interested.  In fact, the movie comes off very generic in style and substance, and rather predictable and boring.  The only thing that is even remotely interesting are the kills which aren't too bad considering the era in which this movie came out from.    The Director does use some weak misdirection to attempt to keep the audience guessing as to who the killer is, but the savy horror movie audience can clearly identify the "weird guy" as a "red herring" as another reviewer put it.  In summary, "Pranks" is a poorly executed attempt at a horror movie which suffers from terrible acting, extremely poor production values and flawed direction.  The result is a dull, boring and weak horror movie with a few decent kills...certainly nothing to write home about.  Also, as a final note, the actor who plays the killer does a terrible job and comes off, in the end at least, like a total wuss 
 The dimensions of this bookbag where not stated.  The bookbag is extremely smaller than the photo depicts. I had to pay double shipping sending it back. A big disappointment 
 As mentioned previously, there is no cohesion in this book. The author arranges her tale in chronological chapters, but there is no order within any individual chapter. For example, she examines things that happened in 1945 before mentioning events that took place in 1939. This would be forgivable if there were any sense of drama to the proceedings - but there is none. Just anecdote after anecdote strung together like birds on a wire.  I hope it's this lackluster, anemic presentation that made me dislike Dorothy as the book ground on. Some attention is given to her politics, but much more of the book is focused on her love affairs, her dogs, her husbands, her inability to save money. She was a flawed woman, but the author presents her flaws without any attempt to get us to understand Parker.  Overall, this book was about 100 pages too long, written in a competent but bland style that presents facts instead of personality. Strangely, the only time Meade dropped her even-handed, respectful tone was in talking about Lillian Hellman. She writes about the actress with barely concealed contempt, as if Hellman had personally injured her. Maybe Meade should have written Hellman's bio, instead... she'd probably have brought more passion to the table 
 PRODUCT MADE MY HAIR STICKY AND GOOEY. I AM A PERSONAL FAN OF HIS AND IT GOT RUSHED TO MARKET.  NEEDS RE FORMULATIN 
 After reading the Oprah Pick, "What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in "Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do."  It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages.  I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.    I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.    I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope 
 On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: "Extremely funny!". I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression 
 I found this over-priced book to be of no use to me at all...the reader was/is expected to do ALL the work while the author offers practically no help nor any self-help roads.. 
 Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded.  Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey 
 Although it was a chore to overlook the poor writing - the stories were interesting.  However, because the writing was so poor, especially from someone so well educated, I can't help but doubt the author's credibility 
 I guess some people out there actually liked this, but not here. "From Out Of Nowhere" is somewhat decent, but after that the rest of this blows dead bears. I especially hate "Epic" which if not for this the group would never had made it. I guess because of the diversity to the song that made it popular, but it made me want to gag, and then vomit as the song doesn't make sense to me for starters, and in the key of E, and just droning on and on for over 5 minutes that it's worse than the gas chamber. After that it just got worse. 17 years has come and gone, and it still stinks. 
 I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless. 
 This book is very well-intentioned, but it gives the same skin care advice to everyone, which is way off. My 82 year old mother gave me the book along with the request to get her a product to "combat oiliness." Hello? She's not a teen with an acne problem-- but a grandmother with dry skin and wrinkles. All to say that the book sounds very authoritative-- but is not sufficiently customized to really be of benefit in addressing the many different kinds of skin problems that different people with different skin have 
 I'm sorry, but I have to be the naysayer when it comes to these knives. The television ad claims that these knives never require sharpening, and that is simply not true. Yes, the knives were super sharp out of the box but after about a dozen uses they became completely dull. And don't even try to argue this point with Miracle Blade because their customer service base is practically non-existent, even though these knives are supposed to be guaranteed for life. All I got from this deal were empty promises and dull knives. If you truly want nice knives but don't want to spend a fortune on good German or Japanese steel, then I recommend you try out Forschner Victorinox products. They are very reasonably priced and are excellent products that should last you many, many years. Don't be seduced by the gimmick of Miracle Blade. The low cost of these knives today will not justify the replacement cost of new knives later. 
 I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.    The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized?   I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.    The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.    Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.  I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.  I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.  
 I did not feel this book at all. It falls so flat--everything might as well be a cardboard cut-out--that it's hilarious the main character is a celebrated writer. The structure of the story should work: a man living off his waning fame as the author of a celebrated novel leaves his prominence, and his leeching girlfriend, for a small village in France, hoping to recapture his inspiration and find some answers about his past.   Harris fails to deliver in all respects. The novel reads like a first draft, and I wish she'd realized her mistake and threw the manuscript in the fireplace. In light of character Jay's decision at the end and how it must reflect on Harris, you wonder why she even bothered in the first place. With Jay, Harris barely manages to creat a character more talented and wise than she is.   Absolutely terrible. Extra star for sustained effort 
 There is a real novelty in this book: for the first time ever in Cannel's cosmology, a Latino character (Ram?n) is not directly associated with crime, dirt and grease altogether. Well ... he is an illegal immigrant, but hey!, you can't have it all 
      For those of you who have sincerely been seeking the truth about the Holocaust, who have done your homework and read a variety of sources and opinions, this book may well push you completely over into the revisionist ("deniers") camp, as it did me.         Deborah Lipstadt is an Emory University professor of Jewish Religion, NOT history.  She was evidently supported by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in writing this book; they hold the copyright, not her.  Denying the Holocaust is an attempt to respond to Arthur Butz and others who have raised major factual objections to the usual "6 million Jews killed in gas chambers" version of WW II.         Arthur Butz gathered a wealth of research material in his book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century.  Ms Lipstadt responds to his scholarship with things such as name calling, twisted logic, half truths, appeals to emotions, failure to produce evidence, failure to define terms, omitting things, assigning bad motives, answering a question with another question, using big words, etc.  That is why I call her book, Denying the Holocaust, a Holocaust Liar's Handbook.  I value my copy as a wonderful exercise book for seeing through sophistocated lies.        
 I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me. 
 This book provides a good overview of blacks (slave and free) in New York. It's a very good reference (encyclopedic) book.  My main problem with it is that Leslie M. Harris, the author, relies heavily (if not entirely) on secondary sources. The book, then, is nothing more than a patchwork of various other more scholarly works. Hence, finding the actual primary source (i.e. court decision, council minutes, etc) proves extremely difficult.  I do not recommend this book for advanced students. If, however, you're interested in an easy read and don't care about sources, this is the book for you 
 A book of words and dubious references by "experts".  I cannot find any important educational references in this book.  As an expert in the field of Natural Medicine this is one book I would NEVER use 
 The first two short stories seem to have nothing to do with the main story. I couldn't stand Harriman. If an enginneer says it is impossible or the plan needs to be changed, he should agree with them and change it. The story itself is boring because you never learn much about the main characters 
 My Mother gave me this book.  Said it had changed her life and I have seen significant changes in her dealing with anger.  However, after reading the book...I don't get it.  Rubin points out a lot of ways that anger manifests itself.  Many of which I was aware of, some not.  Unfortunately he never tells you how to go about recognizing and expressing your anger and feeling okay with that.  He only tells you that you are better off doing so.  Luckily it was a quick read 
 This is a cute Vacuum, and that's about it. The filter clogs, and they are next to impossible to find. The Canister is a pain to empty. The biggest problem I found was there was no height adjustment. If you have thick carpet, you just need to forget about this vacuum. What A nightmare to push and pull this stupid thing. Mine has gone to Goodwill. 
 "Born", Bonds first album, was an incredibly inspiring and amazing album: varied, passionate, deeply enlivening. "Shine" is the opposite; repetitive tunes- uncreatively commercial and superficial; simply mediocre. Considering "Born" one of the best albums in my library, Shine was a total disappointment. I wasted $18 on an album I could't bear to hear more than once...what a contrast to their other work 
 I was really looking forward to this pillow, I have heard good things from my friends about them. First night was a bit odd, the pillow is very firm and takes some getting used to. I could also feel little beads under the cover, between the pillow and the cover. During the second night I could feel there were more little beads under the pillow case. I looked to see what was going on in the middle of the night, the pillow was leaking beads at an end seam. This is like a bean bag leak but the beads very small. So, after two nights this thing goes back and I clean up the beads. I am disappointed as the pillow itself felt good, but this is a mess. I am opting for a refund of the product and shipping. I don't think I want to roll the dice on a replacement, I'll find something else 
 I don't see how you can isolate "The Grand Inquisitor" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov.  I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!!  My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this.  It's excellent 
 Nicholsan's performance is without a doubt superior, but the material is second-rate.  Why anyone would want to make a movie like this, much less act in it, is beyond me.  It depicts a bunch of self-obsessed and depressed people(unless they're two-dimensionally portrayed egotistical and superficial snobs to whom the depressed losers feel superior) doing stupid things and being nasty to one another.  You just feel sad and frustrated after watching it, because it doesn't reflect life as it really is, or at the very least, it doesn't give a full view of life, just the small, mean, petty, grimy, sordid vision of one unhappy screenwriter who thinks they're being deep and insightful 
 I've taken a couple film classes in college thus far and I have to say - this book is not very enlightening.  For the most part, this book takes concepts about film and assigns them terms to call them.  It spends a lot of time stating the obvious and little time going into any significant depth on any topic.  It is a long book full of general information that you will already know if you are a regular movie-goer, nevermind a student of film.  It lacks significant coverage of the history of film and is excessively verbose.  I recommend avoiding it if you can and not paying the full price if you must buy it for class.  You can learn far more about film simply by doing searches in Google.  The freely available information on the Internet far surpasses the mediocre offerings of this book 
 Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.   
 This is not a great book. Even though it is Puzo, who has done some great work, this story is mediocre at best. I have read every work of fiction by Mario Puzo and I would place this one at the bottom of the pile. It's not a terrible book, but you could do a lot better. The story is about post WWII Germany, and an American soldier named Walter Mosca who is stuck in a daydream of post-war reorganization and exploitation. The story is slow at times, and I found my mind wandering a lot during the middle. It comes together nicely at the end, and is certainly well crafted, but I would recommend this book only to Puzo fans, especially to those interested in reading his complete catalogue. That is basically the only reason I read this book, and it is not one I care to read again. Nor is it a story that will live long in my memory.     Mark McGinty is the author of Elvis and the Blue Moon Conspirac 
   I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill.  I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).   That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.    Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.   That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex 
 Wasn't a fan of this book. I found that the caloric intake and the levels of fat were much too high for someone who is a casual athlete. If I'm Lance Armstrong and am training for hours every day, this diet makes sense. But as it is, I am a recreational triathlete who tries to keep her diet near 1500 calories to maintain my weight. More, I gain. Less, I bonk on workouts.   Secondly, I have to disagree with the people who found the recipes as being "too difficult". If anything, I was turned off by the lack of interesting recipes and the simplistic nature of the detail. Maybe some people need a lot of help in the kitchen. However, I don't like cookbooks that could be filled with more recipes instead filled with asinine directions such as "Take a noodle out of the water. Set it on a plate. Let it cool. Taste it. This is how you can tell if the pasta is done." You really can't dumb down the tough task of boiling water, throwing in pasta, and draining it, but Carmichael managed to. I really disliked this to the point where I just sort of glanced over recipes and prepared the ingredients listed in my own way 
 This movie is my favorite movie. Ever. I feel terrible giving it two stars. But it gets 2 stars because I am comparing it to the Rhino version, which I also own. I also own the original VHS. I have watched this movie at least once a year since I was 8 except for about 6 years in middle school/HS. I can sit in class and watch it from memory in my head.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION.  If you can't find the Rhino version, this isn't half bad. Its just that that version is much better, and since I have been growing up with older copies, the new one's flaws, minor to the newcomer, are blinding to me. I also am physically unable to watch any of the "Special Edition" Star Wars because of those changes, if that gives a clue to my movie anality.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT.  One complaint is that the VHS had this cool "glitter" effect in a couple of scenes involving energon and Unicron internals. It is present in the VHS, It came out wrong in the Rhino version, and was totally gone in the 20th. Thanks for deleting part of my childhood.  In comparison to the Rhino version:   The remaster is terrible. Mine seems to flicker and have strange artifacts. The colors are totally off. Hot Rod is basically magenta/pink instead of red and his orange is not orange like an orange, it is orange like a cheaply made basketball.  Widescreen is fake. It is a cut fullscreen. I wish you weren't such a liar, Sony.  Cover art: D-. No detail. Looks like whoever does the new show drew it in an afternoon or two. The matrix looks like a honeydew. It would have got an F but Prime is on there.  Very few of the extras were worth it. I bought this for the remaster, hoping for some clean up and a restoration of the glitter effect, and they weren't there 
 This book does not present any new information. Several books, notably Duncan's "The Dollar Crisis" does a much better job of explaining the fundamental dangers of a managed currency. This book adds smugness and some barely comprehensible jibes at the current American system for not being libertarian enough, but throughout the book there is barely a suggestion of a practical solution for any of the problems it describes. Duncan provides some pie in the sky solutions, (a global minimum wage), but at least he says something.  Wiggins' final advice is to buy gold. Hope I didn't spoil it for ya. The reason why you should amounts to, "because it was good enough for ancient Rome". There is VERY much repetition of the basic points, and many of the anecdotes don't support the point he makes in the same chapter. The entire chapter on John Law could have been explained in a sentence, and then he could have taken some time to tell us what we could do to avoid the temptation to inflate the currency! This is supposed to be a book about the coming of the reckoning day, but other than a timid assertion that the current bear market could last as long as 18 years, we don't even get a hint of what factors would have to combine to create the catastrophic financial conditions that the book's title seems to presuppose.  All in all worthless. Read Duncan 
 I've noticed my reviews are, for the most part, either 1 or 5 star reviews. Once again, I have encountered a product that cannot logically be given anything higher than 1 star. I rented Boa vs. Python expecting to witness the most juvenile and sophomoric movie ever. What I witnessed was the most juvenile and sophomoric movie ever, and it wasn't even fun to watch in some prehistoric level of my brain. It was painful and damaging, like trudging through infected syringes.   Okay, this is a total B movie. Plot holes are expected. (Like someone half-way opening the cage that's holding a giant snake to tranquilize it with a tiny pistol. Who could have ever expected a snakes' tail to fit through an enormous opening?) Bad special effects are expected. (The snakes seem to glow in dark, subterranean environments. Excellent.) Archetypical characters are expected. (Silent Indian guy with arrows? Check. Rambo guy with a flamethrower? Check. Nondescript female lead? Check.)  ... But this movie is a grand new level of DIRKA DIRKA. This is a film that promises two giant snakes fighting in a city, with exploding helicopters; as proudly displayed on the cover. What we have is a movie featuring a girl getting orally pleasured by a giant snake, a snake that later fights another giant snake in some dark tunnel for less than a minute. What the hell is this? It's not funny or the least bit entertaining. Recommended if you want to see how low the bar can go. - Thus says the Pellingto 
 i was verry disapointed to see this movie because i wanted to see the  real movie and not a musical movie. i'm still looking for the real real movie but still can't find it 
   The line up of 60's and 70's soulsters is interesting - an eclectic mixture of the well known and the not so famous. The backing orchestration and vocals are excellent. However, everything unravels when the lead vocals commence. The singers all sound as if there was a curtain between them and the microphone when the recordings were made.   It is not just a matter of 60 year old vocal chords being weaker than 20 year old. It is not the obvious lack of proper balance between the audience noise and the music.  The simple problem is that the vocals were not mixed at the correct volume. I can understand such a problem with a 1960 concert. This is a 2003 production!  I am perplexed 
 This book tries too hard to be meaningful, diverse, and deep. If Fleishman hadn't put so much emphasis on it, the book would have been much better 
 The pictures are great, but the explanations are lacking.  In doing faux finishes it is imperative to know what colors and types of paints to be used., this book did not offer too much of that.  Very disappointing. A waste of money 
 This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not.  The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best.  Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book.  It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius. 
 This CD is horrible. Don't buy this CD, you might think oh playboy mansion party COOL!, you're dead wrong, this cd is horrible, it might be good if you're on serious [intoxication], in which case you would love this CD it would feel like God rubbing your belly. I was thoroughly disappointed, amazon will probably filter out this this review because it is saying how horrible the item REALLY is, as opposed to those fake reviews they posted 
 if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.  liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.  sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.  repeat for 300 pages...   "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it 
 American Pie: an immature, mindless, vapid, boring, blandly disgusting, humor lacking piece of over-rated trash packed full of cliches, highschool sterotypes, annoying horny teenaged behavior performed by a wonderful cast of grade A douchebags. 
 I really liked Suzanne Summers. I've read all her other books and have her tai chi exercise video. When I saw her on the Today show advertising this book I couldn't wait to get it.  She promotes the Schwarzbein Principle which states that being a vegetarian is unhealthy. Suzanne has an entire chapter dedicated to someone named Wendy who after 10 years of being a vegetarian was convinced to start eating meat again! Just because Wendy's particular diet was unhealthy, that doesn't mean that all vegetarians are unhealthy. There are meat eaters that have unhealthy diets. Look at all the Hindus in India, they're lifetime vegetarians and are healthy.   I know that soy has been a controversial subject recently, but it's the pill form of soy that is questionable, soy it it's natural form is healthy for you. How can you say that soy is bad for you when millions of East Asians eat soy as part of their daily diet? I've read countless books and research that supports the benefits of soy.  I eat a balanced vegetarian diet and get all the nutrients my body needs.  Just because one doctor doesn't believe that a vegetarian diet is healthy, doesn't make it a fact. Suzanne you've really gone too far to tell everyone to stop being a vegetarian. With that misinformation in your book, I have a hard time believing that anything else is true and fact. 
 I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.  
 Georgette Heyer wrote so many wonderful books that I recommend you skip this one, unless you are trying to read the whole oeuvre or are a serious scholar of the progress of her writing style. It is set in medieval times (as is her unfinished and rarely read history, Lord John) and her gift for dialog and characterization seems to be lost beneath the weight of the armor.  If I remember right, according to her biography, The Private World of Georgette Heyer, this book was an early effort which she did not wish to be published. Instead, go on to one of her other novels. For mysteries, I recommend Blunt Instrument or Who Killed the Butler; for romances, any of the historical ones. And if you are new to Miss Heyer's work, you have many blissful hours ahead of you 
  ...as noted in other reviews here, hydrogen is simply an energy carrier (not a source) -- like a battery.   Here is an interesting quote:  " ...hydrogen offers little to no potential to produce oil security and reduce climate change risk in the next 20 years.  (Changing the infrastructure for using hydrogen fuel cells for transportation)  ...is a many decades undertaking.  Hydrogen fuel cells for transportation, are in my judgment, a snare and a delusion..."     -- James Woolsey, former CIA Director.  
 Not a surprise for this overrated, squeeky-painful-to-the-ear recording.  There are so many other Broadway musical recordings out there that people should check out 
 Sara Ivanhoe does an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating poses. She points out common mistakes and gives helpful advice on how to correct them. The twelve poses are a good foundation for a beginner doing yoga for the first time. It is worth watching - but only once.  The problem is that she spends over a minute between each pose talking about them. Rather than telling the viewer what to do as they are doing it, she demonstrates, talks, talks some more, then she tells you to begin (each pose is held for 6 breaths). I'd much rather that she explained things as she was doing them. Sure, then you may not get everything the first time, but at least the program would not drag on as it does.  The other thing I didn't like about this was the "boing" sound effects of the For Dummies tips. If I'm doing yoga to relax, I want to hear soothing music, not annoying popup sound effects.  If you have never done any yoga before, this may be worth renting to watch once. However, I would not recommend buying it. You won't care to watch it again 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 Great supporting characters do not always make great lead characters.  Joe Pike is a great supporting character, and one of the things that made him so is the sense of blank mystery he has in the earlier books by Robert Crais.  Demystifying him, as happens to an extent here, makes him less impressive and less interesting.  Elvis Cole, by contrast, is a better lead character than supporting character.  The inner monologue that gives him so much life when he was the center of the book is here absent, and so we trade a lead character for a supporting one, and vice versa, and are worse off for both trades 
 The kind of solutions this book gives are not aimed at someone like me, new and uncertain when it comes to linux. This is a dissapointment for me, as I have normally always been very pleased with O'Reilly books 
 I'm finding myself very upset that I didn't research Roy H. Williams further before reading his book. I thought I would get a non-partisan, non-religious, perspective of advertising but I received the total opposite. He is kind of creepy - you should check out his website... he runs some missionary out in Texas that caters to religious advertising fanatics. Williams sends out a "Monday Morning Memo" which I subscribed to until now, in which he said "I spent some time last week with Mark Sanford, Governor of South Carolina. I knew nothing about the man before we sat down together, but having gotten to know him, I've found myself hoping that he someday runs for president. - RHW" Sanford, obviously a Republican, is very anti-gay and very anti-abortion. Republicans and the Bush Administration are the ones firing up the FCC to crack down on those creatives trying to push edgey and non-traditional advertising! One of the reasons why Superbowl 2005 had terrible TV ads. People were too scared to do ANYTHING. You are better off reading "Hey Whipple, Squeeze This!" by Luke Sullivan. You will see my copy of "Wizard of Ads" posted on eBay even though I'm not done reading it. I don't intend to finish it. 
 If I could give this book zero stars I would.  This book came highly recommended as a great way to introduce Egyptian History to children.  I was stunned to read the book only to find it was horridly inaccurate!  While I realize this is supposed to be historical fiction, at least some attempt at historical accuracy should have been attempted.  Not every parent has an interest or knowledge of Egyptian History so many wouldn't notice, but since this book is reccomended by at least two homeschool curricula, and parents expect the authors of those curricula to have at least passing knowledge of the history they are teaching, I think fair warning is needed.    According to this book, Tutankhamen was the son of Amenhotep III.   Amenhotep III was actually Tutankhamen's grandfather.  Tutankhamen was the son of Amenhotep IV,  Akhenaten.  Not Amenhotep IV's younger brother as portrayed in the book.  Also, Akhenaten didn't die after a short time as Pharaoh, he ruled for at least 17 years.  About the only thing the book got correct was that Akhenaten did change the religion from poly-theism to mono-theism and that Egypt was returned to poly-theism after Tutankhamen became Pharaoh.  If you are looking to teach your children Egyptian History, and want accurate Egyptian History, skip this one.  
 It looks nice but the lid touches the top of the butter and sticks to it 
 The authors have maybe a bit too much expertise and experience to effectively write for "dummies" like myself.  Somehow after reading this, I had just as many questions as before.  Part of the problem is this book is way too comprehensive, covering such topics as sail-boarding.  I would rather have had more in depth explainations of the basics and more diagrams/illustrations 
   One of the posters on here claimed that this CD was as good as "Force Behind The Power" - and nothing could be further from the truth.  Diana's voice as we once knew it, is gone.  She sings mainly from her lower register now, and all of the power in her voice has disappeared.  She needs to give up her pride and get serious with a vocal coach, or just give it up altogether. The batch of songs on here don't make any kind of impression, with the exception of Marvin Gaye's "I Want You" - the only track that evokes the seductive spirit that Ross is known for.  I don't know how this project was put together, but I doubt Ross ever spent time in the studio with the musicians who play on the tracks.  A couple of the songs sound like they were recorded in the wrong key.  The only way this work will sell, will be if she pulls off a remarkable performance of one of the songs on one of her many personal appearances next week in TV Land.  I doubt the CD will even break into the 200 Album Chart.  Sorry D. 
 The prologue of this book is exquisite. The fallability of humans is delicately expressed though the use of origami-doctors and priests who build people. Unfortunately, the inventiveness of Plascencia grows beyond endearing as the chapters move on. It becomes unbearable. The story is lost in script-like repetition and hastily placed ink splotches. While Plascencia may have had good reason behind his innovation, creativity hits a reader like a bat to the head and leaves them with no time to contemplate who threw the bat or why the bad was thrown before they pass out and puke over their new shoes. 
 It turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife's ears.  I assume that the stems must not be white gold?  Other than that they are as expected.  Not perfect, but not bad for the price 
 I loved the concept of the book. I hated the presentation.  The book had too many characters, was wordy, and not even entertaining.   Jill Nelson should have hung out with some 40-something sistas to get the lingo right. She tried to hard to make them hype and they came off fake.  Fiction is not real but dang at least make it interesting.  I think Ms. Nelson should  stay with non-fiction and/or write about her generation and what they really are going through.  Lord have mercy this book gave me a headache.  
 This is the worst book of Shakespeare criticism I have ever read.  Bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next.  It reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly, handed to a graduate student, and entered into a computer over a weekend.  He contradicts himself several times.  I donated my copy to the library as soon as I was done reading it, so I cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur; but several times I recall reading a passage where Bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier.  To make matters worse, he even says the bard contradicts HIMself.  He points to supposed paradoxes regarding Hamlet's age, stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30.  Apparently the point is that if Shakespeare contradicts himself, so can Bloom.  Bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that Hamlet is a slacker.  He has not grown up yet.  That is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom.  Some of the book's observations are interesting, but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from Bloom's notes.  Interespersed between the passages scribbled down from Bloom's lectures are outbursts where Bloom reminds us that Shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer, in verse or prose, who ever lived.  Bloom is a great critic when he still tries, but in this book he was not even trying 
 This Book belabors the obvious and is very light on detail oriented, usable information.  General overview is good, but you can tell that this person does not have any hands on experience with the subject matter 
 What trash!  I'm glad I didn't buy it and browsed it in a store. In an article where the author was attending a party and obviously drinking too much, he put down Chihuahuas calling them rats and putting down cats too. He was apparently using this event that benefited resuce pets to push his ridiculous book.   If you don't like animals, which he doesn't seem to, he should maybe write about drinking.  He seems to know that best.  I would have given him a no star rating, but you have to give a least one star to leave a review.  
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 I've been reading this book as part of a Bible study. This book rubs me the wrong way in so many ways.        The sample prayers in the book are genuine and meaningful, and I think if prayed from the heart, God can bring meaningful change to a marriage realtionship. But the overall view of prayer in this book is so incomplete and shallow. Stormie presents prayer as a one sided dialog with God, in which we ask for something and wait for an answer.         No where is prayer defined as a dialog with God. For Stormie, prayer is simply standing in front of some sort of spiritual vending machine, pressing buttons and waiting for a item to drop down. There is nothing wrong with the prayers in the book, they are just so gimme-gimme-gimme in nature, they miss the whole point of knowing and standing in the presense of God. And while many prayers do involve asking God for something, they can be so much more. A book on prayer should communicate this to some degree.        Stormie presents a very well polished good submissive wife attitude throughout the entire book. I find many Christians have this attitude, and to varying degrees, many of these Christians actually demean one another as a result. To Stormie, and many other Christians, marriage is not truly a partnership or a relationship. Stormie says many people confuse the terms 'obey' and 'submit', and I agree with her, wholeheartedly. However, I would submit to you she is one of the confused people!         To her, and countless other Christians, a husband's leadership is simply taking all factors into account and making a decision. If a wife sees he is considering her feelings and desires in making his decision, as well as yielding to God's leading for his family, the wife should happily and willfully follow his leading, even if she disagrees with him. No encouragement to discuss the matter is given, Stormie does not suggest dialog between the husband and wife; the wife must simply follow. There is actually nothing wrong with a husband and wife agreeing to conduct their marriage like this, but I don't think there is a strong case for this type of marriage presented in the Bible.         Stormie uses so many stereotypes, I often feel like I'm reading 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'. Men having deep and soothing voices, her commentary about having a serious conversation with her husband while he was watching a baseball game, and in her discussion of moods, calling men simple and straightforward and women complicated. All these are sterotypes.        Stereotypes in general don't work to illustrate your point, because they have such a weak foundation. For example, I know many husbands who do not have deep voices. Many men have no interest in sports. For those who enjoy sports, if their wife was talking to them in the middle of the game, I know many men who would stop to listen, or at the very least clearly communicate to their wife that this isn't the best time for a serious discussion. And on the many moods of women and the simplicity of men, I know of cases where the exact opposite is true.        Stormie has her heart in the right place, but honestly, I think she misses the boat here. She is extremely superficial at times, rarely digging very deep into scriptural foundations for what she is writing. Also, I don't think she was the right person to write this book. She is a woman instructing men on how to pray for their wives. This formula makes as much sense as going to a unmarried man for maritial counselling.         I think many people gain the most from this book by considering their wives point of view and providing for them by praying for them. I think many husbands have probably never stopped to consider praying for their wives, and this book might really open up their eyes. In this respect, I suppose the book does accomplish what it sets out to do. If you are looking for depth, substance, and an accurate biblical foundation on which to build your marriage, this book probably won't hurt. But I would encourage you, don't let this be the only book you read on marriage 
 This release is boring. What passes for angst is mere whining. Any hooks are few and far between. If a melody should occur, it's telegraphed well in advance by the guitars. It's sort of a musical equivalent of a dying lawn mower - there's a lot of racket but it can't cut it. Sixteen Stone is just what we didn't need more of in the mid-90s: One dimensional primitive blockhead raving. Makes a great coaster, though 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 Quite frankly, this was just not my type of book.  I definitely feel compassion for Bauby.  I think it is absolutely amazing he was able to dictate a book in this condition.  I am not familiar with "locked in syndrome" and I admire Bauby for his determination under these dire circumstances.  However, I am not a big fan of a book where the focus is more on metaphors and writing style.  I think it takes away from the emotion that can be projected to the reader.  It is a possibility Bauby hid behind the words and phrases and I do not blame him for this.  This book just wasn't able to leave that big of an impression on me.  I feel bad about that but not guilty. 
 Beware...this is NOT a book which will help you change your life.  This is a story about a man who's life changed drastically for the better.  Oh, would you like to know HOW?....well, cough up an extra $189 dollars and the secrets will be revealed to you.  This is not an interesting autobiography either, thinking he was leading to something big and reveavling later on in the book, I forgave him for all the disonnected prattle in the first half.  It dawned on me as I got three-quarters through the book that nothing was going to be taught to me, not now, not unless I paid extra to order the course. I don't know how this helped all the other readers who gave this 5 stars.  I am assuming that they bought the course, otherwise believe me, there is NO WAY your life will change by merely reading this book.  I felt cheated. But what a great marketing technique: you get people to buy a book which then gets them to buy a more expensive course! They have to, otherwise they are left hanging on a string. I definitely wouldn't have bought this book if I had known it was about someone merely telling us his life has changed.  I hear that so often from the countless recently-converted fanatics who knock on my door armed with all sorts of religious paraphernalia.  Having said that, I am sorely tempted to buy the course in order to satisfy my curiosity.  I feel like a lover, enticed and aroused, who upon approaching the zentih of passion is dumped aside with a "Not today, maybe next time, darling" excuse.  Aaaah...but today would have been so nice for me and not unless I buy the course I will never know what secret pleasures await me and neither will you.   
 Somehow, author Ted Yeatman has made Jesse and Frank James boring.  One has to admire the depth and breadth of his research into the lives of the notorious Missouri outlaws, but what was desperately needed here was a co-author who knew how to tell a good story.  One bank or train robbery sounds pretty much like all the others in Yeatman's plodding account, and I could not keep the brothers' numerous gang members straight -- the author does nothing to make them come alive as individuals.  The appendices and bibliographical notes are rather awe-inspiring -- Yeatman has done his homework, and then some -- but getting through this book is a hard slog 
 I was really excited to receive this book... however, I've had a difficult time enjoying reading it.  The run-on sentences, poor grammer, and loose sentence structure are so distracting, that as a reader, you loose interest.  I spent more time editing in my mind, then pulling together what the author was saying.  Rather long-winded, I kept having the feeling of "let's get to the point."  On a positive note, there are some fun pictures and the author does string together some interesting concepts.  Personally, I just couldn't get past the writing.  Summary - although interesting, don't expect concise writing 
 Woods has produced a silly anti-history of the U.S. in the hopes of generating a little revenue by finding a spot on the lunatic right-wing fringe bookshelf. Among things you will learn: The Whites treated Indians just fine and talks of exploitation are overblown. Blacks in the South were a contented lot, and the whole system was ruined by racists like Abraham Lincoln and the later Radical Republicans. Woodrow Wilson led the U.S. into World War One despite America's resistance to doing so. No mention of Teddy Roosevelt and the " Preparedness " movement. Also no mention that it was Congress that overwhelmingly approved the war declaration. And wouldn't you know it? In post World War II, blacks were knocking down the walls of segregation in an avalanche, and there was no need for federal intrusion, M.L. King, or even a Civil Rights or Voting act.  Woods even briefly makes a foray into sports to show how segregation was crumbling, since Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color barrier in 1947. He neglects to include that it took more than 10 more years to have all the rest of the teams come aboard; and furthermore, neglects discussion of persistent racism in other sports. Amazingly, the author has a Ph.D. in History from Columbia! How? It had to be on some government sponsored program that he detests. This is straight out of the Anne Coulter/Michelle Malkin school of history: heavy on mudslinging; infantile with the wrting and history. 
 I got this book thinking it would help with animation principles and some technical aspects, but it gleans over everything so quickly that the whole thing is useless. For example the chapter on Web Animation is about 4 pages long and covers Animated Gifs- Yeah, because what I really wanted to learn was how to make a looping picture of a clown on a ball. It also touches upon Flash, but its only given a 2 page spread and the only info it gives is "Flash is good for web animation!" This book has nice coulor photographs, but the only information it gives is stuff you probably already know like you need a camera for stop motion and that you should figure out what your cartoon will be about before making it. Oh, and apparently Angelina Anaconda is the end-all be-all of animation 
 The author admittedly started this project as part of his masters or doctoral thesis and that's just how the story is presented.  Let's just say it's not an easy read.  His words do not flow smoothly.  The title of the book is also a bit misleading.  While the book does begin with a general overview of the history of Native Americans and the wrongs inflicted on them by Europeans ... the rest of the book then takes a DEEP dive into New Mexico and Oklahoma.  The title of the book should more accurately reflect a deep focus on Soutwestern Indians, as that is the primary subject of the book.  Bottom line, it is clearly an extremely well researched book, but a poorly written book.  Much like sitting down on a Sunday and reading Case Law transcripts.  The beginning chapter gives an interesting insight into the events that shaped the laws governing Indian Gaming, but unless you're interested in the minutia of New Mexico or Oklahoma, then the rest of book is pretty much a sleeper.  I wouldn't recommend buying it 
 I recently found this two-pack in a bargain bin for five bucks, Being a Lucy fan I snatched it up and brought it home. Well all I can say is that I'm glad I only paid five bucks for it. On the up side the shows are highly entertaining and they highlight an era in television that rarely receives it's due, But on the down side the tranfer looks like it's been pooped on and at times all you see is a white screen with an outline of Lucy. But the shows almost make this DVD a good value, bottom line! BUY IT FOR FIVE BUCKS. Any higher it's a bad value 
 Nathalie Dupree is an adoptive Southerner -- she was born in New Jersey. Now there's nothing wrong with that; we welcome everyone down here, but she is not Southern and she is decidedly not "country folk." Anyone with a certificate from Cordon Bleu who owned a restaurant in Social Circle, GA, is not Daisy Duke.  I don't know how Ms. Dupree came by her vaunted reputation. When I watched her PBS series in 1986, I could not believe what a mess she made of her kitchen. Dirt and grit from leeks flew like gnats, landing on the countertops and the floor. The cake batter she accidentally poured through the handles of a Dutch oven spilled all over the counter. While making a half-hearted effort at cleaning it up, she said to the camera, "I'm sure you'll do better when you make it at home." Ya think?  The grits roll which sounds so good, and which Ms. Dupree claims won somebody $6000 in a cooking contest, does not work. ALL chess pies are made with a little cornmeal -- she seems stunned that her friend's recipe calls for it. OK, so the ham biscuits work, and are tasty. The homemade applesauce is very good. But two decent recipes out of 200 is nothing to brag about.  I was born and raised in North Carolina, and have lived here all my life. I thought it was just me, but over the past 20 years I've made a point of asking practically every Southerner I meet this question, and we all agree: NO ONE eats chicken gravy on cantaloupe. I have no idea where that came from.  A bright, fledging cook of 12 or 13 can tell you that if you throw the butter, flour and milk in a saucepan all at the same time and start whisking, you are not going to get a cream sauce. Most good home cooks can tell you that you cannot freeze a chicken dish made with cucumbers.  I could go on, except I haven't gotten to why I think Ms. Dupree is a snob. There are numerous recipes in this book which she prefaces by saying, "this recipe is from my dear friend/former student/cooking teacher... it's *wonderful,* but here's *my* version." There's even a recipe called "Puff Pastry MY WAY." P.S. It's no better than puff pastry made anybody else's way.   I'm glad I didn't spend any money on my copy; it was a gift. I'll stick with my files of my grandmothers' recipes, Mrs. Dull's 1928 "Southern Cooking" and the 1950 "Southern Cookbook" from the UNC Press 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 Although well enough written it failed to address the importance of the Black Sea to Eurasian mytho-history as well as it might have.  By skittering from period to period it left this reader wanting more about the essential place of the sea.  An analytical approach would have been more effective.  And by relegating only a small space to the creation of the Black Sea at the end of the last Ice Age and its place in the Flood myths that grew up around this the book failed to really place it ideologically.    Not a bad book but overall disappointing for this reader.    However, I would recommend this book as a fair introduction to the Black Sea and its history...but I was hoping for a more perceptive read.   
 My thoughts about this book can be summed up by a quote by Lanfear herself:  "you don't use one tenth of your potential".  The most frustrating element of this book (and the series as a whole, for that matter) is the wasted potential.  The world of this series was so vividly realized and the plot was complex and engaging.  Now, it is difficult not to sit back and wonder where exactly Jordan went off track.  Most other reviewers commented on the fact that all the characters did not "miraculously" end up in the same place for the last battle.  Personally, I found it very disapointing.  Three of the four plot lines are resolved satisfactorally (even the Nynaeve/Elaine one...though I will admit it wrapped up too neatly and had me hoping at the end that the Black Ajah would come back at the last minute and wipe the self satisfied smile off Nynaeve's face).  Even so, I was left wondering whether the weeks I'd spent reading this book were worth it.    What this book lacked most was direction.  It was very much a filler book for the characters/readers to take a breather in between major plot movements (at least I think that was what the original idea was).  Readers can debate about whether the book was a success or not until they turn blue in the face (as I know they will) but for me, the book (and the series a sa whole) has fallen very flat 
 This is one of the few books I have bought over the years that I wish I hadn't wasted my money on. I thought the story was kitschy and trite, as well as badly written. As a dog owner she demonstrated quite a degree of ignorance, naivity, and recklessness, and I think the new age twist to the story was just pathetic. All in all, I don't get why anyone found this worth publishing. 
     That phrase is the title of a review of the book that was published by Jerry Coyne in *The New Republic,* August '05. Coyne has good claim to know something about the subject; he's Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. The review is lengthy--longer by far than any review here could be--and it's scathing. I urge anyone who's suspicious of the many negative reviews that appear here to read it. By all means read *Pandas* too-- but read it to see just how shoddy a book can be. It's hard to understand how anybody could take such stuff seriously, let alone try to force it on ninth graders as a tex 
 although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead 
 We rented this movie, knowing it wouldn't be an Oscar winner or anything. I've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books, but this took the cake. It was so lame! We thought it would at least be entertaining...no luck there. The best part about it was when it ended. What a relief! 
 This attack on soap opera attempts to tell the readers that soap opera,  like other forms of popular entertainment, glorifies the role of the father  and brainwashes its viewers to be submissive to patriarchal imperitives   However, the theory in this book simply panders to the most narrow-minded  of extremist feminists.  The theory does not fit the facts.  Soap opera is  one of the major popular entertainments that permits critical questions  about the excesses of the father's prerogatives to surface.  By discussing  small fragments of soap opera story arcs as if they were the whole thing,  this book distorts its subject and renders a major disservice to its  reader 
 Hateful liberals once again undermine their so-called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the US population. They claim to be tolerant and open-minded toward all lifestyles,religions, races etc... but that open-mindedness obviously shouldn't apply to people who disagree with them. Throughout the "book," Moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people. If you like this book, I also recommend Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Both "books" are jam-packed full of hate. 
 Adler must be given his due for making philosophy more accessible to the average, non-professional reader. He deliberately tackles six classical ideas and gives reasons for their importance. For the non-specialist, these six essays may provoke interesting discussion and dialectic, or perhaps starting points for further inquiry.  Such topics as beauty, truth, justice, etc. often have been lost in philosophy for the narrower, Anglo-American analysis of propositional logic. That doesn't means Adler's ideas are useless or less interesting, but they aren't the type of topics one encounters in most academic philosophy departments, for good or ill.  Of all Adler's books, this is far my least favorite. It concerns itself with essences, something that has given way to Wittgenstein's "family of resemblances." Talking about "essences" is antediluvian, unless, like Adler, you're an Aristotlean. Reading about such abstract concepts -- the six great ideas, is rather like talking about "red" with someone. There's not much one can really do or say about "red," except to point out examples. I'm afraid that Adler has boxed himself into a corner by pursuing such absract concepts like "liberty" as if it were any different than "red."  It's not that I oppose Adler's good intentions; I really wish his kind of philosophy was more visible, tackling some of these important concepts in an intellectually rigorous manner. But ambiguity raises its ugly head, and the student of philosophy is left bereft of very important philosophical concepts.   Tackling enormous concepts without intellectual rigor seems rather useless and pointless. Thus, two stars for effort, but really no stars for success. Yet, if one really wants a place to start his or her inquiry, this little book may be of singular importance 
 There is a point, late in this book, when "a spiritually dumb culture" is exemplified by an American businessman who has "absorbed goals that make no sense just because he learned them at  Harvard."  This seems to assume that great minds have always been  gluttons for things that make no sense.  Part of getting a great education  was being exposed to some variety, though that ideal tends to overstate the  amount by which any American has ever shown any sign of benefiting from any  kind of education, however in tune the assigned reading may have been with  being "set for a coronary at fifty-five" so he can "die  feeling that he never achieved his goals."  (p. 283).  On a personal  level, I would just like to add that part of the fun of observing the  operation of a great enterprise like Harvard was in suspecting that such  things were genuinely dubious, and a real individual would derive more  pleasure in being able to say that having a mind that has been criticized  at Harvard for having perverse reasons for being there (inappropriate  laughter being worse there than anywhere) is not as pleasing as receiving a  rejection letter from their alumni rag (Harvard Magazine) written by an  editor who clearly felt that an article examining the question, "Is MY  VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK an ascetic ideal?" would be puzzling for most of  the readers of that magazine.  People who think that Harvard can't have it  both ways on a question like that don't know Harvard 
 I am a huge fan of Ms Morrison. IMO she should have won a Pulitzer for "The Bluest Eye". But I find her increasingly difficult to understand. Beginning with "Beloved", Ms. Morrison novels have taken on a mystical quality that bewilder and confuse me. Often I have to go back and re-read pages to find out which character is speaking or remembering or dreaming or what. I gave up on this one somewhere in the middle. I am now plowing through "Love" in which she uses the same tactic and it's a guessing game. I really wish she would return to her earlier style as exhibited in "The Bluest Eye", "Sula" and "Song of Solomon".  
 As already stated by R. Henry, this book was basically taken, without permission, from the original website www.shawlministry.com. I am highly disappointed and will not purchase from Lion Brand or Leisure Arts in the future.  Nor will I buy this book.  They could have at least given credit where credit is due! The book entitled "Knitting into the Mystery: A Guide to the Shawl-Knitting Ministry" DOES give credit and includes the web address www.shawlministry.com.  Hmmm, Lion and Leisure's book includes prayers? Did they copy those from "Knitting into the Mystery"? :( The shawl ministry website is worth visiting and where you can learn all about the shawl ministry and get basic patterns for free. Shame on you Lion Brand and Leisure Arts, for commercializing and making profits off of a charitable ministry 
 Outdated facts, arbitrary topics, and a false populist tone fill this careless guide. Have the authors read any scientific or medical journal published after the Victorian age 
 "The Having of Wonderful Ideas", by Eleanor Duckworth, was not quite what I expected.  Although I learned from some aspects of the book I expected more"ideas" that could be easily understood and incoporated into classroom activities.  I felt that the essays on the many experiments conducted by the author and Piaget were far too lengthy, almost drowning out any real "wonderful ideas".  This book is not easy to read, and may leave the reader struggling to read to the end. However, as I stated previously I did learn a few things, but they came too far and few between the lengthy essays 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 I agree with that reviewer from Nashville. This book was quite disappointing. I thought i'd learn in detail how to create animation in Flash. DID NOT HAPPEN. I bought an animation book along with this one as a supplement sort of. Now I'm glad I bought the extra book, so I don't feel like my purchase and weeks of waiting were totally in vain 
 Easum and Bandy make excellent points regarding the difficulties of traditional churches.  Who can argue with the reality of decline; the substitution for institutional maintenance for evangelism?  Unfortunately their response to the challenge is gimmicky and shallow.  For example, they envision "worship" consisting of chats with a holographic Jesus and Mary on the challenges of family life.  Is such a retreat into entertainment the only way to reach today's generation?  Is it even possible for such entertainment to be authentic worship, or have we settled for a Disneyland version of reality?  The authors don't consider such questions, nor do they address the question of resources, envisioning the megachurch, with its wealth, to be the only option for the future.  Current trends indicate the future is not quite so monolithic.  There are other books tackling these issues with far more practical advice 
 I have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends, a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week. A neighbour suggested the Mr Clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she didn't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub.  I am disappointed with it. The one thing I did like was the pole. I was able to scrub the tub, the tile on the walls without needing to overreach. That said, I really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub, and still couldn't get it all until I used my regular scrub brush. I think I was expecting this to be a way that I could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so. The other thing that bothered me was that you have to RINSE off the stuff after you scrub; from watching the commercial I feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you're done. At least it wasn't that spendy so I don't feel too bad about the wasted money 
 I should have known better than ordering another worthless guitar instruction book. I have been trying to learn how to play the guitar for over 50 years now and I have yet to find an instruction book that tells you how really to play more than simple chords and strumming. I have stacks of such books that have not helped me at all. It seems to me that there in a conspiracy to try to keep people from learning what all the great guitar players know. Even the private instructors keep you taking lessons for years without really teaching you anything of value. When I learned to play wind instruments the lessons were concise and they followed a definate pattern to help you achieve a high level of ability. All the guitar books I've seen so far start somewhere in the middle and go nowhere. It is my firm belief that a person is born to be a real, all around, good guitar player and if he isn't there is very little anyone can do to teach you. 
 I bought this fan mainly due to the positive reviews here.  However, I decided to return the fan for refund on the very first day it arrived because it doesn't push as much air as it was claimed by other reviewers here.  I like its look but a fan must at least achieve its primary objective which is to cool the room; I don't think this fan achieves this objective at all 
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 I have worked in the 'Osteoarchaeology' field for nearly 10 years and I when I bought this book I did not expect to be reading a novel type book. Books like this are dramatised on frequently watched cable/network tv - I live in Ireland! I have used other books by the author and found them invaluable, but not this.....an ok read but dreadful reference material 
 I read this book early in my own infertility journey. Unfortunately, all this book did for me was SCARE the living daylights out of me. The author encountered some of the "worst-case" scenarios that we all know exist: extreme adverse reaction to Clomid, ectopic pregnancy, etc. Rather than serve as a practical guide to the day-to-day drone of infertility, the book dealt in worst-case scenarios.  [...] the ultimate insult comes at the conclusion of the book when the author implies that you can "just relax" and get pregnant. All of us dealing with infertility have certainly been given that "advice" by all of our ignorant acquaintances and families already... which led us to look for books to help us cope. Shame on the author for compounding the insult. 
 I like funny. I enjoy reading humor.  Always have and will.  All kinds of humor. Whenever and wherever I can find it. I think its important to start the day with a laugh.  Even if its from my morning ritual on the weight scale. I got this book based on primarily the reviews of it.  I tried to look at it at the bookstore but it was wrapped in that plastic you-wanna-look-you-gotta-buy wrap that some books come in. So I shelled out the ten bucks hoping to "pee my pants", "Laugh so hard I had to buy several copies" or "when I need a laugh I pick this book up". I got my book and after ripping off the plastic wrap the first thing I realized is that I just paid about 6 bits a page for the thing. I liked the illustrations, a lot.  I liked the humor.  Did I buy several copies? No.  Did I laugh hard.  Hardly. Did I pee my pants. Only because the bathroom door was locked from the inside by mistake that day. It was not that funny to me.   I was pretty much done with it and donated it to the library after an hour.  They put it in with the kids picture books.   If you want to get a really good laugh.  Read Pat McManus, Richard Amour and Christopher Moore.  If this book makes you laugh, more power to you and spread it around. We need more laughter these days. The Library spread mine back to me and it sits on a shelf. Apparently a couple of parents thought this was a book that developing readers should start with. I can only imagine the look in their eyes when their 4-year old pointed into the book, looked up questionably and asked "what's that word mean?". So I guess this book did make me laugh to some extent. 
 These movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies.  From a horror movie fan's perspective, I remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original, "It's Alive".  The only thing about babies (mutated or not) that scares me is having to change their diapers...it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too!  What a worthless...waste 
 It's a waste of money. They look so cheap and very bad quality. This must be worth like a dollar or less mass produced. 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 The book delivers the promise on the dust jacket, of showing the Jesus who is not political or "religious" in any conventional sense. It's nice to read Jesus words anyplace, in the Bible or elsewhere.  But, Wills betrays his Catholic upbringing on many pages. He finds no mention of priests, bishops, or popes in the New Testament, nor does he show any respect for any other form of organized Christian religion.   He doesn't give the Catholic Church the credibility to rub two nickels together, much less to canonize the works of the Bible itself. Wills shows so much contempt for organized Christianity, as being unfaithful to Jesus. He ends up sounding to me as if he's criticizing Jesus for failing to lay down a plan for spreading the gospel. If it was not via an organized church, then what does Wills think Jesus meant 
 The author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment.   Though the author's real target is US society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. And of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. A country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. But it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the US.   In the US, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. In actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. In this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. He contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. It is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at Wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. The actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the Wal-mart juggernaut.   He especially decries direct citizen actions. He is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. However, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. It's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of Congress to accumulate vast sums. If citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. The theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as American as apple pie. His view that such unelected bodies as the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve Board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. Who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the Fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? No, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it.   If the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. First and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. It is not surprising that Americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. The list could go on. Informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. The US most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. This is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore.   It is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. Americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. Yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. The book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.  
 My kids really liked it until it broke the next day. There was nothing we could do to fix it as it had an electronic problem 
 This book is comparable to the dozens of others written by extremists on both ends of the political spectrum.  Do these guys really think America is this stupid 
 even bronson looks tired in this sad action movie! why they made this waste of time and money is beyond me. not even so bad it's good,just bad 
 Yes, this book was a present from my father in law. He knew about my interest in digital photography and bought this book in Japan for me.   What to say about this book..hmmm..each time I look at its size and compare it with the shallowness of its contents it makes my blood boil. Seems Mr. Rick Sammons wants to keep the real knowledge to himself and dish out only a small fraction of it to the readers.  I have learned much more from the internet and from second hand magazines than from this hefty book. His constant reference to plugins ticks one off as it seems he never wants the reader to know about photoshop's potential and the effects the program can create itself (don't know how much he was paid by nik color efex..his favorite plugin) A hobbyist would love to know how to make fabulous images and not what Professional photographers have shot, about rules of composition (not just rule of the 3rds), exposure, 18% gray, how different colors in nature can assist you take a guess about the correct exposure if u donot have a grey card, how u can use the palm of your hand to take a meter reading, the use of manual mode for night photography, etc. All such vital information was either not given the required emphasis or was avoided completely by Mr. Sammons.   This book is a waste of money. Though my father in law paid for it, I still feel sad. If only I knew what he was buying and what the book was like, I would have advised him otherwis 
 A former British Intelligence officer, Lewis was one of those postwar travel writers whose books sold like gangbusters but have since largely faded into obscurity. Having recently traveled to Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, and being a fan of the travelogue genre, I thought this might be a fitting introduction to his work. Originally published in 1951, the book documents his trip of the previous year to French Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) -- an era when the French colonial rule was in decline and the Viet Minh had already taken up arms to drive them out. The majority of the book is spent in Vietnam, although certain spots on the modern tourist routes are given their due, such as Siem Reap (Angkor) and Luang Prabang.  Lewis writes clean, crisp, one might say "British" prose, which is easily digested -- so much so, in fact, that it takes a while to realize that the book is actually quite boring. His trip is somewhat of a litany of banal travel clichés: descriptions of bad roads, worse bus drivers, decrepit vehicles, inscrutable natives, "exotic" food, and so forth. Despite his evident interest in various small rural tribes, he doesn't seem to know very much about them, and thus, isn't able to tell the reader much of anything useful about them either. The most interesting parts of the book are his interactions with other Westerners, especially the missionaries, plantation lords, and various French civil and military administrators who are eager to show him around.  The missionaries and plantation bosses come in for pretty heavy scorn from Lewis, and anyone interested in the roots of the Vietnam War would be well advised to read the chapter where Lewis witnesses firsthand how the French system in Vietnam operated along feudal relationships of power and local villagers were forced to labor on plantations. Alas, there's also plenty of scorn (albeit less direct) for the natives of the places he visits. There are no end of terms such as "squalid", "barbaric", "indolent", "immoral", "sinful" and the like applied to various tribespeople along the way. The levels of condescension are rather disappointing from someone eulogized by the Telegraph after his death as "perhaps the best, and certainly the most underrated, English travel writer of the 20th century."This is the book that allegedly inspired Graham Greene to go to Vietnam and then produce The Quiet American, but most contemporary readers will find Greene's book to be far more engaging than this dated work. 
 The notion of "interpretive communities" is at best derivative of Kuhn's classical work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and at worst a framework of obstruction employed against those who wish to revivify literary theory and criticism in the wake of postmodern hegemony 
 There were many accurate accounts but I did not enjoy the way they portrayed Grat, nor the way they made light of may situations, also the supporting music was corny (comic) 
 Analyze That reunites the main cast from Analyze This and opens with Paul Vitti (De Niro) in prison and he wants out. What's he do to get out? Fakes insanity of course. How's he do that? By singing West Side Story songs. No, I'm not kidding. And the movie just gets worse from there. Vitti is placed into the caring hands of his old pal Dr. Sobel (Billy Crystal) and laughs are nowhere to be found.  I honestly think I only laughed once during the whole 96 minutes that actually felt more like 179 minutes. There's a small scene where Vitti is trying to take on normal jobs, but his mafia mindset causes a few chuckles. That's about all that's funny in this disaster. A good subtitle for the movie would be "Cashin' the Paycheck". That's all everyone seems to be doing in the flick. Everyone just seems so miserable, and with that cloud hanging over things laughter can't develop. A comedy without laugher is a total failure, and if it were for those extremely rare moments in this flick there it is possible to dig up something funny, Analyze That would be a failure.   In the end, it's a sequel to a simply average comedy that lacks any of the sparks or intelligence that kept the original from total despair. 
   Pushing the envelope for explicit, over the counter home videos, 9 SONGS (Tartan) is about one year of sex and rock'n roll in the life of two lovers.    Matt is a young glaciologist.  He meets Lisa at a London rock concert.  That night they start an affair.  In between attending more concerts, they make passionate love.  It's for real and explicit.  Nine live-concert song footage is intercut with their coke-snorting, sexual encounters creating a sometimes ironic reflection of their intense physical but otherwise rather bland relationship.  And finally, all this takes place in the memory of Matt as he flies across the vast frozen wastelands of the South Pole.    This unscripted film is part musical, part drama, part documentary and part performance.  It raises questions about the difference between pornography and art. Controversial and much buzzed about, this not fully satisfying experiment is of interest mainly as a novelty item by a usually innovative and creative director for what it could have been.  And of course the sex.  A special feature eliminates everything but the concert performances. 
 When I read Michael Cunningham's A Home at the End of the World, I was so dazzled by his prose that I found myself stopping again and again to reread and admire his sentences. In The Hours, he combined the same stylistic virtuosity (paragraph after paragraph imitating Virginia Woolf's style, for example) with a novelistic structure that took three separate narratives set in different times and slowly wound them together to devastating effect. Specimen Days also presents three linked narratives, but everything that we admired about Cunningham's earlier books is missing here. The prose is utterly pedestrian, the plotting ranges from the unlikely to the preposterous, and the links between the three narratives are disappointingly mechanical and superficial.  The three narratives of Specimen Days are set in New York in different eras--the late nineteenth century, the present, and some time a century or so from now. To be fair, there's a thematic connection between them: in each case, one character sacrifices everything for the good of another character whom he or she knows only superficially. But the sad difference between Specimen Days and The Hours is this: in The Hours the three narratives merge to create something larger than each one is by itself, but in Specimen Days the three stories, presented sequentially, fail to illuminate--or even to relate to--one another. Instead, they're connected merely by a quirk (in each, there's a character who recites lines from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass), a prop (a white porcelain bowl), and the characters' similar names. One thinks longingly of the subtly with which Cunningham evolved the stories in The Hours and wonders what went wrong here.  Each of the stories in Specimen Days is more improbable than the last. The most successful is the first, about a boy who gives up everything to save another character from a disaster he only imagines and ends up saving her from an actual unimagined real disaster. (Since this story is the one most worth reading, I won't give away more of the plot.)  In the second story, a police hotline operator/psychologist unaccountably walks away from her career and her boyfriend to go on the lam with a child bomber whom the police are seeking and who, she thinks, will eventually kill her anyway. Sure. The third story is set in a United States that has been visited by a new species (think large versions of the Geico gecko, but without the engaging British accent) and that has been largely laid waste by some kind of unspecified nuclear or ecological disaster. The story has to do with a lizard character who helps a near-human android get from New York to Denver so that the android can contact his creator. The android suffers from an inability to experience human emotions, but through a turn of events when they reach Denver, he discovers that he can experience beauty and compassion like a full human being after all. "It seems I did a better job with you than I'd realized," says the android maker approvingly. That's right: think Star Trek's Mr. Data meets the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. How amazing, how disappointing, that such derivative dreck is coming from the pen of Michael Cunningham.   
 First, I would like to make clear, or to put it more aptly, this book was written by an academic and not someone who is in the actual business. In other words, lots of theory but nothing practical to back it up. If I'm not mistaken, the author has never, ever actually written a screenplay and have it produced. Those are strikes one and two against this book. Strike three is that, yes there is some valuable information contained between the covers but it's SO disjointed, you have to constantly go back and forth throughout it in order to try to make any sense out it. My advice? Buy something written by people who ARE in the movie business and NOT from the "Joe College" types who live off of tenure so they really don't have to prove anything to anyone. It's one thing to talk about writing and quite another to sell something for a six figure amount to a production company 
 Sure there's some excellent artwork in this picture book. But instead of being an artistic guide to the ships of the Star Trek universe, 'Ships Of The Line' ends up being more like a photo album (albeit artist-rendered) of the central ship of each of the Star Trek television series. This is not anything close to a comprehensive spotter's book for the various Federation and alien space craft like the book's dust jacket suggests, which is EXACTLY the sort of book a Trekkie geek like me was expecting. Instead, this book lays out like a scrap book of the various iterations of U.S.S. Enterprises as it appeared on the various series and in film, the Defiant from DS9 and of course Voyager. Too few of the art panels focus on other ships in the Star Fleet inventory, or from any of the alien races that makes the Star Trek shows as rich and embellished as they were.  Too small to be a real coffee table book, and too lacking in the sort of minutiae information a Trek trivia fan craves to be useful as a real Star Trek reference guide, 'Ships Of The Line' needs to head back to the literary version of space dry dock for a content refit 
 I bought 2 mintek dvd players because I got such a "great" deal at kohl's department store.  I ended up getting each one for about $150, which was a great price compared to the original price. Within the first 3 months I had the same spinning of the disk and "no disk" message come up when there was a disk in it.  I immediately returned the one to Kohl's.  I kept the other one, to my dismay.  I had a hunch I should of returned it.  Sure enough, after the 90 day warranty, it began having the EXACT same problems, definitely a MINTEK problem.  I have emailed, made phone calls..several times with absolutely no human contact or response.  This company needs to be reported because they sell JUNK and back it up with absolutely NOTHING.   I figured I was already out a bunch of money, I just wanted to get it fixed so it was usuable...Can't reach anyone to do that.  There is a reason you can't find anyone...they know their products are WORTHLESS!!!. DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM MINTEK ..WORST MISTAKE YOU WILL EVER MAKE..AND TAKE A LOT OF YOUR MONEY WITH IT... 
 Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me 
 JoJo has some talent,but whoever is handling her career isn't going about things in the right way. these songs sound like a dime a dozen. a bit Christina here a bit Beyonce there, basically lets play name that tune&Vocal run. JoJo wants to be mentioned as a Artist with R&B roots,but thus far her music comes across like generic attempts at trying to hybrid R&B. if JoJo ever aspires to be the Teena Marie of her Generation than she will need the right Producer&also get some real songwriting as to the fast food vibe that is felt on alot of these tracks 
 Excellent resource for those desiring to know how to create really beautiful jackets for men or women.  Completely replaces pattern instructions purchased with the envelope 
 This book did not match my expectations. It is fun to flip through and look at some of the images, but most of the photos are not very well done, too cluttered with everything, but the cats. The layout of the book is too cluttered, confusing too. That said, there are a few very nice shots and overall it's a fun book, but i still put it down with a bad taste in my mouth. If you're looking for cool pictures of animals in nice pet-friendly surroundings, but "Animal House Style" by Julia Szabo. It's a so much better book 
 This CD came out in 1991, after The Fixx took a three year break.  It has 12 songs and is 52 minutes long.    Everyone has their own musical tastes.  Other people below rave about this CD.  I think it is the worst by the The Fixx.  One reviewer says that the first 5 songs are the greatest songs ever.  I think that 4 of the first 5 songs are the worst The Fixx has ever done.  I feel there are only 4 songs of any value on this CD and they are at the end of the CD.  The Fixx were a very popular and very typical New Wave band of the eighties, with short, catchy songs.  The band went into hibernation for three years, and when they came out in 1991, New Wave was dead.  But, that shouldn't matter, as long as The Fixx made a good CD, but they didn't.  On this CD, The Fixx try to incorporate their sound with other styles.  The first half of this CD is more like the New Wave Pop of the eighties, sounding like something Duran, Duran might do, but not as good.  Other tracks sound like they are trying to copy David Bowie.  Another track sounds like INXS.    The tracks I do like on this album are more along the lines of the traditional Fixx sound (except for Shut It Up, that sounds like the INXS copy).  The other good tracks are:  Yesterday, Today, One Jungle and Make No Plans (which might be one of the Fixx's best songs of all time).    I have nothing against bands experimenting and trying new things.  But, they must have a vision, instead of just trying to copy the successful forma of others.  After this CD, the Fixx died, but then made a comeback in 1998 
 The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves.  Once again, a formerly evil American U.S. Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U.S. imperialism.  At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe.    Actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right.  The samurai preyed on the peasants.  Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed.  When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges. the national army defeated them.    The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history.  Avoid it like the plague.   
 Instead of a testament to his climbing expeditions, this book might best serve as a testament to what seems to be Jim Wickwire's blatant misogyny and egocentrism.  After detailing how he decided his wife should leave college to support him, Wickwire regales us semi-boastfully with anecdotes relating how he expected his wife to be nothing more than a housekeeper, child-rearer, and "sex object" (his words).  After insisting on a large family, and getting offended at a well-meaning priest who gently suggested birth control, Wickwire  (by his own admission) proceeds to by-and-large shirk his duties as a father to all five of his children, supporting them only in the economic sense.    We then get to read his thoughts about the innate subordinism of female climbers, and their tendency toward sexual hijinks on the mountains.  The brunt of Wickwire's finger-pointing rests solidly on the shoulders of the female climbers he discusses, until he falls "in love" with Marty Hoey, a talented female climber with the sense, it seems, never to have gotten seriously involved with Wickwire, despite his attempts to the contrary.  Wickwire seems to read much into incidents like feet (separated by different sleeping bags) accidentally touching in a overcrowded tent.  After the reader is forced to endure reading a series of desperate, petulant, and adolescent notes and conversations directed from Wickwire to Hoey, he recounts her death on Everest perfunctorily, for the most part, and in terms of how his wife forgave him for this one-sided indiscretion. All things considered, I'm not sure who should be more outraged: Mary Lou Wickwire, reading her husband's embarassing account of "falling in love" with Hoey (and knowing all her friends and peers will be reading it too), or Marty Hoey herself, to whom Wickwire attributes a number of childish and maudlin love notes, and who is no longer here to defend herself.  To be fair, Wickwire may not be the narrow-minded boor he appears to be as when, in 1985, he sadly acknowledges of the inevitable entry of women into the legal profession (one wonders what rock he was living under, or climbing over, not to know that women entered the legal profession long before then).  The book, while also hampered by a ridiculous title, is full of stilted prose and dialogue.  In Wickwire's world, climbers never say things like "We've gotta get down the mountain, fast." Instead, they make proclamations like, "We must descend quickly, or we shall perish upon the mountain." If they were climbing in King Arthur's time, maybe; in this day and age, no one speaks like that.  As a result, the dialogue sounds stilted and fictitious, even if it had a basis in fact.  The prose lingers too long, and clumsily,  on Wickwire's relationships with those around him, even though his relationships seem rather shallow.  Again, this may be the fault of the co-writer or the source, one never knows.  I would heartily recommend saving your money and time, and reading a more climbing-related and less self-centered and angsty text 
 People blew this CD way out of proportion on how good it was. Yeah it sold 9 million and held #1 in the Top 40 charts for a good minute, but c'mon people. He remade a song to when girls were in preschool playing jump rope. I think he did a decent job, when trying to please a certain crowd (mainly the crowd who listens to a lot of alternative music and very little rap). Now the rest of the CD really didn't appeal to me except Batter Up and E.I. (before they became hit singles) Some of it was pointless singing and weak catchy rhymres for an attempt to get your ears in tuned, and to get airplay on the radio (a good example of this is the track Loven Me). I can sit here and type about how bad Nelly is as a rapper, but that would be very pointless. So to however many people that do not have this album, you can get it to add to the sales or you can be real about it and just not buy it and never think of it again 
 Simply stated,I was not pleased.  I thought this was a compilation of various artists as well.  I was disappointed.  I really ordered the wrong album.  I wished I had read the comments before I purchased. This is probably best suited to be used as bedtime sleeping music only 
 This "gentleman" was on the Stephen Colbert Report last night claiming that the "Supreme Court gave women the right to unlimited abortions at any time during their pregnancy".  Anyone who has actually bothered to read Roe Vs. Wade (unlike Ponnuru) knows that ruling only allows voluntary abortion during the first trimester. After that it is regulated by the state and most states have laws limiting voluntary abortions to the first trimester only. It's full text as well as state abortion laws are on the internet, look it up.  The argument over abortion is a legitimate one, but these sorts of tactics make the Right to Life Movement look like idiots led by a pack of not only liars, stupid liars...  
 Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations, the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on Love Melancholy, which Burton waggishly wrote in Latin, untranslated. Burton demands enough of one's patience; one shouldn't have to put up with this sort of nonsense from his editor, even if one's Latin is good. After plodding through over a thousand pages, the reader has earned a little titillating trivia. Also, if you've forgotten your Latin, Burton's notes are left untranslated. Finally, I'll say that although Burton is amusing, the book is too long with too little content. Go back to his sources, read Swift, read Marcus Aurelius, read Kierkegaard on religious despair; and then, if you have time, read Burton-- or skim him 
 Dear author, reader, brother, sister, friend,  I apologize for being the bearer of bad news, but the traditions in the Andes just arent quite what they used to be.  The author of this book conducted her so-called research in 1996, but a lot has changed in less than ten years.  The communities of Qeros have changed a lot too, and the supposed Reality the author tries to come to terms with in this book is very different from what she describes.    Tourism and the Mystical Tourism industry in Peru have severely transformed the spiritual climate in Qeros, as well as elsewhere.  Most, but not all, so-called traditions that exist today are for the benefit of foreign tourists with money.  (I find it hard to believe that the author is unaware of that fact, though she doesnt mention it much.)  The supposedly mystical experiences and knowledge herein Must be received as one receives a report from a tourist.  In other words, take this book as the information gathered by someone who does Not speak the language, hasnt done her homework, got some of the names wrong, and interpreted what she saw through decidedly western eyes.    While claiming to present the Andean Mystical tradition as a self-contained and unromanticized whole, the author does little more than reveal her own lack of cultural immersion and over-simplifications in the face of an entirely alien religious, mystical, and spiritual system (as bound, importantly, in a deep, ancient, and wholly unique cultural framework).  What little she does to reveal spiritual insights (and frankly, many of these insights are just cases of poor interpretation, or simply incorrect, period) is perverted by a lack of cultural awareness and sensitivity, paramount in giving the spiritual issues context.    For many years I have studied firsthand with and have close friends among the Qeros, conversing in their language (Quechua), not mine.  What I have come to understand is that it is NOT vital that we understand their spiritual tradition-- in our western arrogance and self-importance, indeed it is insulting-- unless we are willing to do what it takes to KNOW the traditions.    The author seeks to explain and understand, but just doesnt know at all.  I wish her well on her continued spiritual journey, but truly wonder what she hopes to gain by furthering a romanticized and westernized image of a very distinct spiritual and cultural tradition.  I give her the benefit of the doubt, though, and lament that perhaps she truly has no idea how far from the truth she is.    (... 
 Seriously....I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet.  It was all I use to play online.  After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since.  Online play was non existent.  Everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist.  It was ridiculus.  Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake.  This latest edition adds nothing to the series.  Do not purchase this game....there are many better games out there 
 I did not find this book to have any "solutions." It was simply the usual self-help book which never goes to the root of any problem 
 I read this book with absolutely no knowledge of Barna, his revolution, or any biases in relation to it.  I would like to make the comment that this book is seriously flawed in the superficial and short-sightedness that it demonstrates.    Thankfully, the author does not claim to have pulled any of his data that he uses to support his theory from anywhere other than the American churches.  However, he then uses it to apply to the Church, which is global in nature, and that is the book's serious flaw.  It is short-sighted in that he does not seem to apply anything about the global Church and local churches to his theories other than what is happening, according to his observations, in the US.  While there may be some value to these insights, I resent that he is equating what he observes in American churches as what is happening and will happen in the global Church.    I'd like to see him ask the question why while American churches, in his opinion, are failing, are so many churches globally flowering and prospering?  What makes him think that American churches, which make up a MINORITY of all churches worldwide, should be the sole trendsetter.  From the perspective of what is presented in this book, it seems the author is living in a bubble and is making a superficial and overly generalized prediction for the Church.      Sure, this book is easy to read and understand.  Sadly, I believe it is actually the poorer for these qualities.  If it weren't, I could at least try to believe that his writing is not as superficial as it is.  
 Before I get started with my review i must say one thing. Im not just a mindless hater, trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise. I liked the original movies, with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman. with that being said here is why i really didn't like this movie.  i felt it was too long and drawn out. Too much time was spent on Lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left. she whined to her reporter friend, she whined to her husband, she whined to clark kent, she whined to her boss, and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene. essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick/comic flick. and although the soundtrack was stunning at times, too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play. yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough.  basically im saying this movie was 90% melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and 10% action.   and although the action scenes where pretty cool, it is nothing we haven't seen before in a superman flick, or any other super hero flick.   acting wise, i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job, nothing compaired to reeves, but im not going to complain about that too much, he was servicable. and noone can complain about kevin spacey, he is just awesome, although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex. did not like louis lane. too whiney.  story wise, this movie didnt really make much sense. it was way too out there. i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on. lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go "yeah lets move there" and lex is going to make lots of money. not likely. i mean it would take years among years to make that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable. i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work. i mean most criminals want their power NOW, instant gratification. maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline, i just think they could have thought of something better, and more feasable.  this movie was alright, it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about 30 minutes of melodrama away. and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies, cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie. however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book 
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 Hi,  I purchased of one these pools for my then 4 yr old daughter and she did enjoy it for a shiort while, then one morning I went to check on the pool which was covered with a large blue tarp since it does not come with a cover and to my surprise the pool was totally deflated and the whole middle and bottom of the pool was gone, apparently the crows liked how it tasted and ate the pool and just the sides of the pool.  Millions and millons of tiny bits of plastic ppol were left all over our backyard and it took hours for my daughter and I to pick up.  I would never have guessed the pool would be eaten!  It was fun for the few days she played in it but maybe seeing this review just maybe they will also provide a hard cover for this pool.  We are left without a pool since this is gone.  Maybe the manufacture shoud make the bottom not so tasty for the birds and more durable so kids can enjoy it longer.  I have heard of one other person who had this experience as well.  Warning:  Kepp this pool away from birds!  I have been advised by a rep at Amazon to purchase reflective tape to place around the pool to ward off the birds!  We are hoping we do not have the same experience when we purchase the Family Size Center Pool.  Best Regards,  The Youngs Family. 
 I was quite disappointed with this film.  The director used some non-actors to play some of the parts, and it shows.  Also, the editing and camera work is shoddy.  In one particular scene, you see Mouchette turning her body, which causes a coffee cup to move toward the edge of the table.  In the next shot, the cup falls to the floor.  The effect is very self-conscious and clumsy.  Finally, the actress playing the girl fails to convince us of her state of mind that occurs at the fim's end.  Perhaps other viewers may like it 
 This is written more for reader's theater than in performance style.  So unless you're very creative and can re-write, I would pass.  This would be good for Sunday School lessons where you can go right to the appropriate verses to follow up.  Not the best for just performance 
 Whomever decided on putting this box set together must have been smoking crack.  Since when did 8675309/jenny become a classic rock hit?  Are you kidding me....come on!  No Hendrix,Floyd,Zeppelin.  Classic rock my arse 
 As the saying goes, "Those who can't do teach, those who can't teach, teach teaching. 
 I read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport AND low ambient sound i-pod headpohones without breaking the bank (I'm on a plane frequently). I wanted something that I wouldn't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels. I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still. So then I thought these will be great workout headphones (won't be upset if I break or lose them), HOWEVER, the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand. The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head). I'm on the hunt for better quality headphones 
 This is great if you have all the time and money to spend on Hors D'Oeuvres--I would not buy it again, but it was fun to look at 
 I have been a big fan of New Found Glory since "All Downhill From Here" came out. I bought Catalyst and loved it, so I bought all their old albums, loved them all too. I found out New Found Glory had a new cd coming out.....couldnt wait. So i go out and buy this cd the day it came out, I was that excited, I brought it home thinking "all right, this will be awesome!!!" Over the next 40-some minutes I experienced the biggest dissapointment of my life. Every song was a ballad, there were no fun songs like "Hit or Miss" "Forget My Name" "The Great Houdini" "Your Biggest Mistake" or even an amazingly well written song like "No News Is Good News." I basically got a whole cd of "I Don't Wanna Know" which in my mind was New Found Glory's worst song to date. I listened to this cd once, and I barely made it through to the end and when it was over, I seriously considered throwing it in the trash. This band has died, after all those years of fun and great songs, they have been destroyed. I will do my best to erase this peice from my mind so I can enjoy their old albums again 
 If you are looking for a book that can inspire you, perhaps this is it. However, I just didn't find this book to be practical in the least. Every room was so over the top, you wonder how anyone could accomplish anything in these apartments. I understand the idea of a haven, but i kept thinking about all of the dust that could get stuck in all of the billows of fabric and trinkets that were were literally wall-to-wall in every room. And where to sit? Where do you eat? There was NO "virgin" space that could be considered useful. I consider myself to have a pretty open mind, but nothing in this book was worth keeping. I returned it the day I recieved it. I agree that any of Rachel Ashwell's books would be a better buy than this. Her books are great for inspiring your home, but also inspire party ideas and treasure hunts 
 This is the worst, most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.  There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while, their actions just become inexplicable.  The author's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.  It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman's darkness or one of his minions.  Additionally, the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands, nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.  What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.  Unlike some of Stephen King's work (ie: The Stand), there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.  It's evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.  All I can say is that this book is ugly, ugly, ugly.  At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness, but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.  The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for  him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.  I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence, I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author's work again.  It's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist, Dave McKean, who maybe hasn't completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has.  His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened-up the book--and maybe a little because the title intrigued me.  But it's unfortunate that the industry rewards "clever" works such as Mr. Gaiman's with undue praise.  I've never so strongly disliked a book.  Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book?  Well, don't believe the hype, this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X-men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you 
 I bought this book expecting it to be about kitten care and it told entirely too much about breed and the 'evolution' of cats. It didn't explain how to care for and raise a kitten. I was not impressed with the content 
 I found this in the philosphy section of a local store and was intrigued by the timely theme and title. Nothing else proved commendable about this book. This is the sort of book that gives philosphy a bad name. A dense fog of jagron so abstract that it almost seems like a parody.   I must admit I could not finish this book. I was barely able to penetrate the first two chapters. Several honest attempts to scan the rest of the book read like pure gibberish 
 This book is so generic in its advice that it is all but useless. It tries to be all things to all cameras, and therefore says nothing specific about anything. Add to this the way it tries to tout Kodak film, and you realize Kodak should be paying people to read this book. But they still wouldn't know how to work their cameras 
 have borrowed 'hawke' three times and tried to read along and finish it, but three times i've failed. this one is no exception. read like comic book with unbelievable characters and plots, and the writing...sorry, mom, i'd rather read mathew riley's video game like books than pick up your junk 
 Trendy production, whispered vocals and repetitious songs...this is easily the Banana's worst album, despite obvious efforts to improve upon the dancey material in their catalog.  There's no reason why this album  couldn't have been sequenced without breaks, because the songs largely  sound the same.  With the loss of their UK label and all the trappings of  London's corporate identity, the Bananas sound like they're out on a limb,  trying to re-prove themselves as performers.  The group has always been at  the mercy of their production team, but instead of infusing the songs with  their trademark bounce and pop hooks, the material on Ultra Violet is  methodical and tiresome.  And with the exception of their loyal fans, I  doubt that this album will be remembered by anyone ten years hence.  Overall, a lackluster and tedious recording that only a dyed-in-the-wool  BananaFan or disco dolly could find listenable 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out. The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud 
 One WEAK night!...zero stars if that was available. I never realized Bon Jovi was this bad a live band. They obviously get a LOT of production help in the studio because this album (several different concerts in several different venues) is ALL bad.  Sorry for them and sorry for me for buying it 
 The book lacks originality and boldness, that is required for a post-colonial understanding of the past 300 years of Indian history 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
 Considering the reputation of this book, I was quite shocked to read some of the errors it contains with regard to Australia and New Zealand to the extent I cannot take for granted anything else within its pages.  A short list:   1. Anzacs, pie floaters and lamingtons are not "food traditions" bought from Britain by migrants and convicts.  All of them originated in Australia in the 20th century.  2. The swagman boiling potatoes in his billy can is a new one to me. Billies were generally used for making tea. Most swaggies did not get more than bully beef, flour, sugar and tea.  3. Anzacs are biscuits, not cakes.  4. The "pie floater" is a meat pie in a bowl of pea soup, not tomato sauce, and is not our national dish unless a national dish by definition is something almost universally derided and never eaten.  5. In what appears to be an attempt to cater for different terminology in different countries, the authors have put corn syrup in brackets after golden syrup. However, these are not the same thing, golden syrup being derived from sugar cane and having an entirely different flavour.  6. As above, icing and frosting are not the same thing.  Any attempt to make lamingtons with frosting will result in total failure.  7. In New Zealand, food is not "simple" meat and veg, but rather a reflection of the diversity of the country's population due to immigration.  In particular, food from Thailand, Malaysia and India is common and modern New Zealand cuisine strongly reflects its influences. The book's information may have been accurate 20-30 years ago, but certainly not now.  8. In New Zealand, kiwifruit is most certainly not eaten with every meal!  This is just a sample from the information regarding Australia and New Zealand and clearly demonstrates extremely poor research. The sort of nonsense you might expect from people who still believe Australians ride kangaroos to work.  I suppose for people who don't know any better, it's great, though to me it smacks of the Emperor's new clothes. I shudder to think that anyone has 100% faith in this book. Given Larousse's reputation (not to mention price) I expect a lot more. 
 Frommer's Maui rates the tired, moldy, tacky Noelani this way: "Everything is first class, from the furnishings to the oceanfront location." Nothing could be further from the truth, and we booked in there for a week based on this blatantly dishonest description!  The fold out map is useless, lacking any detail whatsoever, a real con job.  "Maui Revealed" completely blows Frommer into the weeds, but what's most annoying is that trusting Frommer could ruin your vacation! Makes you wonder if Frommer is on the take 
 From the start, Trotsky always thought that revolution in any one country could only succeed if it received the active support of revolutions in other countries. But similarly, these other revolutions would also need to receive help from others: the Russian revolution could not survive without a revolution in Germany, but neither could a German revolution survive without a Russian. This mutual dependence meant that no country could ever start a revolution: it would have to wait on the success of another.  So to provoke these indispensable other revolutions, Trotsky was quite prepared to invade other countries. For example, in 1919 he wrote, "A cavalry corps of 30-40,000 horsemen must be formed to invade India." Similarly, at Brest-Litovsk in February 1918, Trotsky made the Soviet revolution's very survival depend on the putative German revolution, risking total defeat by the German army on the throw of a revolution in Germany. He said, "We declare we end the war but do not sign a peace. They will be unable to make an offensive against us. If they attack us, our position will be no worse than now ..." This phrase-mongering did not frighten the German generals, who saw only that Trotsky was refusing to sign the offered peace. They then attacked, as he said they could not do, and seized millions of square miles of Soviet territory, making the Soviet position far worse than before. In the 1930s, the Opposition leagued with Hitler. Churchill wrote, "The German government was in touch with important Russian personalities through the Soviet embassy in Prague. The plot aimed at overthrowing Stalin and introducing into Russia a new pro-German regime. Soviet Russia carried out a merciless but doubtless useful purge of political and economic circles. The Soviet army was purged of pro-German elements." Goebels admitted, "Stalin got rid of all the opposition circles in the Red Army and thus succeeded in making sure there were no more defeatist groups in the Army." The Opposition fought against the programmes of industrialisation and collectivisation that made possible all the Soviet Union's heroic achievements. For instance, in April 1930, Trotsky's Bulletin of the Opposition said, "Put a stop to `mass collectivisation'. ... Put a stop to the hurdle race of industrialisation. ... Abandon the `ideals' of self-contained economy. Draw up a new variant of a plan providing for the widest possible intercourse with the world market." In 1938, Trotsky called for the collective farms to be closed down, and for Soviet enterprises to be handed over to foreign powers.  He consistently called on the Soviet people to overthrow the Soviet government when Hitler attacked. He called for a `revolutionary uprising', an `insurrection' against the Soviet government, when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. He wrote, "the impetus to the Soviet workers' revolutionary upsurge will probably be given by events outside the country." "The first social shock, external or internal, may throw the atomized Soviet Society into civil war." He asked, "Can we expect that the Soviet Union will come out of the coming great war without defeat? To this frankly posed question, we will answer as frankly: If the war should remain only a war, the defeat of the Soviet Union would be inevitable. In a technical, economic and military sense, imperialism is incomparably more strong. If it is not paralysed by revolution in the West, imperialism will sweep away the present regime." "The defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable in case the new war shall not provoke a new revolution. ... If we theoretically admit war without revolution, then the defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable." He wrote, "It would be childish to think that the Stalin bureaucracy can be removed by means of a Party or Soviet Congress. Normal, constitutional means are no longer available for the removal of the ruling clique. ... They can be compelled to hand over power to the Proletarian vanguard only by FORCE." "Inside the Party, Stalin has put himself above all criticism and the State. It is impossible to displace him except by assassination. Every oppositionist becomes ipso facto a terrorist." Trotsky lied to the `Dewey Commission' when he told them that that he had not been organising an underground in the Soviet Union. The leader of Trotsky's Fourth International, Ernest Mandel, openly applauded Boris Yeltsin, the key figure in the counter-revolution that finally restored capitalism in the Soviet Union. He wrote, "The reformer Yeltsin represents the tendency which wants to reduce the gigantic state apparatus. Consequently he follows in Trotsky's footsteps." The Socialist Workers Party backed the US-organised and funded terrorists, which spawned bin Laden, against the people of Afghanistan. "Mujehadin victory will encourage the opponents of Russian rule everywhere in the USSR and Eastern Europe." 
 I have never typed a review before, but after reading this book, I felt compelled to voice my opinion.  I was raised Catholic and as I grew older found myself questioning my own faith.  I have many of the same conflicting feelings between science and religion that the author himself claimed to have.  When I read the description for "The Case for a Creator", I was filled with anticipation of what lay within the pages.  However, once I reached page 50, I felt like the air had been let out of the tires.  How, I wondered, could the book claim to present a "case", when the mention of a "case" leads the reader to believe that, as in the court of law, both sides will be presented and argued fairly, and the final determination will rest in the hands of the jury, or in the case of a book, in the hands of the reader.  However, in the "One-Sided Case for a Creator", Strobel destroys his own credibility by not even attempting to cleverly conceal his agenda towards the idea of an intelligent and divine creator.  It is almost an insult to the reader, as if Strobel is saying to us, "I don't want or expect you to think about, analyze, or question what I am saying, I just expect you to lap it up and accept it as truth."  I find Strobel's writing to be maddening...at the end of each chapter I was left with a hungry feeling, as though I had just eaten a plate of air.  With each chapter, I hoped that Strobel would redeem himself by presenting both sides to his so-called "case"...however, he consistently disappointed by presenting only his side.  After reading the book, I was left confused, skeptical, and felt the need to research the side of the case that Strobel conveniently neglected.  A book that could have been a masterpiece falls far short and is an insult to any reader who is looking for a well-rounded argument.  If you agree with Strobel's point of view, you will love it and will lap it up...but why read it if you already believe in the idea of a divine creator???  If you are searching for a convincing book of substance, look elsewhere.   
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 This must be the WORST documentary I have ever watched. I love Hollywood legends & I love old LA restaurants. Musso & Franks and Cantors on Fairfax were favorites when I was working out there. I never got to Chasens & would have loved to know more about it, but all I saw in this awful thing were a bunch of unhappy soon-to-be-ex-employees grousing repeatedly about their sad lot & the "good old days" but no evidence at all of the latter. 60 years of history, yet nothing at all about the menu, the decor, no details about the clientele other than that they were "stars". Well, maybe the medium is the message here & it was nothing but fame walking in & out the door & people sneeking a peek, but the food was really mediocre along with the decor. Lucky they lasted as long as they did I guess. Certainly the owners & employees I saw kvetching up on the screen didn't make me regret never going there 
 Very left anti-capitalism book. Contains no cogent arguments. Facts are skewed or are outright lies. Example: Page 56 states "The huge budget deficits during the Reagan years in the 1980s were due to tax cuts..." When , in fact, data from 'Budget of the United States Government: Historical Tables' show large increases in Government revenue during the years after the tax cuts. The increased deficits being due to large house/senate spending. Of course, in this book, Bill Clinton can do no wrong. Over all, this book is a very hard left leaning and biased work. I wish I could get my money back 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 I have read this book (and its companion volume) a couple of times, and to be honest I am not a fan.  Many of Jan Fennell's suggestions are useful, but none are original.   Ms Fennell's method is based on the idea of using the non-violent language of the wolf pack to put your dog in his rightful subordinate place, and therefore gain his understanding and cooperation.  Alpha wolves eat first - so Ms Fennell has the dog owner eat dinner before his dog.  Alpha wolves take the pack out hunting - so we are bid to walk our dogs daily.  Alpha wolves aren't demonstrative - so we are told to ignore our dogs for five minutes each time we arrive home from work.  These suggestions are sensible, but they are hardly revolutionary.  Maintaining dominant status by behaving like an "alpha" wolf is a technique that has been championed by many other authors - the only difference is that Ms Fennell gives this process the cutesy name of "Amichien bonding".  The technique is a good one for restoring a relationship with a dog that has been spoiled or confused in the past by weak or misinformed owners. Its success lies not only in the owner mimicking canine behaviour, but also in the institution of house rules and a predictable daily routine for the dog.    So what is wrong with this book?  The first fatal flaw is the unrealistic simplicity of the method.  Ms Fennell seems to believe that all canine behavioural problems are caused by the dog wishing to be alpha.  It is certainly true that a dog with a misplaced sense of his own importance will probably become a problem dog.  However, dogs can also behave badly for a plethora of other reasons - poor training, learned fear, boredom, health issues, confusion and inherent high prey drive, to name just a few.  Ms Fennell's insistence that all canine problems are dominance problems that can be cured by "Amichien bonding" is unfortunately just not realistic.       For a professional dog trainer, Ms Fennel also displays a rather disturbing lack of knowledge about several dog breeds.  At one point she states that it may be impossible to fully train Bull Terriers "and dogs of this type" due to their inherent "savage natures"!  One gets the impression that she has been unable to train this type of dog herself and holds a grudge about it.  Whatever the reason, I find it somewhat disingenuous of her to ignore the fact that other trainers have managed to train these breeds to very high standards, and blame her own failure to do so on the dogs instead of on her own methods.  In short?  If you know very little about dog behaviour and have a mildly pushy dog, then this book isn't a bad buy.  Certainly, applying the "Amichien bonding" advice won't hurt.  It is the same type of programme as recommended by dog behaviourists the world over (you can get much of the same information for free on the internet, from Shirley Chong's website for example).    However, Ms Fennell's book is not a comprehensive guide to solving every dog's problems.  If your dog has moderate to serious behavioural problems, save your money and book a consultation with a professional behaviourist.  Your dog will thank you for it.   
 Sadly, this book has a number of inaccuracies and is poorly researched.  It is obvious that the Ferrars rely to heavily on Robert Graves and his mythological theories, many of which have been debunked by better scholarship.  The rituals were bordering on insulting, especially the Greek ones.  It is obvious that they have never read a book on greek religion.  Additionally, they tend to be very heavy-handed on the opinion, and not as interested in fact as one would expect from the Ferrars.  If you want books on myth, please pass this one up 
 Man did I want to like this movie. Hackman is the best and the possibility of finding a mid-70s Gem was really tantalizing, but...this film is really, really mediocre. First we have sub-plot city going on, bad mid life crisis stuff with Susan Clark and Hackman "Trying to communicate" about their failing relationship. It's tough on Hackmans character "Harry" see 'cause he used to be an NFL player and now he's reduced to being a private eye, she hates it, he does not want to give it up and everyone concerned gets a bad speech.  Don't get me wrong, this is no "MegaForce", where the film is so bad it becomes campy and actually enjoyable. This is just...mediocre. Buy "Harper" with Paul Newman instead 
 I once read a review that said this was Joyce's most controversial novel to date. So, I gave it a shot. I'd read one short story by her that I really liked. However, this novel was practicaly unreadable. I mean... there were english words and sentences, but it was very cumbersome for some reason. I didn't think the writing was tight at all. So, I didn't finish it. I think the only thing controversial about it was how boring it was. 
 I'm a great fan of Bujold, and in particular of the Vorkosigan series. But this one is a lemon. Clearly, and very unusually for her, Bujold had nothing to say and no idea what to write about. The only reason to read this book is if you've read every other Vorkosigan book (and the superb Curse of Chalion), in which case you probably loved them so much you wouldn't trust this review anyway. 
 I received the wrong size originally. The company was prompt in sending me another dress, however, I received a third dress which I refused by mail and I am trying to get my credit card adjusted.  The dress is lovely 
 Other reviews were right, The first disc was great the second froze up halfway thru the Son of Frankenstein... the disc was loose when I rcv'd it. and is useless junk 
 I purchase this book from the Amazon Marketplace and the order was handled by partnerorders@alphacraze.com. The book included a CD which contained sample test questions but the book or CD did not include the password to access the CD. I have contacted alphacraze.com 3 times with negative results. I do not recommend the book or alphacraze.com!!!!!!!!!! 
 It is likely, if you are looking at an access point rather than a basic broadband router, that you are wanting more versatility in your wireless setup. If this is the case, this D*Link product is a waste of time. Despite being advertised as an Access Point (AP), the DWL-G700AP is not a true AP.   There is no client AP mode (allows the AP to be a client to another AP), there is no wireless bridge mode, there is no wireless repeater mode. In fact, everything you would expect to see on an AP is missing. And D*link do not seem to be able to keep track of firmware releases properly either. My AP came with 1.03 which, according to D*Link does not exist.   As such, it's virtually useless as anything other than a VERY basic access point. Buy the Linksys WAP54G instead and get a real AP 
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 Much of this book felt like I was watching an infommercial for UDAP pepper spray, except I was not only wasting my time, but also my money, by paying for the commercial by buying this book.  I was firmly convinced (prior to reading this book) of the value of pepper spray as a LAST RESORT defense against bear attack- after abiding by all the known SOPs for avoiding surprising or provoking bears.  This book is an ad for a product produced by an admitted friend of the author, Mike Matheny of UDAP.  I have nothing personal against Mr Matheny, but this method of stealth advertising will only cause me to continue to carry Counter Assault exclusively, which, with common sense and good luck, I have never had to use while travelling in bear country 
 have you ever thought of the fact that after the first few weeks or months, babies NEED a good nights sleep as much as their parents?  children dont like to go to bed, but they need to anyway.  Anything a mom can do to incourage a good nights sleep in the longrun is not a "selfish mom" but an effective one 
 Is  it morally right and tactically wise to publish such a book? It is possible to say that bin Laden does not need a forum, and that his messages are eagerly transmitted by his followers to one another through all modern technical means, including the 'Internet'. And that therefore the presentation of his speeches in chronological order will not give much of a lift or incentive to already committed terrorists. It is possible to argue that those who will read such a book are by and large precisely those who deplore bin Laden, and who simply wish to better understand how this particular evildoer  has deepened in his hatred of the West, and determination to kill innocents, through time. Thus it might be argued that the texts provided simply do a public service in informing us all of the exact nature of one mass- murdererer.  He is to himself the defender of Islam, which he sees attacked by the West, and he has come to the conclusion gradually that the murder of as many Jews and Christians as it takes is justified if this will lead to the Islamic domination of Mankind.  But then again Mr. Bin Laden is not simply  a theorist. He is the man responsible for the murder of thousands of people, including those on 9/11. Giving him another kind of forum somehow does not seem morally wise or right. And this especially as there are hundreds of thousands, no millions of young Muslims , ( and non- Muslims) walking around out there, who might take this book as 'marching orders'. It seems to me the most important point of all is missed by the Editor of this work. Bin Laden may be the name that evokes the most horror. But in fact there are more important leaders in the War Against the West, and the War of Terror to topple Human Civilization than Bin - Laden.He is symbolically the  major leader of  Global Islamic  Strategy but  its most important one now is the President of Iran. The President of Iran is  calling for the destruction of the United States, and the Islamic Rule of the world in terms Bin Laden certainly agrees with. Bin Laden is not as Noah Feldman presents him in his otherwise excellent NY Times review of this book , a 'deviation' from the main stream of Islam today. As we see with the growing power of fundamentalist Islam throughout the world , Bin Laden speaks to the heart of a good share, perhaps a majority of the leaders and people of the Islamic world.   As I understand it the Western world, the free world, the world led by the United States is now in a struggle for its life against a kind of totalitarian force whose aim is to destroy it. Bin Laden will not be the one to lead the legions in doing this. But his written works, his speeches, his communications, his network of Terror, his inspiration to widening circles within the Islamic world , are an important element in this war. Again I am not so sure it was wise to give him this additional forum. 
 Ms. Michaels really missed the mark on this one! This book had real potential for being a good thriller, but too much time was spent on mundane events and it turned out to be a long, boring read. If someone has  recommened Barbara Michaels to you, I would suggest "Stiches in  Time", or "The Dancing Floor" - she really is a good writer.  This book is not worth reading 
 Children of all ages who love yarns about the French Foreign Legion ought to try the granddaddy of all such books, UNDER TWO FLAGS, a classic 1867 adventure novel by "Ouida", pseudonym of the English novelist Marie-Louise de la Rame, 1839-1908.  ISBN: 0192823280 
 I can't complain about shipping, it was really fast. But i get the thing i plug it in, use it 1 time. The 2nd time i plug it in, the metal piece that plugs into the phone, jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding it, making a freakin paper weight. Cheap piece of cra 
 If you want a review of the plot itself, complete with spoilers, feel free to read the other reviews.   My biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed, again and again, due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn't keep the story straight.   There is a homage to Asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm. That would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film. There are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible.  That said, it was a bit enjoyable. The cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given. If the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked, maybe I would have cared what happened to them.  The dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say, "Oooh, cool".  Good premise, good effects, good acting, but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film 
 Tony Brown's paranoid fantasy about world orders make this an almost impossible book to read.  Not backed up with any facts but the authors claims jump from topics a diverse as the implied assassination of Princes Diana to a general Freemasonary plot to rule the world to the world banking system.  Often these topics are covered in a few pages with Mr. Brown liberally jumping from one topic to another.  His only references are other conspiracy books as bizarre as his own.  Schitzophrenic paranoid fantasies quoting other paranoid fantasies and masking itself as some sort of intelligent thesis.  What nonsense!  But hence the crux.  Since it is a "conspiracy" (a word Mr. Brown uses liberally), it can never be proven or disproven, hence it's validity.  Based on that version of logic one could never disprove the existance of Santa Claus either 
 This is not a review of Ms. Yates's writing.  Instead, I am awarding the single star to the physical book perpetrated by the University of Chicago Press in 1991.  The good news is that this edition doesn't cost very much.  The bad news is that the 1991 edition is a bad reproduction of an earlier edition.  The ink bleeds all over some of the pages.  There are diagonal streaks on many pages.  Sometimes the ink is light grey on one side of a diagonal streak, while it is dark and smudged on the other side.  Parts of letters that landed in the streak are missing.  A note on the back of the title page claims only that "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the ... Standard ... for Library Materials."  Does this less than ringing endorsement mean that the paper is acidic and will soon deteriorate?  If so, it won't be much of a loss 
 I bought this hoping to learn more about the Vietnamese people and their history. I got bogged down with all the poetry and prose quoted by the writer. While he brushes off the importance of the battle of Dien Bien Phu in a couple of lines; he drones on quoting (translating) obscure Vietnamese writers until the reader becomes weary. His premise seems to be that if you understand some writer (who he thinks is interesting) and attach importance to what he said then you will understand Vietnam. His annoying treatment of Yin and Yang finally caused me to put the book down and look for another way to understand Vietnam. If you like words such as "efficacy" and "entropy" you will love this writer; if such words irritate you, give this book a pass 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 Positive:  -Size, good surface area  -Chipping net  Negatives:  -Poor instructions  -Very hard to set up by yourself.  Really takes 2 people, because nothing fits tight, so as you try to get one side in, the other side pops out.  -Nothing locks in.  Plastic caps to hold rear poles don't fit tightly.  The 'male' sticks that go into the 'female' section of the rear poles are not tight, so a wind from the rear pushes it over.  I have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable.  I taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners.  I've had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug 
 This wanna be director obviously tries every cliche in the book and tries to gain credibility by using over the hill non talents like Ryan Oneal. Plain and simple....just pass this one up 
 The old phone I had was heavy, and the battery life was horrible. You have to put this phone on the charger every night or you won't have a phone in the morning even if you don't use it that much. I thought for the price that it would be the best phone in the world. To my suprise the only great thing is that it's not heavy 
 This book is terrible! It's horribly written complete with dialogue that is as trite and flat as a bad 80s sitcom. It starts off with a passive unemployed stay-at-home father whose wife appears to be having an affair. It then develops into a highly boring and implausible tale about nanoparticles trying to take over the world, or trying to eat us all, or something. I don't think Crichton ever really got that far in his thinking.  ***possible spoilers below***  This book is very important in pinpointing a few useful life-rules:  1. Anyone who looks like they have lost weight/bulked up is dangerous! (Those nanoarticles are deadly, but boy, do they help ones' body image)  2. There is nothing much out-of-the-ordinary about a mother slapping her baby when she gets home from work. In fact, if anything, you should always be the one to apologise...it doesn't matter for what.  3. If you're trying to get a few crazy nanoparticles to rule the world, make sure the FIRST thing you do is call in the main guy who is able to destroy your whole big plan.  4. Nanoparticles bear a striking resemblance to sandflies. They say they're thousands of times small than a hairs' breadth...but don't worry, when they buzz around you'll see them no problems. They also have the ability to bite.  The whole things is so badly written from start to finish that it wasn't even a  guilty pleasure! The characters are all so one dimensional and the whole thing towards the end (Ricky and Julia being coated in nanoparticles?!?!) is just ridiculous.   Plot holes are abound, for example, why on earth would this thing need to be transferred via saliva/kissing? They're nanoparticles! If they can buzz around and take differennt shapes etc, then surely they can fly into whatever or wherever they wish.  The BIGGEST surprise for me was that in the end, our 'hero' manages to save the world from these critters with explosions, a trusty sidekick, and some kind of virus that the plant has been haroburing all along.  If someone can give me back my 2 days that I spent reading this rubbish I'd be eternally grateful. I'd ask for my money back, but the book was given to me for free by a bookstore. Obviously they knew its true worth 
 I shopped around a lot before I purchased this book from a used book dealer.  I needed more than one, so I had to shop around.  I ended up buying more than a few.  These books are in excellent shape, no highlighting, no writing in the books, and fantastic bindings.  The base price was less than most of the prices in the Amazon listing.  Even the publisher's price for a NEW book was less than most of the listings in Amazon.  I find it sad that folks are selling books with higher prices than the publisher is charging for a new one 
 I have had this manual for a year, and it's answered very few of my questions. The writing isn't nearly as clear as it could be, but moreover there are a lot of missing topics. Just now I am looking for guidance on uninstalling software, and it's not even mentioned. Earlier today I was looking for help on iTunes, and it couldn't answer my (pretty simple) question on that either. I had Sharon Aker?'s Mac Bible for 0S 9, and it was fantastic. I thought this would be similar, but it's not nearly as good. I hoping to find a better manual 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 I spent all day yesterday reading "I'm Watching You," but I regret having done so.  First, there are way too many characters (about 20) to keep straight.  Second, [...]  Third, the last 20 pages wrap up everything very quickly, giving necessary background information which should have been incorporated more smoothly.  Fourth, Kristen (the heroine) is stupidly stubborn, insisting that the murderer "will not drive her out of her house."  [...]  No, Kristen will not leave.  (Nor apparently will she buy shades).  Even when she has to have a 24 hour police guard, plus the hero (and later, his father) keeping watch,  Kristen will not leave her house.  This stupid  contrivance exists just to put her in danger.  I got very tired of the many times that she fought off various people who wanted to kill her.  To complete her status as a character who is Too Stupid to Live, is her uninformed assumption about the seriousness of the effects of surgery.  (Yes, I bet you can figure the effect of this too).  A gifted artist who is now a dedicated, articulate, principled prosector never has this assumption verified, even fearing it will end her engagement to the hero?  Yeah, sure.  Yes, "I'm Watching You"  is a page turner, but I found it to be very unpleasant.  Even skipping the explicitly violent parts, I found this book increasingly nasty.  [... 
 The book is written in a means of propaganda, this book did not illustarte how Iran is danger to other nations? The author mentioned that state of Israel was in danger due nuclear Iran. 
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 Sorry-- I don't know what people are raving about.  I am an avid epicurean, and have gone to most good restaurants in NY.  I just don't think Balthazar's recipes or food holds a candle to other NY institutions, like Gotham, Gramercy, etc.  The food at and recipes from Balthazar always tastes a little too greasy and unrefined given how many steps are involved.  Sorry, that's just my personal opinion after making almost ten of the Balthazar recipes 
 whatever your view of this book,it is important to make sure you have the book in its entirety. i purchase this book on Amazon. The version i got was missing 32 pages. the pages go from 1-32 then it repeats pages 1-32 then it jumps to page 65. it is missin pages 33-64. make sure yo ask the sellers to verify that their editions don't have this problem 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 This is a sloppily written book full of errors.  I had to rip out most of the basketweave cardigan on page 29 because the number of stitches instructed by one section of the pattern does not match the number specified in another paragraph.  The patterns seem written to save print space at the expense of clarity and accuracy. I am an experienced (15+ years)knitter, and I found the instructions to be very complicated to follow, requiring the knitter to write the pattern out in longhand so not to miss any steps. This pattern was even described as "perfect for a beginning knitter".   Buy this book for the cute pictures if you like, but if you decide to knit from it, work the pattern out on paper first 
 One might divide economics books into two categories: those that are strong on explanation and intution, and those that are strong on proof. This book has neither, and unfortunately it appears to be the standard in graduate macroeconomics courses. I find myself wondering if it deliberately chooses the most obscure way to write its equations. For instance, in the Solow and Ramsey models, Romer retains the population and household variables throughout the entire proof rather than simply write them in intensive form. If you're reading the book after a lecture, it stands a chance of confusing you, especially because it tries to avoid optimal control theory (not a good idea!) 
 Forget using the antenna for air reception.....its almost useless.  Lots of video noise and no sound on weak channels (no fine tuning possible).  The only saving factor of this item is its cable connection....works fine.  But if you have cable connection available, why hook it up to this small screen player?  
 I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.  These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.  For the price, these can't be beat 
 THE MOUSE THAT ROARED was a disappointment to me in many ways--the tortuous academic prose style, the ever-present word "pedagogy" in all of its various forms, the rather sinister view of the Disney Company's motivations in their influence on education and popular culture.  I was especially disappointed in Giroux's treatmemt of Walt Disney, who he refers to occasionally as "Old Walt Disney" (Old?) In his discussion, he presents as facts some myths about Walt Disney that have been refuted by a host of scholars and historians.  I feel that this is a disservice to the memory of Walt Disney, and further, it makes me question the entire content of the book 
 This movie is GOOD, if you do not think of the traditional Arthurian story.  But, unfortunately, to those of us who like the original Arthurian story, this is really a bad movie.  Also, Richard Gere's character fits his real life attitude and so he really didn't have to act in this movie....  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the movie, as a movie, BUT, it has little to do with the King Arthur legend...  much like the more recent movie about King Arthur.  Because of this, it is a major let down to real Arthurian lovers......  So, I am torn between giving it 4 stars for being a fun and exciting movie and giving it a negative 4 stars for letting us true Arthurian buffs down..... so, I will give it a 2 star rating... 
 I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen, but I have liked a lot of what he's done in the past. I wasted my money on this one. It sounds like uninspired mumbling. Not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs. Nothing stands out. No experimentation. There might be some good story lines in the songs, but I usually can't understand him anyway. I liked two songs, but not enough to get the album out and turn it on. I never desire to play it after a few listenings. So beware, unless your a huge fan and want all his music, this one may let you down. 
 Goldhaber's text, while rated highly by the ABCA is a great outdated disappointment.  It is also not reader friendly.  Most of the endnotes   are dated before 1988 and very hard to find on  CD Rom.  The book reads awkward and definitions  are hard to understand.  There is no mention  of email (even though the book was written  before the web revolution).  Communication  networks are not depicted properly.  Sections  on listening, communication audits, and even  career development are weak, inaccurate,  or outdated.  Anyone using this book would be  well advised to seek permission and use a   communications chapter from one of the established  organizational behavior texts to help the  students grasp and understand the subject matter 
 The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

 Don't buy this edition. Get the first edition, put together by the original editors, G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven (ISBN 0521091691), which is readily available through Amazon. The current edition has been hopelessly corrupted by M. Schofield, who has edited out crucial fragments in order to support his own "Analytical Philosophy" take on the Presocratics. As an example, he has removed crucial fragments which link Parmenides with the Pythagoreans.   So make sure you acquire the 1st Edition of this crucial sourcebook which was edited in an honest fashion by G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven, and ignore any later edition which has been corrupted and invalidated by M. Schofield.  Also, take a look at Peter Kingsley's trilogy of books on Parmenides and Empedocles: "Reality," "In the Dark Places of Wisdom," and "Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition." These books will give you the real fragments, and provide you with a real take on why scholars with the intellectual dishonesty of an M. Schofield will rewrite and even abandon the original texts in order to further their own misguided agendas. 
 I purchased Dr. Street's book out of curiousity of what the author would write to defend the evangelical method of altar calls and the ever so popular sinner's prayer.  Sadly, the book lacks any serious theological treatment of salvation and completely ignores the sovereignty of God in salvation.  The book seeks to be a guide both to evangelists and pastors to how to deliever an "effective" invitation (emphasis on numbers being the key word for effective.)  Dr. Street should have rightly named this book, "The Effective Manipulation Methods" and then traced the poor theology of Charles Finney right down to Billy Graham.  While Dr. Street does try to answer his critics (such as Martin Llyod-Jones) he never truly gives any answers but simply lists Llyod-Jones' nine reasons not to give an altar call and never gives any biblical reason we should do so.  Dr. Street works from a Baptist theology that ignores election and the work of the Holy Spirit (John 6:44; Acts 14:48) and places the emphasis on man (both pastors and hearers).  He cites not one biblical example of an actual altar call or genuine invitation but uses various Scriptures out of context to try to make his point.  He also gives justification to the sinner's prayer method although he never deals with any Scriptures concerning this matter (since there are none I would expect him to do so).    Overall, unless you are an Arminian in your evangelistic approach, then I would not encourage you to purchase this book.  It offers nothing in the means of theological content.  You would be better to read Iain Murray's book THE INVITATION SYSTEM or John MacArthur's ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS, or HARD TO BELIEVE.  
 This is another Family friendly movie, that my 3 littlest ones just didn't take to.  About have way through, 2 of the 3 were asking to put on Homeward bound instead.  There was a lot I liked about this movie, but my family voted with their feet and remote control.  They are 6 to 10 years old 
 What's up with all these emo bands sprouting out of nowhere? I guess emo is to 2005 what rap metal was to 1999. I'm sure that the emo-originators played with heart, but now we have all these bands, such as My Chemical Romance, The Used, Hawthorne Heights, and Story of the Year, FAKING emotion. Anyone can sing in a high pitched voice, write some whiny lyrics, and convine people it's "nothing but emotion". Yeah, well, if all these people are really this emotionl, America really does have a problem with their youth. Fortunately it's all just show-biz, but if this is the lenghth some people have to go to just for attention, then I'd say America's youth DOES have a problem. Fortunately emo's just another trend and it will be gone and no one will be able to remember what they saw in it, just like people do about Limp Bizkit now days. So go buy a Mastodon CD and listen to some musicians who can REALLY play their instruments 
 The overall story of "Pure," about a girl who becomes addicted to pain , is interesting - but that's about all this book has to offer.   I don't know if young author Rebbecca Ray meant to mimic the poor grammar of a thirteen-year-old girl or if her own writing is just plain bad, but either way this book is painstakingly hard to read. Most of her sentences don't even make sense. For example: "I didn't like Dawn's smile, wandering through to sit next to me." Many times you don't know who's moving or who's speaking because Ray's nouns don't connect to her verbs.   A good editor would do wonders for this novel. If some of the unnecessary poor grammar were fixed and if the mundane, everyday scenes were cut, this book would read a lot better. There are some really great moments in this book (like when the narrator realizes she wants to break up with her first boyfriend). But there is so much garbage between each of these scenes that the passion of the book is lost. The first 100 pages are meant to introduce us to the narrator, her first relationship, and the abuse Robin gives her - but all of this could have happened in 20 pages. There's too much everyday conversations between the narrator and her family and friends that just don't advance the plot. This book needs focus.  If you're a young writer interested in what your peers are writing or if you're looking for experience workshopping fiction, this is an interesting book to read. It demonstrates how a great plot can be lost with poor writing. If you're just a reader looking for something to pass the time, I'd recommend reading something else 
 So I saw this one live action Alice in Wonderland movie and it sucked!!!! But I'm confused this isn't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie, I think it is. I'm not sure if I want to risk boring myself with other crap... so will I watch this verison ever... who knows 
 My daughter can't get on these chairs by herself because they slide out from under her.  I thought it was because the chairs were on hardwood floors.  So, I moved them to the carpet and instead of sliding out from under her, they just fall over the second she touches them.  She got them for her birthday in January and they are going in the yard sale next weekend.  Don't waste your money 
 This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere 
 This book has some great content; however, as a Mac user, I was disappointed that nowhere does the author point out cross-platform differences. I realize Windows is the dominant OS, but Acrobat is just as much (if not more, as a a percentage) used on the Mac. Shame on the author for not even bothering to mention the differences 
 Too many errors in the book, it can cause more frustration and confusion than it is worth 
 This is a Wicca 101 book in disguise.  I have an interest in dream recall, alternate conscious states and lucid dreaming.  This is not what I expected.  This author teaches how to set up an altar, cast a circle and spellcast under the guise of 'dream magic'.  Nice marketing ploy 
 I am totally unimpressed with this set of bowls.  I received them a few days ago and washed them, and one has already managed to crack after falling of the drying rack and into the sink.  A melamine bowl should be far sturdier than this.  The orange measuring cup/bowls towards the center are nice, but the outer bowls are rather flimsy.  
 Just a rehash of the manual.  Practical Poser is a MUCH better book that really takes you through the intricacies of Poser 6.  Poser 6 Revealed basically teaches you the same the the tutorial manual does 
 I didn't like this book. I thought it was a waste of time and money. 
 I purchased this book to read about how Laura Ingalls Wilder became the celebrated author of the Little House series of books.  I was very disappointed, therefore, that this uninsightful, dry, fragmented, and repetitious tome read more like a bad history book with too many statistics, facts and figures, rather than character analysis, leaving me with no more knowledge of Laura's character than before I read it.  For example, after describing ad nauseum all the organizations and activities one could possibly participate in their town, the author states that we do not know if Laura and her family enjoyed any of them. It was frustrating to constantly read the words "probably, maybe, if, we can presume ....."  The author makes too many assumptions and repeatedly expresses his inability to accurately understand and relay Laura's personal feelings due to the unfortunate lack of diaries, letters, and journals left behind by Mrs. Wilder.  Relying too much on her daughter, Rose's writings, he portrays Laura as an overprotective, condescending, controlling mother and a domineering wife who refused to vow to obey her husband during their wedding.  Miller is not quite sure he even believes Rose's unflattering portrayal of her mother, because she was mentally ill and emotionally unstable herself.  This book contains so much one-sided information about Laura's daughter that it should instead be titled Becoming Rose Wilder Lane

 "We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and this blueprint will determine your financial life. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your blueprint isn't set for a high level of success, you'll never make a lot of money-and if by chance you do, you'll most likely lose it!" - T. Harv Eker  Author of the international bestselling book Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker intends to show you how to think and act like a millionaire in the 50-card deck of the same name.  Each colorful card features an affirmation on one side and an expansion of the idea on the other. Some of the messages in the Secrets of the Millionaire Mind Cards include:  "Be the Best at What You Do - To get paid the best, you must BE the best. Rich people are experts in their field, middle-class people are mediocre in their field, and poor people are poor in their field."  "Associate With Successful People - Birds of a feather flock together. The rich associate with successful people, the poor often associate with unsuccessful people. Energy is contagious. If you want to fly with the eagles, you'll have to stop swimming with the ducks."  "Don't Listen to Broke People - Rich people take advice from people who are richer than they are. Poor people take advice from their friends, who are just as broke as they are."  "Embrace Responsibility - Most people run from responsibility-that's why they're broke. Rich people are willing to take on big responsibilities-that's why they're rich."  As you can see, the Secrets of the Millionaire Mind Cards is full of materialistic tripe. Eker tries to add some "spiritual" messages to this deck with cards like "Become Conscious", "Learn to Live in Your Higher Self", and "Enhance Your Energy". However, most of the cards are full of polarizing messages with the dividing line between "rich" and "poor". The assumptions and dualistic philosophy are disturbing. The messages promote an "us versus them" attitude, in addition to focusing on others as both competition and as a measuring stick for "success".  Eker uses the word "success" quite often, and it would appear that his personal standard is the United States. Many of his assertions are so off the mark, it's hard to pick where to start! For example, I grew up in a lower-middle class environment, and my father was the local butcher. He was the best in the area, with many stores trying to lure him away to join their company. His reputation was excellent, he took great pride in his work, always paid the bills, and went to work despite illness. In fact, I remember him going to work with a broken ankle-which wasn't easy considering he spent much of his day in frigid conditions.  However, according to the Secrets of the Millionaire Mind Cards, my Dad lacked responsibility, was "poor" (or "mediocre") in his field, and was a "duck" who didn't deserve to be "swum" with in the pond of life. To be honest, I'm blown away at the shallowness of this deck. I'm even more surprised that Hay House, a company known for creating uplifting, positive, and empowering products would produce such superficial nonsense.  And no, I am NOT opposed to wealth or abundance! Nevertheless, challenging a poverty or scarcity mindset is a whole lot different from castigating the poor and labeling so-called "qualities" of those who are "less than" in the Eker model (i.e. those who aren't "rich"). If one were to take Eker seriously, this would mean that Eckhart Tolle's two year stint as a "homeless" man sitting on a park bench was an indication of a lack of success and vision. Because he wasn't busy "doing" something-competing with everyone and his brother for more-he was low-life failure. Or what about Mother Theresa alleviating the suffering of the poor? She hung with the "ducks"-so what did that make her?   Sorry, but I'd like to choose whom to admire based on qualities I'd like to cultivate and maintain in myself-and those don't include competitiveness (which, unfortunately, I was born with in spades), grasping, comparison, and elitism. In fact, rather than looking outside myself for a rabbit to jump-start or encourage my ambition, I'd rather run the race of my sacred contract which contains lessons unique to my soul. Success and wealth are all relative; plenty of people have gained the whole proverbial world and lost their soul.  If you'd like to make tons of money, be the "best" and first in everything, and climb the social ladder, you'll likely love these cards. If you want a balanced deck that encourages the ideas of abundance without a shallow, materialistic mindset, try Deepak Chopra's Success Cards.  (To 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at JanetBoyer.com)  P.S. I believe in abundance and am not struggling financially. I live an abundant, joy-filled life. :o 
 This magazine should really be titled "Better Living Through Buying Stuff." It's beautifully designed but during the course of my subscription, the only important thing I've learned is how to fold a sweater. I will not be renewing 
 I don't like this CD at all what happeed to the classy Monica???   Too Ghetto.... Such a waste of such a beautiful voice!!   
 Perhaps a better title for this book would have been "Poor Choices". I found this book to be about someone who was quite depressed about life and went from one bad choice to another. There was very little about cycling in the book and the little that was led me to believe that the author doesn't know very much about cycling.  I kept hoping that the character in the book was going to run into a true cyclist who was going to teach him about the sport(how to ride, how to dress, etc.) This however was not the case.  Based purely on this book, I will not read another Greg Garrett novel.   
 For an author who wrote such exceptional novels, I found this to be quite boring. He spent WAY too much (2/3 of the book)on plays, screen plays, directing & producing. Not enough time on the writing of books, since that's what really made him famous( and rich). I would have liked to know more about the back story of his novels; where he got his ideas from, characters & places. 
 If you go to the list showing all of my reviews, you will see that I have read quite a few books about the stock market and trading in general. While I have encountered information that talked in generalities about the Elliott Wave Principle, I had never delved into it in much detail as I never felt the methodology was consistent. Having trudged my way through this book, I have come to the conclusion that either (1) I am too stupid to be able to understand and trade based on the EWP (an admittedly distinct possibility), or (2) I have never read so much after-the-fact 'curve fitting' in my life. If you are a student and believer in the Elliott Wave Principle, this will be like adding a second Bible to your collection. If, however, you don't already know and understand the EWP, and unless you are a genius, plan on spending years trying to understand the theory before you will be able to implement it into your trading system. Sorry, Mr. Prechter, but I just don't get it 
 If you ever wonder why energy workers are stereotyped as newagey, flaky, and also inprecise in how they define energy, i.e. they say energy is in everything, you won't wonder after you read this book. I picked this up on a whim, curious to see if it really offered a break through in energy healing.  There is nothing innovative about this book. You can find the concepts the author discusses in books on taoism and tantra that are better written and have a better explanation.  I tried his exercises out and found them to be not nearly as effective as he promised. If anything it seemed this was more like a diet lite soda than anything that promised a break through. I wouldn't really recommend this book 
 Geesh people...Walmart is not Satan, Barney is not the devil, and Sponge Bob Square Pants is not gay!!!!  I guess the great unwashed public will always have to have a scapegoat for their own inadequacies!!!  Grow up people and try not to blame others for your own faults! 
 No this is not Quantum Physics, this is just another book picking little parts of Quantum Physics, removing all the math, removing a lot of the logic, and adding poetic license.  Look, if you're interested in Quantum Physics, and REAL science, there are plenty of other books that are much better at explaining real Quantum Physics on a level most people understand.  Brian Greene has a couple very good books that do just that, No formuli either.  You may have to look up an occasional word, but if your not willing to do that, I don't understand how you're going to learn anything ever anyways.  This book is much more towards philosophy than physics.  I can agree with the first paragraph, and from there on is philosophy.  And physicists don't have 'faith' particles exist, they know they do from scientific observation.  Billions aren't invested in Particle Accelerators so scientists can get faith, that would be clearly pointless.  I'm working to my Doctorate in Physics, and when they find out I'm primarily interested in Quantum Physics I am too commonly asked what I think about beliefs that are in books like this.  If you read this, you're wasting your time. The only thing it is good for, is for the author who's making money off of whoever is foolish enough to buy it, so please, find a book with real science.  A key way you can tell is real books will often try to explain concepts with examples, the other kind of books explain things with imagery and romanticism.  
 Some how my previous review text got a little glitched up.  But suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut.  The manufacture of these knives is well below the quality I expected ....  It's the first time I;ve been TOTALLY disappointed ....  We're returning the knives because they are not worth the money.  Really, they look great in the picutre, but they are very poor quality.  Why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars 
 Not as good as others out there, especially the Kaizen Event Implementation Manual. No details or real life information 
 "Ten Things I Learned from Bill Porter" is ideal for someone who has seen the TV movie "Door to Door" or is otherwise ALREADY familiar with, and inspired by, the story of Bill Porter.  The book, unfortunately, is poorly written. Each chapter comes across as if it were conceived independently of the others. Biographical information about Bill Porter is repeated numerous times, and a fair amount of time is spent talking about the author's own life issues. Halfway through the book I found myself skimming paragraphs and whole pages, looking to get back to the thrust of the story about Bill Porter.  If you are looking for a biography of Bill Porter, this is not it. If you are very hungry for any additional information about Porter, this book may be worth your time. 
 Overly flowery and melodramatic language predominate in this novel about a dysfunctional family in South Carolina, yet the subject itself, physical and emotional abuse within the family, is poorly explored.  The characters are one-dimensional and inconsistent.  The plot is not very well developed with a number of gaping holes the reader is expected to believe will be understood later, a later that doesn't somehow come, while some preposterous situations are given many pages of romanticized nonsense to fill in the gaps.  I can't imagine where all the good reviews come from because I found this to be a boring and pointless read.  The dreadful ending just caps it all off.  A real waste of time 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 At every turn when I took this book to hawaii I found mistakes in the text, places out of business or not such address. I wasted a lot of time following advice from this book I will never trust a Frommer Guide again. Look elsewhere 
 It did not fit my phone and I was forced to go out and but another one 
 Despite being a comedy show, this turned out to be a rather depressing experience. There were a few amusing bits here and there, mostly there, but the targets of the satire were very lame.  Most of the parodies are from pop culture in the 1990's, so they are extremely dated.  The "Information 411", "90210", and Yakmin Shirmnov sketches were particularly painful to watch, as bad as anything on SNL.  I only made it through the first 8 episodes, and skipped the last 5.  The commentary on episode 8 was more interesting (check out Garofalo screaming how she hated kissing a sock puppet because she hates "sexuality".  I still don't know what she meant by that) than the actual episode.  As we know, Ben Stiller became a star playing neurotic, clumsy nerds, Andy [...] has done a plethora of drugs and seems to be on the path of being the next Courtney Love (in terms of obnoxiousness and drug intake), Janeane does supporting roles in mostly forgettable (and sometimes wretched) films (even though she does have talent), and Bob Odenkirk did Mr. Show and recently (as of November 2006) directed the awful Let's Go to Prison.  The only sketches I remember in which I mildy laughed were the "B Minus Time Traveler" sketch.  Stick with Monty Python's Flying Circus, which is still unsurpassed in sketch comedy.       
 This was not at all what I expected. The format is a bit confusing at first, and the the fact that not one line listed under Mel Brooks was ever spoke by him in a movie just set me off. He wrote the lines, but that's not the point.  In addition, many of the lines are so generic/obscure as to be pointless, uninteresting and thus no fun. There is some interesting stuff, but when we played guessing games from it over the holidays, we quickly lost interest. I would not recommend this book and hope that there is something better out there 
 I've been in the software industry for quite awhile, and I've watched as the personal computer industry evolved from one where there were dozens of machines being sold to consumers down to the two primary platforms of windows and macintosh.  While there is no doubt that the macintosh is the minority platform, there is also no doubt that its continued survival has engendered an unexplained amount of hate from those who are not fans of the machine.   This book, in summary, is the longwinded rant of one such user. As someone who knows first hand a number of the situations covered in the book, and who has a generally solid understanding for situations not covered in the book, I believe the author of this book sat down and wrote it out by himself without any fact checking, without any real interviews (or he ignored or misunderstood the people he interviewed).  There are so many factual errrors in this book, its not funny- -from little things like the years events happened or the locations of companies or the person who held a particular role at a particular time, to grossly innacurate assumptions about things the author could not possibly know-- such as the minutes of boardroom discussions.   This is a smear job, thru and thru, and like most smear jobs its repetitive, self-contradictory, and downright dishonest.  I think the only reason the author has not been sued is that doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves.  Windows fans like to kick apple and the mac, even when they are down.  Windows seems to engender some sociopathic sadism in people.   IF you want to learn more about apple, find another book... this book is just a windows fan bashing steve jobs for having taste 
 i wonder how hard it is to write cover letters when you have the exact qualifications the job is looking for?  well, if you want that question answered go pick up a copy of this book.  the best has to be "chloe jones" on pgs 69-71.  she's looking for a job as a grant administrator.  it's amazing!  her past job was exactly that - a grants admin.  imagine how difficult it must have been to write that cover letter and resume!  the book is full of examples like this, where the person has the exact qualifications for the job.  ryan then uses the all powerful "impact technique", to craft a masterful cover letter.  it's a little suspicious when every cover letter begins with "ten of banking experience", "fifteen years of human resources management", "twelve years of marketing skills", etc. there is hardly anything of substance in this book for people wanting to change careers, people with little work experience trying to break into a desired field, or anyone who does not have the exact job history and skill qualifications for the advertised position.  save your money or else you'll spend "two hours of life wasted" 
 Turn of the Century is so boring and slow moving that it's not worth reading. In the first half of the book, literally close to nothing happens. Added to which, Anderson makes the book so convoluted it's like a badly executed Altman ensemble drama. It's impossible to keep track of all of these characters and formulate a good idea of what they're actually like. Added to which, the highly trumpeted 'Tom Wolfe' style satire in the book is so blunt and obvious that one wonders how many made the connection between Anderson and the esteemed writer of 'Bonfire of the Vanities'. Bottom line: boring, dull and pretty stupid really 
 I think this book has amazing potential- the plot lines are intriguing, and the characters are interesting- but it falls far short of what I anticipated.  Phillips' prose simply does not draw the reader in.  Instead, it is dry and boring, and it becomes incredibly difficult to get through the long, uninteresting passages to find the good parts.  While I think that many readers will enjoy this book because of the powerful plot line, it seemed to me as though the book relied too much on plot and not enough on quality writing 
 The Band deserves a first rate boxed set, and we have seen various greatest hits and other packages.  The problem with this collection, besides its inflated price, is that the two main audiences for this (completists & solid fans) are both poorly served by this bilious box.    Completists will have all of the previously released stuff and will be wasting money on having it all yet again.  Dedicated followers (not fanatics), mainly drawn by the idea of a single source for some of the best released material, will be wasting money on alternate takes and previously unreleased material which just does not live up to the released material.  Remember, there is usually a reason unreleased material was "unreleased."  The book, etc. will sit on the shelf after one read through.   Why did I purchase this?  I am a Band completist - albeit one who feels more than a bit ripped off by this over-inflated marketer's ploy to pull in both segments of the market.    My advice for the 90% of the people who just want a really good Band collection?  Find the out of print two CD set "Kingdom Come," and pick up the "Last Waltz," and you will be MUCH happier, and still several bucks ahead of the game.  
 ReadyMade magazine is full of fun and useful projects, but the ones in this book are tacky and ugly.  The book itself is lovely, but who wants to make a coat rack out of detergent bottles or a chandelier out of cutlery? 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 Dobson has it wrong. Children's susceptibility to God and the attributes of God has to do with rearing them with the love of God in their hearts from the beginning, praying and relying on God, and being taught to please God. Violence begets violence. To spank and be violent toward children is proof of the perpetrator's ignorance of modern scientific evidence that spanking is detrimental to the emotional, physical and spiritual evolution of children. Ignorance begets ignorance, and if you're in charge of children, feeding your mind with ignorance is no benefit to your child 
 Wood is unnecessarily hostile to Franklin, strugling to dispel the images created in the Autobiography rather than understanding their impact and relationship to history.  it is a useful book for raw information, but when it comes to analysis of that information, I put far more stock in H.W. Brands' The First American.  Brands better undertsands Franklin's gradual coming to a democratic consciousness while Wood only finds contradiction in Franklin's change of mind 
 KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!   THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL, ALL, ALL, TIME SINCE THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND BEFORE THAT! IN THEATERS I WAS THE ONLY ONE WATCHING THAT MOVIE AND I FELT LIKE WALKING OUT!! I WANTED TO CRY  :( THE ACTORS STINK ALONG WITH THE PLOT AND 3-D EFFECTS!!!  All I can say is BOOOOOOOOOO THIS MOVIE SUCKS 
 I have two books currently which are much better than this one.  I'm not really interested in spending the next hour of my life typing up a really exhaustive commentary on this book, as this is the first one I've ever done, but I'm just hoping to save you some time and money and I feel very strongly this is a bad book and a waste of your efforts.  It was the required textbook for my Print Production class, and I could've gotten a better understanding of Print Production by sniffing the ink on my local newspaper.  The glossary is substandard, the chapters are, to say the least, hardly informative, and the author is often contradictive of his own statements.  It doesn't seem as though he has an understanding of Print Production at all.  I spent days staring at this book wondering why I didn't understand print, till I realized it wasn't my brain, I had bought a crappy book.  I won't say some of the elements aren't useful, but you'd be better off shopping at the used bookstore by my school, for example, and picking up a used copy for ten bucks.  There will be plenty there.  You can get everything useful in this book from the Graphics Master (a much better book) or any other Print Production book.  Try Kaj Johansen (spelling... sorry) or Adobe's Print Production Guide.  Also, International Paper occassionally prints a guide.  Don't buy this one.  Graphics Master Seven or Eight would be of MUCH more use to you 
 This is a book that only a pedophile would want to read. It is blatent and unappoligetically child pornography. It contains graphic details about the molestation of a 4 year year old boy through his adulthood. This book does not have artistic integrity. It really is just pornography for the sick, sick, sick. When it refers to this repeated molestation by all sorts of women as abuse Irving puts the word abuse in quotations - "abuse." This implies that it is really not abuse, when in fact any sexual contact with four year olds should unequivically be considered molestation and violation and rape of a child. John Irving should have more social responsibility than to put this kind of sewage out there.   I will not finish it. Though, I will try to read future novels as I have long been an avid fan of Iring's work. 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 I read the book in a little over two hours.  In the title, Sterling says he is "envisioning the next fifty years."  In fact the book is little about the next fifty years as it is Sterling's own thoughts about the past fifty years.  In the introduction to the book he presents his "seven novel aspects of the twenty-first century."  He does this using a character from Shakespeare's 'As You Like It'; Jaques, who is best know for his famous lecture, which begins with: "all the world's a stage" and ends with "Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."  It would have been more appropriate if Sterling had used Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing.'  Sterling tells us he is both a Science Fiction writer and a Futurologist.  I know a Futurologist when I see one, and Sterling is no Futurologist 
 This book was suggested to me by a dear friend. Though, the concept of servant leadership is strong, I am sure I don't want to read this book again to understand it.. 
 I HAVE tried 5-htp. It put me in a bad mood when I took it. Simple as that. I am usually very even-tempered and it caused me to have a really short fuse 
 i really decided to buy this book because i wanted to find some activities i could do with my child that would help his development.  but i was disappointed to find out that there was like 3 pages of stuff for children ages 0 to 6 months.  this book was advertised as having stuff from birth to toddler, it shouldn't have misled people about what was in the book.  i mean all there is for under 6 months is some rhymes and a couple of activities.  i thought there was going to be some stuff about activities to help them reach their developmental milestones.  i mean their are probably not many people that don't know the few rhymes and games that are in the book.  
 I received this book to review for a zine I write for, and it was so bad i told the publisher it wasn't worth reviewing. pierce was grandiose at best and just plain crazy at the end, and it really shows here in the jumbled structure and absolute inanity of much of what is included. I was pretty grossed out by his attitude toward women, too. His obsession about all things Japanese was also really tedious. And I LIKED the Gun Club. Reading this book made me think of the book & movie "Being There", in which the main character speaks only in slogans he's heard from television, and those who meet him think he's a genius. What were you thinking, Henry 
 Ann, an aspiring writer, knew of Lucy, an aspiring poet, when the two of them were students at the same college.  Actually, everyone knew of Lucy.  She was the one who'd had cancer as a child and whose chemotherapy treatments had left her with a severely disfigured face that continued to need surgery after surgery until the end of her life.  Lucy was mistreated by her peers when she was a child, but it seemed that for the rest of her life everyone was trying to make up for that cruelty.  She was cheered for and spoken to warmly wherever she went, despite the fact that she seemed to have few redeeming qualities that would make her so popular.  Even Ann admits that she followed the gossip about Lucy's medical condition and she felt close to her even when Lucy had no idea who Ann was.  Ann couldn't be more delighted when Lucy decides to move in with her after college.  She continues to be thrilled and grateful for the rest of Lucy's life, as Lucy drifts through existence, needing constant reassurance that people loved her, that she was beautiful and talented.  She also needs money, and someone to clean her apartment, and someone to do her bidding after her surgeries.  That person is always Ann, who seems to simply accept that this is the way their relationship should be.  I was confused.  How could an intelligent, educated person allow herself to be treated so poorly?  What was Ann getting out of this relationship that I couldn't see?  Or was it simply that she befriended someone prone to depression and suicide attempts, so she felt she couldn't drop Lucy without putting her life in danger?  Ann is a much better friend than I could ever imagine being; I would have stopped speaking to Lucy after about the fiftieth page 
 After reading this title in an undergraduate philosophy class, and reading it carefully and thoroughly, I feel confident giving it a bad review.  It was selected by the professor, who I assume is a fan, but I know I, and all my friends in class, extremely dislike this book.  I'm a very strong student, an environmentalist, and whatever else you think I need to be a credible reviewer, but this book is very un-engaging.  If you're a professor yourself, I urge you not to use it in class.   The arguments are at times internally inconsistent (the author feels comfortable negating opponents for using the same argument structures she later uses), hyperbolic (the author creates extensive yet repetitive lists of victims of various injustices, redundantly reclassifying the same individual in several ways to make the list longer), and on and on.   The nail in the coffin, from a student's point of view, is that it does so in an extremely boring manner.  I feel bad that the first review is such a negative one, but from the eye of a undergrad, it's a really bad book.  Hopefully a professional philosopher can be more constructive, but undergrad students (its a class for majors and non-majors, to fill a core requirement) are not an appropriate audience for this book 
 The first Nora Roberts novel I read was Northern Lights, and I was pleasantly surprised by the strong sense of locale, interesting and believable characters, and a well-crafted and exciting plot.  Angels Fall sounded like it would follow in the same genre, but it is more a gushy romance novel than a thriller.  This time the hick town location is cliched and dull, as are the characters (especially the heroine).  I started this book on a ten-hour plane trip, and put it down after a couple hours.  A month later I'm still only half way through it; in the last ten chapters not much has happened.  
 now, if we're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts, but maybe just because people are lowering their standards. Besides, the fact that I dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges, this CD is no "Dangerously in Love". Where Beyonce's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album, Cole's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me. Aside from the obvious car banger  "I Just Want It to Be Over" and the wildly popular "Love"(which Cole butchers when singing live by the way),nothing here surprises me.  Like I said , you can call me a hater, but with women like Beyonce and Fantasia around Cole's fire will probably be put out soon 
 Sure, the plot lines are more than a little strange, and I do not mean strange in a good way, but has no one else noticed how unbelievably CLUMSY this book is? I kept reading because one of the plot lines (the more serious one--with the bald fugitive) dragged me along. But it was doggone hard to deal with the style. Maybe I should say lack of style, unless a surfeit of exclamation points counts as "style." I've read Wambaugh's nonfiction in the past, and I've never found it to be particularly ineptly written. Maybe I stumbled on books he spent some time polishing, I dunno. But this book is a wreck. There isn't a graceful descriptive sentence in it, and the dialogue is almost unbearable. Even if it had been well-written, it would be pretty hard to enjoy a book where the dog is the only truly appealing character 
 To give this 'book' to a child should be considered abuse. Communist propogranda disguised as an innocent book about a fish. 
 Considering that the ID movement pretends to be science-based and unconcerned with religion, their propensity for publishing with evangelical publishers certainly is odd isn't it 
 I have no idea where the Velvet Underground comparisons come from in relation to Luna.  The singer resembles Lou Reed only in the sense that he occasionally (actually, more than occasionally) sings off-key, but he sounds an awful lot more like an upper west-side latte wimp, than Lou Reed's late 60s, early 70s Alphabet City junkie.  The music is tuneless (actually, Tiger Lilly is mildly catchy, but that's about it) and has none of the noise or melodic stylings of VU.  In short, they sound like a very watered down Galaxy 500.  There's so much worthwhile music out there--I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this bland, boring, arthritic stuff 
 I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper 
 I bought it given reviews by others, but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it hasn't worked ever since.  I'd suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works 
 I was MISLEAD by the title of this listing, since there is no picture I thought it was an actual textbook, only softcover.  When it arrived it turns out to be a study guide to the textbook!?  I am a struggling college student and I lost $45 shipped on this one.  (you dont need the study guide unless you have money to burn and and dont know how to take notes in class;p) I had to buy the hardcover textbook of course, another hefty $120 at the time...good going amazon, next time put a picture, or dont offer it for sale 
 The first thing that came to mind as I trudged through Macintyre's wordy book was how could something called "concise" seem so long? This book is informative but entirely humorless, like reading an ingredient list. Macintyre seems more concerned with showcasing his vocabularity then with enticing you with the facinating history of Australia's past. There is plenty of information in this book if you can make it through to the end while maintaining consciousness. If you are about to visit Australia and you are looking for an entertaining and informative book to stimulate your enthusiasm I strongly recommend Bill Bryson's In a Sunburned Country. If you are looking for a strong sedative then this is the book for you.  
 I bought this book after seeing Mr Florida talk on CSPAN-2. He does have some interesting things to say about creativity, but...  I found it very difficult to finish.  Mr Florida claims to be politically independent, but he doesn't even hesitate to engage in the sort of casual Bush bashing one see's only in the extreme left, and along with this he repeats almost every silly platitude of same, including the ridiculous "pentagon holding a bake sale to buy a bomber" bit.  If he's politically independent, then I'm the King of Siam.  And his solution? right out of the leftists playbook, we have to spend more, lots more, way more than we ever have, "several orders of magnitude more" on "education", "culture" and "the arts."  Anyone interested in buying a used book? Only read once.. 
 Unfortunately, Malphurs has again published a book that far underestimates his readers.  Advanced Strategic Planning does little more than lay out the basics of strategic planning; issues of greater consequence are left  untouched.  Dealing with entropy in an organization is a serious issue that  Malphurs seems to believe goes away if one's vision/goals/strategy are  rightly aligned.  I was disappointed with this book.  Better to wait for  Post-Advanced Strategic Planning 
 I know he's a famous "name-it-and-claim-it" preacher, so I wanted to see his thoughts exactly, rather than sit through some rambling sermons of his and get pieces here and there.  That's the great thing about books- preachers have to be concise and to the point.    I discovered he is teaching something I never heard before.  First, let me say that he acknowledges some truthful teachings.  He acknowledges that we are not to be greedy.  He acknowledges that Jesus said to store our treasure in heaven, not earth.  He acknowledges that there is nothing evil about money, but the "love of money" is what is evil (although, I think prosperity teachers like himself are deceived; they are in love with money, which is evident by seeing their lifestyles).  And, by the way, there is much in his book that is very good.  I only want to point out some of the dangerous errors.  And here it is:    He says that we are not to store treasure on earth, but in heaven.  That is true.  The Scripture says it.  But look at what he says that means.  He says that the storehouse for our treasure is in heaven, not the earth (not in banks).  When you need money, you can get it when you want, from God, from our heavenly storehouse.  There's no need to store it here (on earth), where robbers and thieves can get to it.      According to Copeland, how do you make deposits and withdrawals from this treasure bank in heaven?     From pages 63-75, he says how to make deposits.  These include (his words for the subheadings in this section):  -- Tithing (I this this is, by far, the most important) -- Giving to the Poor -- Investing in the Gospel -- Giving as a Praise to God    From pages 75-86 he explains how to make a withdrawal.  In the summary for making a withdrawal, he lists 6 points, culminating in a prayer that summarizes these points.  Here's his prayer from page 85-86:  "Father, in the Name of Jesus, we ask you for $____.  We have this money in our heavenly account and we are withdrawing this amount now.  We believe we receive $____.  As in Mark 11:23-24, we believe it in our hearts and confess now that it is ours in the Name of Jesus.  We agree that we have $____ according to Matthew 18:19.  From this day forward, we roll the care of this over on You and thank You for it.  Satan, in the name of Jesus, we take authority over you; we bind your operation now and render you helpless.  Ministering spirits, we charge you to go forth and cause this amount to come to us according to Hebrews 1;14.  Father, we praise Your Name for meeting our needs according to Your riches in glory by Christ Jesus and for multiplying our seed for sowing in the Name of Jesus."     I have just two questions for Pastor Kenneth Copeland:  1. Do you really live by these principles? Do you have a significant savings account and/or retirement bank account? According to your book, you shouldn't, if you really believed what you wrote.  2. Why didn't the first disciples and Apostles living in Jerusalem know this "secret" about heavenly "deposits" and "withdrawals?"  They were so poor and in hardship that the Apostle Paul went around making a special collection for them from the other Roman churches, as mentioned in 2 Cor. 8 and other passages.  In fact, why didn't any other theologians ever teach this heavenly deposit and withdrawal system?  Shouldn't that be a hint to you that you are going off into the deep end???!!!   
 I have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money.  Every other page is a sales page and after paying $300 plus for the application and another $200 for the payroll, now I have to pay if I want their help.  It is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money, no longer has anything to do with their customers. And this customer will not be one next year 
 I have been a musician and writer for over 50 years, and glory of glories, in Whitney Balliett's book, American Musicians II, he achieves perfect pitch in his prose when capturing the heart and soul of what music is, and the men and women who make it happen. His stories pulse with an energy that is seemingly boundless.  Here is a man who has somehow gotten inside these legendary figures, some of whom I knew and many of whom I've heard in person. Balliett lets you listen through his own ears, giving you a guided tour not only of the notes on the page, and then as they take flight in the air, but also of the fascinating daily lives of these gifted individuals.  I can't play like Art Tatum, but Balliett lets me sit beside him as he lays down his "perfect storm" of notes, at the end of which is this huge rainbow whose image we carry in our mind forever.  If you love good music and good writing, you've come to the perfect book.  Balliet is no longer with us, but he has left us a legacy that should be treasured for 32 bars unto infinity.

 I was urged by my uncle to read this piece of conspiracy tell-all. I found it interesting to say the most but tossed it aside as fiction. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. However, it's very fun to read about our imminent  destruction because of the illuminati and their control over the world.  It's even very laughable when you read secret lists of people behind these  conspiracies that only Mr. Marrs has access to. If you want to believe that  we're all going to die soon and that the Great Tribulation is staring at us  straight in the face, sure, read this book- you'll have fun and probably be  convinced. But if you'd rather live out the remainder of your life in  peace, read this book and laugh 
 I have been readung daily meditations/modivational readings for as long as I can remember.  I find this this is probably the most useful in that it covers all aspects of one's life.  I find myself unconsciously nodding my head as I read.  I would highly recommend this book to all of my friends.  It is amazing how much better your day is when you get your brain primed early in the day 
 If this man took a the time to know the history of U.S. involvment in Panama he would know that it was the U.S. that put Noriega in power in the first place.it was also the U.S. that killed the previouse leader of Panama,Omar TorriJos.Who apposed U.S. control of his county.  The united states has used Panama for its own gains without regard for the freedom or rights of the Panamanian people since the take over of the country by President Roosevelt in 1903. One of many good books about the truth of Panamanian History is by John Perkins "Confessions of an Economic Hitman" 
 There are only 1 or 2 short topless scenes and a few crappy death scenes. The death scenes are boring and plain. This movie had so much promise but fell so short. I wouldn't watch it this movie on cable let alone pay for it 
 People like bunker2k1 sicken me, talking about peace and then turning around and saying how much he enjoys Burning books. The fact is that the Acult is no different then most other religions. Christianity its self is the largest Acult. So before you start preaching about peace and Jesus Why don't you look into the history of Christianity. You will then see the Purest of all evil. Wonder why its the most excepted religion? Lets see because The Christian faith was a plague across the land killing entire villages of people and converting all it can. You where told to drop your faith and except Christ. This is the reason today it is where it is. Not because of love or peace but with murder,hate and the idea of having everyone believe in the same thing. If you look at history where do you see devil worshippers or witches even killing 1% of the people that Christians, catholics do. they don't, its a fear tactic to make people believe their is a "DEVIL" Around every corner to keep people believing in the lie. So you can Pray to your GOD of false LOVE believing their is a devil and the acult is out their waiting to take you and your children, Or you can open your eyes do some research and you will find out Christian based religions are the Acult you place so much fear into

 Looking for a bit of sea adventure?  Fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them?  Well don't go looking to Redmond O'Hanlon's "Trawler".  O'Hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects - trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas - and blends them into a putrid stew of nothingness.  This is a very difficult book to read. Physically difficult! Aye!  O'Hanlon's pointless, manic use of exclamation and emphasis - EMPHASIS! Aye! - lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story, it's really no loss.  "Trawler" dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel.  I found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by O'Hanlon.  Aye!  I won't!  Never! 
 okay, hear goes...being the first one to bring to the consumers attention of this recording being incomplete. its still INCOMPLETE !!!! with that.. i'll tell you.. the rest of the recording is fine!! but the fact of the matter remains with reviewer's from ma, to nj, making explainations or excuses for an unfinished product its still INCOMPLETE. being one who so looked forward to this cd i about did cartwheels when i found this at the the store ...could hardly wait to get home and listen to the MAIN TITLE!! after all this was the main feature of the cd , the big cheese, the head honcho of the whole bunch,but was dissapointed to find THE DULCIMER  track was indeed missing !!!so for you folks out there with no musical inclinations, hear are the fact's in musical terms. the MAIN TRACK ( meggies theme )starts with 4 measures of music with smaller amounts of music like autoharp included, then there are 4 measures of music with the  DULCIMER TRACK  that SHOULD be there ,followed by 2 measures again without the dulcimer and again it repeats this with 4 more measures of music with the  DULCIMER TRACK  followed by 2 measures of less forceful music before it then crecendo's to the full orchastra of the 2nd half of MEGGIES THEME in the main title. so any amount of reasoning by folks who do not know what they are talking about , SIT DOWN, LISTEN , KEEP QUIET  AND PAY ATTENTION!!!! besides how dare they mess up meggies theme!!!!   and now you know ...the rest of.. the story 
 banal, derivative, overproduced tripe.  whiney, lame, stupid vox/lyrics. a country-inflected KILLERS--i.e. soul-less corporate rock gone trendy (read "alt-country" wannabes with My Bloody Valentine fantasies).    Sub Pop, whence the spate of horribly BORING records.  i've not bothered to list song tracks cause they're really undeniably samey, these songs--one after an irksome other.  don't waste money--buy GOOD RECORDS:  yo la tengo, sparklehorse, the black watch, the radio dept.  all put out excellent albums this year.  investigate 
 I have not received this order yet. I am contacting the supplier now 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 This book is utter drivel from the first line of the first page to the very end 
 Dreadful - even the actors looked embarrassed. The only part worth seeing was the swearing autoteller. Other directors of dogs like this have the sense to save themselves shame by hiding behind the Alan Smithee psuedonym - what a pity Mr. King didn't. Just awful 
 I recorded this film off of the IFC and watched it all the way through.  My only reward for this act is that I will never have to do it again.  I was initially intrigued by the film because it starred Sarah Polley of "The Road To Avonlea" fame, and I thought that the plot synopsis sounded interesting.  I still think that the raw material was very good, but The Sweet Hereafter has to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen.  The pace was so slow and so drawn out that I found myself wanting it to be over.  I think that this film is an example of what happens when depth and character analysis run amok and take over the film.  The Sweet Hereafter has so much depth and so much character analysis, nuances, and points of view that it is weighed down to the point of stagnation.  The film is so heavy that it cannot even prop itself up on a pillow.  I give it only two stars, one for Ian Holm and one for Sarah Polley.  You could pass this one by and you wouldn't miss anything.        
 I'm searching the web trying to figure out how to get blue moonsand color out of my carpet.  My kids like it and it is pretty cool, but whatever you do, don't let your kids play with it over carpet.  I figured I could just vacuum it up, but if the kids have stepped in it and smushed it into the carpet, good luck!  I'm upset right now, because I've spent 1/2 an hour with my carpet cleaner trying to get the blue out of my light tan carpet.  That's the only complaint I have.  Only play with this stuff outside and be careful not to track it into the house.  
 An 18th century author writing about the dark ages. It reads more like incidents within a narrative rather than a single story.  I found the ending abrupt and not credible. I expected more of the creator of Sherlock Holmes 
 Davis just plain misses the point.  Let's be clear: I didn't say Davis didn't throughly examine the subject as a historian; I said he missed the point -- right over the head, so-to-speak. Just as the Bible says that God is revealed and understood through faith, not scientific or historical evidence Davis has evidently attempted to examine the "intent" of the founders through "secular eyes." Since the Bible also says we humans have only two choices available (regardless of opinion on the matter). We are either on one side or the other -- God's or the devils.  Guess who's doing the examination here 
 The good ideas in this book would have made a great magazine article, but that's about it. I have all of the other Shabby Chic books and I love them, but this one was a big letdown. I couldn't believe there was a chapter on how to decorate your kid's lunch! Another thing--the publisher calls this a hardcover, but it's not 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it 
 What we have here is a leftist author who believes the way to fix all racial problems is for everybody to accept his policy prescriptions.  He thinks white conservative Christians, although showing little racial animus toward blacks, are "part of the problem" because they don't accept his particular political views.  This bias taints any insightful parts of the book 
 This book has little story and a lot of bad porn. Read only if you are into fairy sex 
 Roth consulted some records but apparently failed to understand the the explicit meaning of forced conversion.  This work is an example of failing to use the whole record for an accurate conclusion.  There many are inquistion records, especially in the New World, of Jews clinging to the faith of their fathers and dying in inquisitional flames as a result.  Also, the Amsterdam Jewish community was established by Crypto-Jews this author contends didn't exist.  This blatant failure to get the facts right leads one to believe that Roth either has a hidden motive or is incompetent beyond belief 
 I knew before I started reading Candice Bushnell's Sex and the City it was not the HBO series, so that wasn't a surprise. What was a surprise is that this so-called "author" is about as literary as a discarded apple core. There's nothing smart nor funny in this book. Bushnell's writing is flat, lifeless, and dull. This book does nothing but cast a spotlight on the empty, materialistic, shallow, insecure lives of New York's wealthy and "beautiful people." She never casts an opinion about these pathetic souls, so you're constantly asking the question, why should I care about any of these characters. Not one character has a redeeming quality, and poor Carrie is portrayed as a self-involved, border-line alcoholic--no wonder no one wants her. Not one character in Sex and the City is interesting, witty, or even identifiable with anyone who doesn't share the same shallow emptiness. The only thing the book imparts is a grateful feeling that you are not one of these pathetic losers. I'm grateful that Darren Star and Michael Patrick King were able to transform this piece of garbage into a witty, vibrant, sexy television series that will be remembered far longer than this wretched piece of effluvium 
 I'm no genius in RF Engineering but I have come across a lot of good Microwave Engineering books and this is NOT one of them. More to the point, I work entirely with other RF engineers and every person I showed this book to shuddered and began spouting off profanities at it.   Although the book does start out simply enough, the chapters tend to give only a brief overview of the material. The real trouble starts when you try to work the problems at the end of each chapter. With no solid examples or clear explanations of how to proceed, I found myself referring to my other RF textbooks for support.  I have no doubt that if you are borderline Genius, this book will make perfect sense to you. ...But for us less than genius personality types, keep looking, your book is still out there 
 Don't know why my first note hasn't appeared, so I'll briefly restate. the claim-to-fame of this film is it's avant-garde, push-the-envelope sexuality. Amazon describes this film as "Unrated", but that's not what nearly all of these listings are selling. These are the new "R" Rated version that is MASSIVELY redacted. In fact, all of what makes this film famous has been reduced to some brief nudity. Even though the box continues to bill it as "The sexiest movie ever made." On top of that, despite an English only cover, my VHS purchase was subtitled in SPANISH. The seller has offered an adjustment. He didn't know. But Amazon needs to drop the 'Unrated' description, as that implies the original. Those still interested might look for something like a 'director's cut'. I still haven't found one. Sorry if this is a duplicate of previous post 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 32 000 photos to choose from, and this is what he comes up with?? Many of the pictures are black and white, out of focus and grainy. The panorama shots are very poorly composited from smaller pictures. I’ve seen much better seamless versions of the same photo series in other books. Numerous pages are simply empty. Just black. There are many great photos in this book, but they are too few to make it a good buy. A few google searches will turn up many more great photos than you will find in this book.  
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 [...] This movie was simply boring. The content obviously had potential to be exciting but the director, writer and actors felt the need to proselytize instead of telling a good story. Admittedly I haven't read the book version but I did recognize Kirk Cameron doing his Way of the Master evangelical schtick in the middle of the movie trying to convince a "sinner" that he was no good.  If one of the goals of this movie is to convince nonChristians of Christ's imminent return than the movie fails because even while I'm up on some of the end time paranoia the movie itself is very confusing and the subplot of "Buck" getting involved with a jealous Christian girl is worse than a Growing Pains sitcom scenario.  But the greatest "sin" of this movie was that it was boring. And I'm not against Christian movies per se as long as they're entertaining or so bad that they're still entertaining. I mean the original Left Behind dragged in parts but at least it was amusing. This was one was just a snore. And that's a shame because I don't see how this end time paranoia should be boring. It should be thrilling and enjoyable. I think the problem may be that Christian directors/writers don't know or are afraid to present evil as evil. That may require language, nudity or gory violence. Because evil interests us. The figure who is the anti-christ is about as evil as a corrupt CEO--evil enough, but it's all paperwork and business meetings. For God's sake, he's the Anti-Christ, he's the rockstar among religous figures and the evil that he does in this movie is to censor GNN News. Yawn. 
 When purchasing audiobooks, I normally follow a simple but very effective rule: never, never, never buy an audiobook read by the author. Even if the author is a talented writer, he/she is invariably a terrible narrator. Always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers, as in Bryson's own "Notes From a Small Island" and "A Walk in the Woods", read by Ron Mclarty.  In Bryson's case I made a rare exception when I listened to "In a Sunburned Country" - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining. For this reason I assumed that "Neither Here Nor There" would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong. Bryson's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book. Passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone. The sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of "In a Sunburned Country" is totally lacking. I would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia 
 He doesn't deserve that Nobel.... It was a political decision 
 I'm glad that I got this book out from the library instead of buying it. It provides extremely conventional advice about self-esteem and makeup, and the clothes the author suggests for teens seem like they're straight from the 80's. I really don't know anyone who wears scarves, overalls, or blouses to school. The language and general writing style of the author also seems outdated. I actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a 90's book; it's a 2000 book. Ms. Youngs even uses the 80's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors. It's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one's looks and "beauty diversity", yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls. The author herself was a Miss Teen Claifornia finalist, so I suppose one couln't expect much more. I would avoid buying this for a young girl, or avoid buying it for yourself if you are a young girl 
 I was really looking forward to using this book on our next trip to Paris, until I read the section in which it defines Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National party as an "extremist, racist party". I mean, after the events over the past year (car burnings, riots, cartoons, etc) it would behoove Mr. Steve's to pray that Le Pen's party wins the next election, or he will be writing a book on how to speak Arabic instead of Frenc 
 He manages to do nothing but try to reinforce the same sterotypes about the sexes of Gray and Gurian.The same tired  myths "men look for beauty" and women "power,money and strength" are a theme of the book.I have read many books about  gender and they smack of agenda and recycling of sterotypes. Don't waste your money.Better yet don't waste your mind on this nonsense.The right wing has an agenda to keep the status quo, to undermine women and keep all men in the shackles of power even if they don't want it in many individual cases.He doesn't want women to have any aggression,power or status and uses  myths to help his sorry cause 
 This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it 
 Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.  I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 With Edward McGee's whiny vocal arrangements coupled with lyrics such as, "I can't stand to see the slaughter, but still I eats the meat", this album's "chops" are nothing but mindless butchery. The  torture continues with sappy tracks like "You Ought to be Having  Fun" and "Make Someone Happy". What would truly make me  happy is throwing this album into a bonfire and roasting it to a crisp,  golden brown. Eating this tainted "meat" will leave you with a  bad taste in your mouth. Bon Appetite  
 I have an unusual setup:  I have a g4 laptop and a dell tower, both hooked up to 2 evoluent vertical mice (one left handed, one right handed), a microsoft ergo keyboard 4000, and a wacom intuous 3.  The tablet simply does not work when connected through the kvm.  One of the mice consistently dies when connected through input 1.  Periodically, the other mouse will die and the dead one will revive when switching.  un plugging and re plugging brings them back.  My mac can't recognise the microsoft keyboard through input 1, even though there is a driver installed for it, and it recognizes it when it is directly connected.  Ocaisionally, the screen corrupts, switching back and forth fixes it...  If you have a fancy setup like mine with lots of sensitive input devices, splurge for something a little nicer 
 Pure trash.  Absolute nonsense.  Dr. Greer has embarassed himself.  Save your money 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the author's earlier work on how the Irish saved civilization.  But this book was a disappointing compendium of Greek myths, legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book.  Taken in its subparts, many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose.  Yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight.  Where's the big picture?  The author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the Greeks' "variety of human response, lightening quick transmutations, resourcefulness, and inexhaustible creativity."    A subtitle like "A Greek Treasury of Personal Vignettes" might have been more descriptive and merited another star. But it falls short as a "hinge of history" with impoverished and even maladaptive connections (FDR as Solon - really?) to the modern world. I am sorry to not recommend it. 
 The Secular Squeeze:  Reclaiming Christian Depth in a Shallow World.  What a fantastic title, I thought to myself as I snatched the book from the bookshelf at my local Christian bookstore and raced hurriedly to the checkout counter.  I could hardly wait to get back home to my easy chair and begin reading this tome that seemed to echo my take on modern civilization in These United States.  I was anxiously looking forward to partaking of the views, insights and philosophy of a person who would be so moved as to write a book such as this.  Sadly, after completing the book, some 307 pages later, I'm still waiting.  What a letdown.  With such an incredible piece of subject matter, how could a book such as this not be exciting?  Well, truth be told, it was as flat and shallow as the secular world it was trying to describe.  Yes, modern society has lost its spiritual base and is totally caught up with the acquisition of things and the idea that "it is not enough for me to succeed, you have to fail", but there was little more than cursory reference made to this. Mostly the book was made up of weak analogies and philosophies run wild.  If reference was made one more time to Andy Wharhol's paintings of soup cans, or Arnold Schwarzenegger or Julia Roberts as being symbols of what is right and what is wrong with modern civilization, I think I would have screamed.  The Schwarzenegger ("Total Recall") and Roberts ("Pretty Woman") references were meant to mean their movies I gather, but the reference was to them as people rather than actors playing roles.  Schwarzenegger was depicted as what is wrong with society, when in fact he would be a stellar role model for anyone.  He has a good marriage, great kids and is a good citizen.  Julia Roberts on the other hand was depicted as what is right.  Am I missing something here?  She's a good actress, but has had serious problems with relationships.  Then again, elsewhere in the book, the references to these two seems to flip flop.  But flip flopping seems to be a major problem with the book.  Every time I thought I'd caught on to where the book was heading, it doubled back and ran in the opposite direction.  The author got so caught up in right-brained/left-brained diatribe that I often lost the point of what he was saying - but maybe that's because I'm just to the left of middle-brained and don't look at any one thing from totally one perspective.  The author also needs to understand that many words do not a point make.  Over three hundred pages of utter drivel could have been reduced to about twenty pages of possibly meaningful dialog - I think.  In short, John F. Alexander, do us all a favor.  Please don't write a sequel 
 I have a pretty decent computer (Athlon64/3000+, Radeon X550), but this game does not work at all.  Even after I download and install the patch from Aspyr (though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box), spellforce.exe just sits there and sucks up 99% of the CPU until I kill the process.  Aspyr support is unable to help.  That said, despite other reviews here, this game does NOT install Starforce.  But maybe that's why my version won't work.. 
 Fred Barnes used to be a smart man -- rather conservative for my tastes, but not unintelligent.  But this book is nothing more than hagiography -- it reminds of Henri Barbusse's book on Stalin, which informed guillible readers that the Leader sometimes went down to help unload the docks when nobody was looking.   The book is shockingly one-sided -- Baby Bush can do no wrong.   It's been a long time since a semi-respected author has glorified a war criminal so passionately.  
 I counted ~15 factual errors (aka lies) during Michael Moore's opening speech.*  I stopped shortly after.  I'm not going to waste my time on such obviously factually-wrong fiction.  How stupid does Mr. Moore think we are?  I was *there* watching the election unfold, and what he reported is NOT what happened.     * Example: He said FOX News pressured NBC, cbs, abc, and cnn to change their minds, and give Florida to Gore, and then Bush.  What a load of lies.  FOX news has no power over the other nets.  NBC, cbs, abc, cnn operate independently, and reached their decisions independently, without influence from Fox.  * And furthermore, the other nets did NOT call for bush (as Moore falsely claimed).  They labeled Florida "undecided", and left it that way for several days.  * Also, Moore claimed that a recount showed Gore won Florida.  FALSE.  A bipartisan committee counted the votes a few months later, and not only did Bush win, but the recount *increased* his lead from a few hundred to several thousand, because of conservative communities in western Florida.  (Many other non-biased groups found the same result.)   This video reminds me of his Columbine documentary, where men's ties kept changing colors in the middle of their speeches (it's called creative editing).   Moore has no ethics.  Propagandist.  As far as I'm concerned, he's no better than a KKK member.   Same mental disorder & illogic.    
 Overall it is a fairly good album.  Marques Houston has grown into a fine young man.  I am just as old as Marques Houston so I can remember his Immature days.  In my opinion, there are very few songs that are worth being listened to over and over and some that are not.  The tracks that I like are as follows:  1-All because of You 2-Sex Wit You 3-Marriage 5-Naked 6-Do You Mind 11-Everything  
 While some of the fundamental dietary changes that this book suggests are very helpful to many individuals to alleviate symptoms, the alkalizing diet is nothing more than a bandaid or a temporary fix.  In a healthy individual, the body is able to properly regulate pH itself.  Furthermore, there are many  diverse underlying causes and pathways to IC, and it is my belief that every patient requires individualized treatment.  My symptoms went from mild to unbearable after several months of following Amrit's standard regimen.  I urge you to proceed with caution.    
 I recently purchased this DVD recorder from Best Buy. It was an open item so I got it for a good deal. Initially after I set it up I was pretty happy, after I started watching tv and recorded a show, I realized I got a piece of junk on my shelf.   It looks good and the hardware is high quality. But here are the bad points.  1. It takes a very long time for the recorder to turn on, and almost 15 seconds to eject a DVD.   2. The display that says what show is on and what channel it is reappears every 5 seconds.   3. I recorded 24 last night, and tried to watch it later. While it says in the manual and I know that some programs are copy protected, 24 was protected for almost 70% of the show. It wasn't normal increments either. It was totally random. Most of the show was cut out, and I just saw a grey blank screen.  Overall, I was extremely frustrated with this dvd recorder. Its possible it was just a bad unit but regardless I just went and exchanged it for the Panasonic DMR- ES15. 
 Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man understands women! The only woman who could be 'explained' by this nonsense is one who's been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy, and there are quite a few of that type in America (and in Saudi Arabia, and in Afghanistan, and ....).   For a book that does explain women, to both women and men, see Simon de Beauvoir's 'The Second Sex'. Excellent text, I've read and reread it many times, with greeat benefit. 
 I was disappointed in this book for all the reasons mentioned by Ms. Janis. All of her comments ring true, everyday. I too remember articles about losing at tennis or "50 ways to make him happy" published in magazines of my youth.  I also remember being told that if I wanted to find a man, I had to be less-smart and ditch my glasses. Well here I am, new to the 50 Club, still wearing glasses and smarter than ever! If my only chance for finding romance with a man who may have ED, looks as bad as Jack Nicholson did in "Something's Gotta Give" and is hooked on Viagra  - I'll stay home and watch old movies on TCM. In short, why should I sacrifice who I am and bother with the face-lifts, new teeth and other false-hoods that society still fosters when all men over 50 want is a younger woman who will boost their image and ego. Amen 
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 Do not buy this if you want an overview of mammalian evolution.  Most of the text is devoted to the humans that found the first mammalian fossils and how they inspired the AGE OF MAMMALS mural at the Peabody Museum.  A great deal of the text is quotes of early paleontologists (Owen, Cope, Marsh, et al.), and when the actual mammals are mentioned, the reader is referred to the mural.  Unfortunately, if you haven't committed the mural to memory, or you haven't studied mammalian evolution, you may have a tough time following the text, as there are few illustrations.  If you are interested in the history of the discovery of these early mammal fossils, you may enjoy this book more than I.  If, however, you are more interested in the evolution and systematics of those mammals, you may want to reconsider.  In fact, I would recommend searching for a more thorough text(s) regarding these paleoworkers.  There are other books that examine the Cope and Marsh battle from a broader platform, and there are numerous biographies of Owen, Huxley, Darwin, Cuvier and other covered in this book.  This is not a book worthy of a paleontologist's library, but your local library should have a copy 
 This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money 
 It's sort of sad that a book being advertised as being  "Completely Revised" is completely the same. Even the date on the CD is 2003! I have the version for Illustrator CS and nothing has been changed between the two volumns, NOTHING! So save yourself some money and buy the version for Illustrator CS if it available. I'm so mad that I purchased this book I could scream. But instead I'm just going to rate the book with a big, fat one star. Maybe the author will get a clue for her next version 
 Let's look at the Target Audience and why they will not buy this book. I am an unbeliever, or better yet an Apostate. When I read what this book was about, I laughed. It is obvious that what he is doing is highly speculative and forbidden within a Calvinist framework. 'The *secret* things belong to the Lord." As has been said, Superstring theory is not even a proven concept yet, like Evolution is. Even if it was, it would be dangerous for bible believing Christians to define the Trinity, the Incarnation, or other *anomilies* (contradictions) within the framework of Superstring Theory. What would be the connection? There is no way you can take the ancient *formulas* that attempt to make sense of the above doctrine of God and *make them fit* into a *naturalistic* explanation for God. If Superstrings can be proven, then they fall into the natural realm of the Universe. If you can *contain* God in a well defined dimension, then you have a naturalistic, and thus limited God. He would be no longer Omnipresent, Omnipotent and all those other things you like to ascribe to him.  Though I appreciate the attempt to make sense out of God through science, this approach has obvious pitfalls. Perhaps someone can state the case better then I can, since I honestly do not understand superstring theory, but I do understand that if we can find other diminsions in our universe, they would have a naturalistic character to them, and then by definition, God would be *contained*.  Bottom line, what he is saying is wishful saying and unscriptural. The bible doesn't even hint at fanciful scientific theories. The bible isn't a science textbook.  In fact, the bible cannot answer simple questions like if God said, be fruitful and multiply to all the creatures he created on that first week that more then 90% of all species are already extinct. I guess they didn't obey him??? 
 I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie. 
 If Hillary's a cult leader, then where's her cult? Because I'm one of the ones Rush, Hannity, Coulter and the rest would have you believe are scheming in the shadows for Hillary's overthrow of apple pie, baseball, and mothers.  I'm one of the wingnuttiest of the wingnuts (or is that "moonbattiest" of the "moonbats?" I get all of these childish epithets confused).  And as wingbatty as I am, I can't stand her.  I understand (disagree with, but understand) the suspicion of Soros.  Big money colluding behind closed doors with influential and powerful politicians.  But this isn't a liberal conspiracy; if you'll just read a gosh darn newspaper, you'll find it's a conservative reality (KBR, the Northern Mariana Islands, seriously, look 'em up).   What I don't understand is how Hillary has achieved boogeyman status.  Like I said, I'm one of the supposed leftist zombies you've been warned about and I'm far from alone in my distaste for and distrust of Hillary.  The only people whispering conspiratorially of Hillary's agenda or even her political potential are conservative pundits and their devotees.  She hardly comes up during our zombie get togethers, and when she does, it's negative as often as not.  Indeed, do you remember her tepid reception at the Coretta Scott King funeral, even with Bill by her side? There you go.  And do you also remember what happened to Lieberman in Connecticut? That's Hillary's future.  We don't like opportunistic, sleazy career politicians any more than you do.  
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 Mr Davidar thought he was writing the great Indian novel. Unfortunately, what came out at the end was a schoolboy effort, characterized by Raj cliches, prose that sounds like it is translated, and occasional paragraphs containing personal views on India and Indians which dont mesh with the main text at all. I am glad I borrowed this free of cost from the library and did not waste my money - though I did waste my time reading it. All I can say is that it would make good reading on a long flight - at least the story has tempo and keeps you mildly entertained 
 I agree with the last reviewer who said this is a "sleeper" but for very different reasons. I had to force myself to read through this, hoping that something unique would emerge, but it never happened. Everything in it is dated, but it doesn't have the charm of say Darvas's books. There's no "bad" advice here, but little good advice after determine the trend, wait for a reaction, buy or sell and hold on. Worst of all, the book literally fell apart in my hands with pages coming out of the binding (and this was a new copy) so I can't even sell this dog. 
 My review may be unfair since I quit reading at page 70 when I admitted to myself that I was bored out of my mind and couldn't find any enthusiasm to go further. If anything interesting happens after page 70, it's too late anyway 
 There wasn't enough input from primary sources in this book - interviews with, and direct quotes from, family and friends - to make it antyhing resembling a definitive biography.  The details that were provided came off sounding more like heresay than fact, and there was more pop psychology in this than seemed appropriate.  The author came across as extremely knowledgeable about Grant's movies, but then got some key details wrong (as noted in detail by other reviewers) but the rest of it seemed like it was written from the outside looking in, which undermined the credibility of the book.  The photo on the front was the best part 
 I bought this book as a text book for a college course. I was extremely dissappointed because the style in which Mr. Edwards writes is an excellent example of what a text book should not be.  I wondered if I had bought the clif note version. I felt this book was written like a cookbook.  It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I wanted to throw the recipe away.  I felt that Mr. Edwards book was an excellent example of "easy way out" management.  He limited the examples in the text to only the those he used, and left an impression that all of his decisions were correct. I would like to ask Mr. Edwards if he felt he was successful in running the PG County Fire Dept. using the discussed methods.  I would also ask if he felt the Dept. was in better shape after his tenure as Chief. If you are interested in learning to manage fire service personnel you may want to read this book, because of the limited information on the topic.  But if you set it down after the first ten pages dont be suprised, I have seen toast that wasnt as dry as this book 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the "strongest/purest" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 "perfect" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.  Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with "the deathbed edition" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.   I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.   To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The "true" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers.. 
 I am taking Calc II and am using this book. This book is horrible! I missed a lecture and when I tried doing the homework I got stuck. There are no example like the examples. I am here on this site to buy companion book so that I can do better on my homework. I wish they would stop using this book at university level courses. 
 I was dissapointed by all of the hype and rave reviews this book was given.  The author has good subject matter but has chosen a most difficult and almost incoherent writing style in which to convey her thoughts.  The novel jumps from place to place faster than rabbit being chased by a fox.  Chapters consist of bits of images pasted together like a collage rather than in a coherent, logical order.  The novel reads like a MTV rap video.  Perhaps some consider this innovation.  I consider it bad prose.    The prose is choppy, awkward and at times obscured by so much symbolism as to be obscure and unintelligable.  Many sentences fail to follow logically what was written previously.  CHapters are broken down into one or two sentence subchapters that seem loose and unconnected.    All this makes for painful reading that in the end seems not worth the effort.  The reviewers seem to be attracted to the unique style, glitz that may impress some but ultimately loses its shine 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 this book is ok, but it's a weak ripoff of The Great Big Burger Book, which is also 100 recipes, all kinds of meat and fish, etc but the first one is a much better book, easier to reproduce. 
 I recently bought this "Swing Time" CD as part of an eBay shopping spree. (I know, "fool me once," etc.) I saw that the disc had rave reviews here, and so I was willing to take a chance. Plus there were numbers on it that greatly appealed to me. ("Miss Annabelle Lee" by Mike Speciale was the clincher.) Well, I'm afraid the disc has that "Hebden touch"--that tell-tale sound of digital hedge trimmers above the music. Being more confident and resourceful now in the thick of middle age, I immediately ripped the disc to my hard drive and equalized it in Wavepad (though I imagine Audacity would work well also), cutting all frequencies above 4600 hz. I have to say that except for the one or two that were processed beyond recall (with that lovely underwater digital sound), I managed to create a quite listenable disc. No more loud, screeching, piercing digital noise.  Mr. Hebden always finds such delightful, rare records--and vandalizes them.  Good stuff here, hence two stars rather than one.  Still, I can't recommend this CD unless you are willing to re-equalize out the higher frequencies and you particularly wish to hear some of the selections.  
 A slow-moving, pretentious novel.  The main character is arrogant and unbearable.  Throughout the entire book, my feeling was who cares?  And, to the author, just tell me your message.  It could have been said in one sentence.  I don't need a boring story to get your point. 
 The Criterion Collection, a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films, is dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning, original supplements.The foundation of the collection is the work of such(real) MASTERS of cinema as Renoir, Godard, Kurosawa, Cocteau, Fellini, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Hitchcock, Fuller, Lean, Kubrick, Lang, Sturges, Dreyer, Eisenstein, Ozu, Sirk, Bunuel, Powell and Pressburger.  The Criterion Collection must feel embarrassed for wasting  a tremendous amount of time in this glorious package to glorify the most incompetent of all filmmakers. I did not watch any of the extras, but I hope you can find there those hilarious TV- clips from the 70s with Welles crying like a baby...."Oh...They only let me do the movie I wanted to make in Kane.... 
 I thought the information was useful at times and other times i felt i needed a stronger back ground of schooling to understand the author. Overall good for understanding how the mind works but there are better books on exercises to help with my back pain. Buy a more up to date book. 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 This book is one big ploy to get unsuspecting readers to purchase website and newsletter subscriptions from Trudeau!   "Author" Kevin Trudeau was convicted for credit card fraud and spent 3 years in a federal penetenary.   Beware Consumers: He obtained the card numbers from one of his snake oil infomericals! 
 Like most GPX radios this offers much and doesn't deliver. Reception is very poor at best and the lack of batteries other than the built-in and non-removable rechargeables makes no sense at all, you can't just pop in a couple of alkalines and use it. You must wait for it to charge or turn the handle. Could pose a problem when the buit-in batts stop holding a charge.  I returned mine within hours of the purchase 
 This is cute- but, it's not as good as Brown Bear. The words don't just roll off your tongue like Brown Bear. I don't find it as "catchy". 
 I bought my first CRC book (Handbook of Math Tables) about 40 years ago.  I used it until it fell apart, then have bought a few more copies over the years, along with a few of the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics and the excellent Engineering Science book.  I've always had good regard for CRC's publications.  However, reading what happened between the author and CRC soured my attitude towards CRC.  While there's nothing wrong with making a profit, their behavior seems excessive.  Based on what I've read, I've decided to not purchase any more CRC products.  If you feel the same way, encourage your colleagues to do the same.  I'd like to feel that CRC won the battle, but lost the war.    Finally, I haven't used the web site's material a lot, but when I did, it was quite good.  I suggest going with another poster's suggestion of using the web, but not buy the book 
 After 50 pages, I just skipped to the end, more in the hope the cat was unharmed than any of the characters. The plot was totally unbelievable, the writing was unprofessional, and the story was a joke. Newspaper articles about a serial maniac, who has already maimed 10 women appearing on page 3?? A DA who could care less? A doctor who foolishly allows a strange man access to her home, without any clue whatsoever that he might be stalking her? I could go on and on----bottom line: don't bother with this book. 2-9-02 
 The author jumped around too much in his narrative.  It was hard to follow and the characters were not developed very well  I was disappointed. 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 After a friend highly recommended the Dark Tower series to me, I trudged through The Gunslinger promising myself to keep my expectations low in accordance with the author's plea to look beyond the first book.  Unfortunately, I found The Drawing of the Three to be one of the weakest stories I've ever read.  I think the best description has already been stated elsewhere in these reviews...dull.    I guess this must be one of those series that you either love or hate.  For those who enjoy a good fantasy series of the likes of Goodkind, Jordan, Brooks, Feist, Donaldson, and Herbert, I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere.  Unlike Roland, the span of time that I wasted reading this book means a lot to me.  
 This cd was garbage the only song i liked was street lights and that;s just because the chorus was ok. i bought this cd because the source gave it 4 out of 5 mics. it was just garbage. after i bought it i gave it to my brother and he did not like it eithe 
 The wieght is accurate, but the body fat is way off. I had my body fat done 6 months ago by a doctor and I was 12% six months later I wiegh 5 lbs less and the scales says I'm 25%. something is off and I trust the doctor. If all you want is to see your wieght its fine, but the rest... well find another scale 
 This book is about a Jewish girl named Hannah Green who flees from Spain in fear of the Spanish Inquisition after witnessing her mother being captured and burned alive at the stakes for being a Jew.  She comes to England with her father and lives as a Christian while following the Jewish religion in secrecy.  Through a chain of events she becomes a royal fool and a spy - for both Queen Mary and Elizabeth.   Throughout the book Hannah talks about how she misses her mother and can still smell her mother's burning flesh from the stakes and then also professes her love for Queen Mary and what a wonderful woman she is.  It is well documented in history as well as this book about Queen Mary's burning of hundreds of non-Catholics at the stakes.  A practice that earned her the name - Bloody Mary.  The book is very sympathetic towards Queen Mary and portrays her as a virtuous woman who believed that she was burning people for their own sake - "only doing what she believed to be right in her heart".    The fact that Hannah was living her life in fear of being discovered as a Jew and continued to deeply love Queen Mary was extremely unbelievable and ridiculous. I could not help but roll my eyes every time I read how much Hannah loved and admired Queen Mary.  
 Many, many years ago I read Catherine Coulter, read her avidly, eagerly looking forward to her next book. Well, this is the first one of hers that I have read in about a decade and WHAT HAPPENED? Three times I set this book down in disgust, only to come back to it out of sheer stubbornness.  There is not enough room to write about just how bad this book was. From generally poor writing (Mary Lisa said, Jack said, Lou Lou said... until you want to yell "I KNOW who is involved in this conversation!), silly plot, unneccessary side stepping.   WHO CARES that the hero digs a chunky chip into guacamole? OH WOW, we get to know the different flavors of potato chips being devoured by three woman while they talk about the big case. WHEN have any of us heard of investigating cops asking "why is she wearing those pajamas when you are wearing those"? YEAH sure, an agent involved in a case is going to let endangered person call the shots in even the tiniest part of the investigation. And the names! Mary Lisa? Lou Lou? Puker? Gimme a freaking break! Aaaarrrrggggg!!!   Ms. Coulter, I used to love your books. PLEASE get back to what you used to do so well. If you cannot write the "FBI style" books that are so popular now, then don't. STOP feeding the bestseller beast anything less than your best. Cease. Desist. Please go back to what you are great at 
 I made the mistake of purchasing his older book called The A.R.T. of making babies updated edition. Do not buy unless your doing a research paper. This book was written in 1998 and the information is outdated. Make sure you purchase the 2005 edition. I wish amazon.com would have made this clearer. I did read it anyways and had the book  been filled with updated information it could be informative. I found the "Couple's guide to In Vitro Fertilization a much better book. Having recently gone through the procedure it was right on the money and very easy to read and understand 
 Like so many others in these reviews (I should have read them first!), I can categorically say that this is one of the worst software/hardware products I've ever bought.  It does not work, tech support is useless, and you should not even try to make it work. I am a computer expert with a great computer, and there is ABSOUTELY NOTHING I can do to make this work.  Don't buy.  
 I loved the early M*A*S*H episodes.  Equally intelligent, humane, cynical, sardonic, and just right out hilarious, they were some of the best television ever produced.  Unfortunately, the show moved away from this formula (which worked amazingly well) to the latter day formula.  The show became overly preachy, annoying, incredibly sanctimonious, politically correct, badly acted, badly written, pretentious, and downright silly at times.  The show ran for 11 seasons, and with all sitcoms that run too long, it quickly ran out of juice.  But that doesn't excuse the poor quality of the shows from 1975 onwards.  Hawkeye and BJ's characters became incredibly annoying, especially Hawkeye and his constant flirting with nurses.  It was funny early on, but as he aged, it became more and more childish.  Alda's acting is way over the top in these later seasons.  Since he was the one running the show for all intended purposes, I suppose no one told him to tone it down.  Charles is really the only intelligent and sympathetic character here, and the one I like the most.  You're not supposed to like him because of his "blue blood" upbringing, but you do anyway, because Hawkeye and BJ are so damn irritating.  You would think that BJ and Hawkeye wouldn't be so naive sometimes about things, considering they've been in a war now for years.  Soldiers are very jaded, cynical people, and with good reason.  They don't get more naive as time progresses.  The early episodes had Hawkeye much more jaded than in these later ones, and it should be the other way around.  Watch the first 3 seasons (except when Henry gets killed, which was just done for cheap shock value).  Those were the best... 
 The book, "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" is a gross misnomer.  At best, the book should be entitled "A Good Personal Finance Guide".  If a person bought the book, as I did, for expert stock market investment guidance, he/she may likely be highly disappointed.  The book contains very good personal finance guidance, that's all.  Way overstated with the title! 
 This unit replaced my old AIO 7410, which I LOVED. This one just feels cheap. The construction is cheap, parts are loose, and it feels like a child's toy, not an office tool. Given the choice, I would not buy another one 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 Being a lab owner, I bought this book as a gift for another lab owner, and was quite disappointed when I received it.  It's still a cute book, but I  didn't find it to be nearly as funny as I thought it would be 
 Here's the deal scoop on this.  Lots of repeated questions, at least one blatantly wrong answer, and some ambiguous questions that will make you feel stupid for not getting it when in fact it's just a stupid question.  A lot of times the author gets lazy and will provide the following explanation as to why the answer is correct: "statement of fact".  Gee that doesn't help too much.  I guess you can get this book if you like tough love, meaning, it MAY teach you by abusing you.    Not a book for you if you don't already know the material.  Only get it if you need sample questions.  
 The stories that are part of the historical events and those directly coming from either personal experience or from the Guru themselves are great.  The attempt to wander into academic commentary is so incompetent and misguided as to be and insult to those who have waded into the inner waters.  It is pomp and speculation combined with bad grammer.  If you were confused and wishing clarification this is not the place.  This book does not carry the blessing of the living teacher herself, nor is there and acknowledgment of her in the beginning. Look elsewere 
 Dr. Arthur Guyton and Dr. John Hall fail in offering a comprehensive molecular understanding of physiology.  Although the general presentation of subjects is decent, it does not offer a thorough understanding of molecular events that occur to create what is observed macroscopically.  The diagrams are weak utilizing ancient graphs that do not serve to clarify difficult points, and the book is in desparate need of some schematics and flow charts.  Tip to Guyton and Hall:  today's medical students need more than just a cursory glance at the molecular basis of physiology.  And I would suggest to those reading to check out Berne and Levy and Ganong, the latter of which offers up much more detail than Guyton despite being a review text 
 This movie was a big dissapointment. Lame acting, lame script and 70's chicks with bad acting skills. Not a very good "Women In Prison" film....there are better one like "Reform School Girls"....the band Caged Heat is way better than the movie...pass it up and get a life 
 The specs look great, and the features it has work great. Sound quality is amazing. But many parts of the device are cheaply made, such as the main navigaion/controll device, and the headphone jack, both things needed for operation of the player. Also if you're buying this for OGG or FLAC playback be warned it doesn't play many of these properly. Within two weeks the screen broke, I tried to get it repaired with Cowon but they where of no help, so I returned it to Amazon 
 Argh - hoping to find a good survey of the geologic processes behind the Earth we know today but written for a non-geologist, I found his writing unfocused, tortured and pedantic -especially for someone who claimed to be targeting the geological neophyte.  Just ghastly and dry.  I suspect Mr Fortey's editor was handing out bonuses for using words that only 1 in 3 Phds had any chance of recognizing.  Mr Fortey must have picked up enough money on this incentive for a nice gourmet dinner.  This is an easy book to set aside. Just pick up a college geology text book and you will be better off 
 Child abuse is a sensitive subject.  To read a story about an abused child is hard enough, but to find out the author is a fraud causes the story to be mockery of itself.  What bothers me most about this story isn't the fact that the author is a phony, it's the lack of humanity within the pages.  Every character the narrator meets in this book is an abuser, addict, psycho or pederast.  The situations in the book are absurd and implausible.  j.t. leroy (?) wallows in self-pity and self-righteousness. I've read many disturbing books based on real-life stories of torrid childhood, and I started reading this book with an open mind, but I became disgusted with this so-called novel, and I'm not a sensitive reader. I hated this book 
 I also have to echo the comments of other reviewers when saying if you have inexpensive, common cutlery this sharpener will work OK.  If you have Chef's Quality cutlery don't bring it near this machine.  It leaves a rough edge no matter which stone you use and simply isn't meant for good quality knives.  If you paid a couple of hundred dollars or more for your set of kitchen knives, get them professionally sharpened.  If you have run-of-the-mill cutlery this machine will do OK 
 I found the characters dull. The writing effusive and the story boring. I should have put it down when it started examining the death scene from the dung beetle's perspective 
 If this book is fictional as even the people who are crazy about it admit, then how could they take it as historic fact? The degree of emotionalism involved by the Armenian reviewers here is phenomenal. It's almost as though this supposed genocide is a religious experience, and the truth needs to be damned.    An Ara Belian (Feb. 4, 2004) is upset at the revelations of another reviewer, whose essay made a lot of sense to me. He counts on stories by relatives as his evidence... but nobody is arguing Armenians did not suffer. The point is, everyone suffered during those tragic times. Didn't Armenians kill Turks in large numbers, that we never hear about? (Why are there no Turks in Armenia, when once the Turks were the majority?)    The point is whether a governmental extermination policy was in effect; this is the unproven part of genocide theory, and emotionalism is an unfair substitute for history.  All the "documented evidence, witnesses and memoirs of the genocide" prove is that ugliness occurred during what was a state of war. That's why none of it was admissible as actual evidence when the British attempted to try the Turks for massacre crimes at the end of WWI.    Taking the moral high road by claiming numbers don't matter is awfully ingenuous of Belian when propagandists make sure to tell us numbers do matter... the higher the number, the greater the sympathy value. That's why false numbers as 1.5 million have been created. Instead of saying he was made to "fume and filled ...with anger," why doesn't Mr. Belian THINK? Approach this subject coolly, rationally and without emotion? Instead of acting like a religious zealot who doesn't care about reason and common sense?  
 I picked up this book after seeing some good reviews about it. The whole book is about "Strategic Reflection Point". I was disappointed that Andy Grove didn't try to explain SRP in a more concrete manner. After finishing the book, I still have very vague & abstract knowledge on SRP. Nevertheless, Andy Grove is still one of the best CEOs I admired 
 What a load of turnspeak.  G. Orwell (deceased 
 It's a decent book, but the reproductions don't do justice to the art.  If you're looking to save a buck or two and pick up a collection of the art of this growing movement, this is the book for you. But I recommend the book "Pop Surealism" if you want a truely beautiful coffeetable art book. 
 Amartya Sen is a serious economist, who has some serious ideas, but they are not in this book.  The book purports to be an philosophical/economic argument for "freedom now" as both the means and the goal of economic and social policy, and an argument against the postponement of "freedom" until after "purely" economic development has occurred.    Freedom, Sen claims -and not merely wealth or the rule of law- is the best vehicle to promote...well...freedom itself.  If this reasoning sounds circular to you, you are not alone.  On one interpretation, this strikes me as trivially true.  Sure: promote freedom and you will indeed get freedom.  If, on the other hand, Sen is stating that freedom is "the solution" to global poverty, his thesis is dubious at best.  And this is especially so because Sen's book is NOT really a polemic against Confucian statism (i.e. the "Lee thesis"), it is a polemic against economic liberalism.  Lee is just a straw man used to advance Sen's more fundamental claim: that freedom -properly understood- is actually what he refers to as "capability."  In other words: freedom is not merely the absence of external constraints, but the capability to accomplish things in the world.  This is NOT "Development as Freedom" but rather "Freedom as Capability."  And this is where Sen really loses me.  Even IF "capability" is a quantifiable, measureable, controllable, predictable variable that can be maximized (extremely dubious, since the list of possible verbs of which one can be capable is practically infinite), this argument is nothing even remotely new.  Sen's allegedly groundbreaking discovery is simply the modern incarnation of Isaiah Berlin's "positive freedom," FDR's "freedom from want," and the other muddled reinventions of the concept of "freedom" which together date back to the early Counter-Enlightenment.    These ideas sound like doublethink because they are doublethink.  Public health care and make-work jobs simply do not leap to mind when one thinks of "freedom" - if they did, there would be no need for this book.  The conceptual epitome of "freedom" is one's release from prison.  That's not the necessarily the "capability" to do anything.  If we want to discuss welfare economics, on the other hand, that's fine -- but let's not confuse our students by misappropriating the language of liberty.  But I am not deterred from this work merely by the fact that I disagree with Sen's thesis.  In the end, I am turned off by the massive acclaim this book has recieved, despite its glaring intellectual mushiness.  Sen has supplanted Marx as the English professor's favorite economist, distracting attention from those thinkers whose ideas might actually make a modest difference in combating global poverty 
 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 This book was not my cup of tea - to much law and stuff. I would love to have seen more advice regarding the adult biz but turns out this book is more of a history book and 2257 regulation book. But for people working in a law firm dealing with the adult industry I guess this book is perfect 
 I'm sorry for Loga Ramin Torkian and Narada Productions, but this album is something everyone should AVOID TO BUY! I'm used to Ghazal's Persian and Indian Improvisations and as I rate 5 stars Kayhan Kalhor and Shujaat Husain Khan's works, I HAVE TO rate only 1 star (yet that's too much!!) this miserable, poor album: each track has no structure, no beginning, no close, no range. This 2002 year album has nothing to do with 2000 year Axiom of Choice's "Niyayesh" album, a wonderful piece of work, gorgeous and magnificent! I would never suggest "Unfolding" to a friend! (neither to an enemy!). I'd buy "Niyayesh" instead 
 Although Speaker for the Dead is a decent story overall and does have some great sci-fi elements, like relativistic space travel, I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as Ender's Game. I thought of it like Return of the Jedi if the rebels spent the whole movie pondering the social behavior of the ewoks.  Of course we're not talking about Star Wars or movies here. Speaker for the Dead was just a peculiar departure from Ender's Game, which is one of the best novels I've ever read. I almost felt like Card decided he didn't really feel like writing another sci-fi novel, so he went with a biologist drama instead 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the "Just say no" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack 
 Anyone hoping to gain an objective insight into the complex tragedy of the GLF should avoid this book at all costs.  Despite the author's reputation as a noted scholar in the field, he makes sweeping, generalized claims that  are simply not documented.  In discussing the negative aspects of the GLF,  for example, all efforts are made to present Mao as not  responsible--somehow separated from the policy-making process and therefore  not responsible for the terrible consequences.  The millions of deaths that  resulted are acknowledged, but the author quickly points out that Mao did  inspire millions of workers in China to work for the common good, as if  this somehow compensated for the maniacal toll on the country.  I don't  know why Mr. Macfarquhar is such an apologist for Mao, but it clearly  interferes with the balance of his analysis and would outrage any sensible  student of Chinese history 
 This book needed a good editor who knew the different between an active and passive voice. The writing is much too flowery for my taste. I spend too much time thinking "huh?" and rereading passages. I didn't  finish it. Let me, instead, recommend Wolfgang Schivelbusch's A Taste of  Paradise 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 This book does have a fairly intricate plot, and I did want to know what would happen to Ned and Verity...that said, do people really enjoy being clubbed over the head with a hundred redundant clues?  One of the pleasures offered by fiction is puzzling out the situation--once you've figured out a particular aspect, it just becomes tedious to be given nudge after nudge, while the dimwitted protagonist stumbles around for another 100 pages.  Willis occasionally hits the mark with her humor, but her tricks get old after a few repetitions, leading up to a climax of self-congratulatory literary allusions and treacly religious overtones.  What a disappointment 
 My mother bought this for me for Christmas. She used the "available new and used" section to get it a little cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45. As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the Hans Wehr edition 
 Audition apparently seems to be some kind of unwanted stepchild of Adobe, based on the scarcity of resources Adobe seems to have dedicated to it. I bought this book based on other positive experiences with the "Visual Quickstart Guide" series, but as another reviewer states, this book barely covers what should essentially be in a basic user's manual. There is little if any detail, very few case-study example, and some significant holes in the instructions.   Example: in the "Using Cues" section - there is a section "to list and edit your cues," to "move cues" and to "delete cues"...but it says nothing about creating a cue to start with. These types of omissions can drive beginners insane, and signals some pretty bad editing.  Further, abstract explanations of sounds (or worse, how sounds work) are nearly useless. This book badly needs an accompanying cd. Five seconds of actual audio can teach more that fifty pages of words. Avoid this book 
 ignorance and propaganda run amok...a good movie for a lot of american dumb guys who like war movies just because they're war movies...the nazi's made films like this in the 1930's with the poles portrayed just like the vietnamese are in this film...the vietnamese boy in this movie is named ham chunk???  are you kidding me???  the sad part is no...they're not kidding...which makes this movie all the more revolting...but i see it's quite popular...which is informative as to how george w. bush got into the white house and why american soldiers are now bogged down in iraq...the same war mongering fat heads who didn't "get it" (understand the consequences of putting your big american nose in other people's business) then, don't get it now.  Winston Churchill warned, "those who do not remember their past are damned to repeat it"...a fine vintage vietnam war movie for simple minded viewers...remember freedom is not free...freedom to make millions of dollars from selling weapons and war materials to the government costs citizens billions of dollars...this movie stinks...unless your sophisticated taste enjoys war as entertainment.. 
 Day is superior to both Night and Dawn, the first two books in Elie Wiesel's Night trilogy. However, six aspects of Day really bug me:  First, Day's plot lacks cohesion and is out of chronological order, unlike Night and Dawn. The heart of a novel should either consist of either solid storytelling and an advancing plot or delicately crafted interwoven stories. In Day, it is instead largely a jumble of disparate memories - typically of women in steamy situations. This is not conducive to seamless communication.  Second, Wiesel originally wrote The Accident separately from Dawn and Night. As such, it is the least connected to the other two books. He decided at some point to change the title to Day, tack it on to his first two books, and call the resulting mumbo-jumbo a "trilogy." This is sloppy, self-centered, and ultimately irritating because now students at my school are required to read all three volumes.  Third, my same old complaint about Wiesel's writing holds true in Day: too much crying! I find it absurd how many times people cry in the Night trilogy - readers of Night and Dawn (as many of you readers this review are) can attest to this. Rather than making his readers more sympathetic to the feelings of his characters, Wiesel conditions them to indifference with this blatant overuse of sadness.  Fourth, Wiesel's comparisons in Day are too often uncreative at best, stale at worst. Too often he compares one woman to another, typically his mother or grandmother. Comparing one woman to another does nothing. These comparisons would be acceptable once or twice, but, one's patience wears thin after reading paragraph after paragraph of them. Wiesel should keep in mind that he is writing to other people who did not grow up with these women. Much more interesting and effective would be to compare the women to romantic inanimate objects such as the sun, the moon, or a budding rose.  Fifth, Wiesel shies away from many chances to show us a lurking literary prowess throughout Day. These opportunities crop up whenever somebody "talked for hours." It's hard to imagine that these terse, two-dimensional characters are really capable of speaking for hours without seeing the monologue on paper. Why does Wiesel hold these soliloquies back from us?  Sixth, and last, Wiesel doesn't vary his sentence structure enough, in Day or either of the other books in his Night trilogy. This is a run-of-the-mill high school error, and I'm surprised that neither he, nor Oprah, nor the legions of devoted oprah&wiesel fans pick up on this. His short, choppy sentences should be reserved those rare pulse-pounding moments, but Wiesel uses them everywhere.  I will quote from the text to illustrate my points:  Kathleen's face was twisted with pain. She looked like a sorceress who has lost her true face from having put on too many masks. A great fire burned around her. Suddenly she cried out and began to sob. My mother, I had never seen my mother cry. (p.74)  Kathleen. Tears were coming to her eyes. My mother didn't cry. At least not when other people were there. She only offered her tears to God. Kathleen looked a little like my mother; she had her high forehead, and her chin had the same pure lines. But Kathleen wasn't dead. And she was crying. (p.89)  These selections are the concluding paragraphs of two back-to-back chapters. And yet they say the same thing. That's not any kind of plot advancement that I've ever heard of. I hung my head upon reading the following, though I agree with it:  Nothing is more sacred than life, or healthier, or greater, or more noble. To refuse life is a sin; it's stupid and mad. You have to accept life, cherish it, love it, fight for it as if it were a treasure, a woman, a secret happiness. (p.67)  This "profound" realization flies in the face of what the narrator previously thought - that life wasn't worth fighting for. However, I knew that "life is all we have" before I even knew who Wiesel was. I know we humans must simultaneously struggle for our lives while still finding time to cherish them. I don't need an emotionally-estranged Holocaust-survivor narrator to take me by the hand and lead me through the way he discovered that truth, which is essentially the only task that Day accomplishes for society. Day certainly doesn't make one happier, unless one derives pleasure from knowing one can write better than a Nobel Peace Prize winner. I cannot speak for how this book affects other readers, however. Perhaps this book will save someone from suicide someday?  I will make you suffer though one more irresistible passage before I quit:  In the beginning she didn't cry. We were on the same level. We dealt with each other like equals. We were free. Each one free from himself and free from the other. When I didn't feel like keeping a date, I didn't. She did the same. And neither of us was angry or even hurt. When I didn't talk for a whole night, she didn't try to make me explain. The familiar question asked by lovers, "What are you thinking about?" didn't enter our conversations. Hardness had become our religion. Nothing was said that wasn't essential. We tried to convince each other that we could live, hope, and despair, alone. Each kiss could have been the last. At any moment the temple could have collapsed. The future didn't exist since it was useless. At night we made love silently, almost like our own witnesses. A stranger watching us in the street could easily have taken us for enemies. Rightly so, perhaps. True enemies aren't always the ones who hate each other. (p.90)  I prefer that my novels not read like Chicken Soup for the Soul.  Gyula arrives near the end of the book, providing the comic relief and fog-cutting outsider's insight that the rest of Wiesel's Night trilogy needed so desperately to keep from being the bore that it was. In Gyula's laughing light and portrait-mirror, the narrator sees himself for who he truly has become and discovers that he needs to change his outlook. Day was a more satisfying novel than either Night or Dawn in part due to this resolution and promised change in attitude.  I have concluded my reading of the Night trilogy, and of Wiesel, for good. I can't wait to discuss this trilogy in English class - fur will fly, for sure, as most readers of Wiesel whom I've met become insta-fans. I will conclude by saying this - if you enjoyed Night and Dawn, then Day will be right up your alley 
 I read others' reviews before I bought this book and I have to say that I am very surprised that no one mentions that it is only a 4x6 inch, slim, pocket book!  As you can imagine, it contains very little information.  It will take you about half an hour to read, maybe an hour if you read slowly.  If you are already a vegaterian, then you don't need to buy this - I promise you there is nothing that you don't already know in this book.  If you are not a vegetarian, then you are better off buying a more comprehensive book on the subject.. 
 Though advertised as a continuation (i.e. 14th Edition)of the "Filmgoers companion" it is only a list of people in the movies. Gone are Halliwell's definitions of movie tradecraft and lists of themes, individual classics and personal notes. A fine actor like Lee J. Cobb gets a single line, while Jayne Mansfield, known more for her off screen antics, gets many more. The quotes from the movie personalities is a nice touch, but when I look up somebodies filmography I do not want to see etc. at the end of an incomplete list 
 This book tends to jump off topic (most aren't explained well). For example, they talk about one thing but the exercises are a bit different than the chapter's topic. Most of the information isn't fully explained. If you are in a class where the instructor assigns the exercise questions for homework, you are screwed. You may not know what to do unless you seek outside help (study guide, tutor etc.) or read beyond the chapter

 I returned this book to Amazon, because there were no color pictures of any of the myriad hot peppers discussed therein.  There is no real way to identify a particular type of pepper with only a black and white drawing/photo.  As someone who taught school from elementary to university level, I can say that learners, especially me, would greatly benefit by viewing color photos of the various hot peppers discussed in this publication 
 I bought the book on the basis of the reviews and on a quick read of a copy a friend owned.  It looks really good on the surface and does have a lot of useful information.  One problem I found is that many of the example photos seem to be inserted only to increase the photo count.  Also, because of printing limitations, I find it very difficult to see the differences between before and after examples.  I have edited this review to fix an error.  However, I can not figure out how to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars.  Consider this a 4 star review.  
 This seems to be a very typical graduate level text at most universities, but I don't think it is organized very well nor is it very readable.  First of all, the book is translated from French which probably did not help the formating and prose much.  Second the notation used in the text seemed arcane and dated.  I remember spending hours just to figure out what some of the notation was trying to convey.  I think a thorough reading of Griffiths QM book would be much more advised than trying to read this book.  However, all that being said, perhaps the book might be useful as a refrence as it is rather encyclopedic.  In summation, find a better QM book to study from than this one 
 I purchased this model at a local store after reading mixed reviews. It was in my price range and had at least some good reviews so I thought I'd take a chance. WOW, bad idea! After about 25 sheets of paper fed 1 page at a time the feed mechanism stopped functioning. I was careful not to overload the unit or run it too long, but the thing didn't last 5 minutes!!!  Stay away 
 The only play Shakespeare wrote that I did not like at all was "Othello." "All's Well That Ends Well" was never that popular. It lacks the hilarious tone of "The Comedy of Errors,"  the superb construction of "Much Ado About Nothing," or the  profound messages of "The Merchant of Venice."  Also, we can very  well be in two minds of what to think of Bertram's rejection of Helena. The  characters are not that convincing, and much of the humour is based on bad  taste. But the play is not quite a flop. There are moments of suspense.  There is some delightful comedy (especially when Bertram chooses to stay in  battle rather than go home and marry Helena). And at times, Helena is  memorable. I would not make time to read this play, but then it's not a  waste of time either 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 Our bookgroup scheduled a speakerphone chat with Donna Woolfolk Cross, author of the "other" Pope Joan, and I bought this book by accident! I was so confused when everyone said how much they loved the book -- only to find out I had read the wrong one. I had so much trouble participating in the conversation because I had so much trouble slogging through this Royidis/Durrell version of the story.  The Royidis/Durrell version of Pope Joan is sl-o-o-o-w moving, old-fashioned (after all, it's more than 100 years old), and dull. In contrast, the Cross version is fast-paced, riveting and impossible to put down!  The notes at the end of the Cross book, documenting her research, are fascinating, and make it so clear that Joan was more than a fantasy.     If you insist on reading this version, read it for comparison purposes only, and enjoy a good snooze. If you want a great read, accompanied by actual historical reference, purchase the Cross version of Pope Joan 
 As a disciple of Freud, Zweig was fascinated with the new psychoanalysis and applying it to historical characters. I think he overdoes it in his biography of Marie Antoinette, attributing her love of clothes, gambling, and partying to supressed desires rather than youthful vivacity, since she was a teenager, married at fourteen. This is a book that has outlived its time. Unfortunately, Zweig's Freudian interpretation has been imitated by other biographers and gives a false view of Marie Antoinette even to this day 
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 This grater is fine when you can get it to work, but most often the handle doesn't screw in correctly and you can't get it to. It's mostly a waste of time, though the concept is a great one. I'd recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one 
 With so many good books out there just waiting to be explored, why would anyone read Norman Mailer?  This book is a testament to the author's own arrogance, and we the reader are forced to suffer through all its self-indulgent twists and turns.  Don't read books by this neanderthal.  He's way past his prime.  Actually, he never was in his prime.  All of his books are equally dreadful.  So let's put Mailer's books in the trash bin where they belong.  Haven't we had enough of these writers who write and publish by hubris alone?  Go away Mailer, your time us up 
 I want to make a short comment here: 1) This book is quite confusing. It mixed up the real story with the make up one. 2) Saying that Ramanujun thought Goldbach Conjecture is wrong was a huge mistake. Everyone believe that Goldbach Conjecture is true. And Ramanujun is a real genius. I cannot stand this make up part 
 anybody who is a true 2pac fan will understand that this album would leave 2pac rolling around in his grave. 2pac would never have worked with artists like eminem or elton john and what is even more sickening is the clear distortion of his voice to fit in with eminems beats. These are not songs that 2pac would have ever produced himself, does not even have a familiar 2pac feel or vibe. Anyone purchasing this album is only making eminem richer and defaming 2pac's legacy as far as I am concerned. People who disagree should listen to 2pac's original albums and then understand what i am talking about. This album is an embarassment to somebody as great as 2pac 
 After reading this, I didn't have the 'warm and fussy' feeling.  The ending is somewhat weak, and beware not to read the back of your book (depending on which print you have), mine had a spoiler on it.  I love Heinlein's book, but wish he had choosen another ending 
 The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes 
 I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense. Then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship.  But it gets kind of repetetive and boring, because they just go from one room to another.  It's like they get into one room, someone says "Here, this is the only way out."  Someone else says that maybe there's another way, but the other person says there isn't, then the water's coming, so they have to get out of that room quickly.  When they make their way into the next room, it's the same thing over and over again. When they finally get off of the ship, they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off.  Then a guy shoots a flare, helicopters come, and the movie's over. So basically, this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over.  This is one movie I know I won't be buying 
 The important top hand bar is missing. The thing smells like gear grease. I can't tell if I like to use is, because it's missing parts 
 Emo noisemaking and Christian themes. The two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship. Face it kids this is a fad. A really pathetic fad. Disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the Disco scene. The same happened with Hair Metal and Nu-Metal. Those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day. You will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity. As I always say in my reviews, this is trash and should be treated so accordingly. This band should take their Emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity. 
 Kurt's journals were a private thing, not something that should have been mass marketted by corporate America to kids...All that they did was exploit Kurts deepest thoughts to make a quick buck off of angst filled youth...The company who published this book can rot. And the people who buy it, I question. No matter how curious you are these were the inner thoughts of an artist that should have never seen the light of day 
 While it's possible it's helpful to someone somewhere to know 700 pages worth of performance measuring information, beginning at details, and ending at details, what's really needed is a simple flowchart.  If this book somewhere had just a small table saying something about acceptable measured values, and in turn what could be done to change each one, then we'd be getting somewhere.  As it is, the book's a mess.  The book gives a "starter set" of metrics, but it's on page 110, is six pages long, encompassing probably 100 measurements, and fails to note how the expected results / measurements would be at all connected to controllable factors.  From our perspective, speed was the desired result.  It appears using the authors' standpoint and methodology that to buy a new computer would be far more economical than to run all 1200 tests that are poorly explained in this book.  
 Buyers beware of the hardback version of E. P Thompson's classic work "The Making of the English Working Class". Firstly, note that the hardback is a 1966 edition. This means that is does not have Thompson's 1968 postscript, nor his 1980 preface (it probably also misses the author's 1968 revisions, but I have not checked this). Secondly, this is not an organically produced hardback: the picture on the cover is glued on, and the spine does not have the author's name (instead, it has the name "Peter Smith" - so who the hell is Peter Smith?). All in all, a shocker for purists, or any serious scholar, made all the worse for the magnificence of the original 
 I had read a book about the French and Indian war, one about the revolution and also the recent best seller,1776.  I found The War That Forged a Nation an excellant addition to my understanding of this important period in American history.  I would highly recommend it.  Very readable 
 The shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly.  Be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small.  Also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive 
 Don't really care too much for the soundtrack because the songs I was looking for was not on the soundtrack.  To RR "Lovely" the name of the song that played while Kenya & Marcus was having dinner I believe is "Change It All" by Goapele.  A song with very liberating lyrics.  I've been looking for this song since the DVD came out.  I heard it over a friends house this weekend.  
 JJ, the name of the song you are looking for is "Like You Like An Arsonist" by Paris Texas 
 I think a lot of us are on the same page here.  I think the spotlight review is dead on accurate.  I'm like the reviewer below me, I bought this album only because RJD2 was doing the beats.  I've never been that big a Blueprint fan.  Maybe I'm missing the point or I'm just not getting what the allure of Blueprints rhymes are.  I'd love for someone to point out to me what makes him so good -- I'm not hearing it.  The thing about it, though, is that RJ didn't really come with any heat either.  The production is lukewarm at best.  I've been a fan of RJ's for a minute now, but I found myself nodding off to a lot of the production.  And I think it was already pointed out that "No Gimmicks" is a bit misleading because this album is littered with gimmicky cuts.  Tracks like "Keep It Hot For Daddy", "I Need My Minutes" and "Blame It On The Yager" are straight up wack.  Like I stated before, I've never been that big of a Blueprint fan, but he does manage to come through every now and then.  "Hand-Me-Downs" is one of the few tracks that have the combination of beats and rhymes.  "Keys" is a great story rap with decent production, but I can't help but feel like this song would've been astounding if left in the hands of a more capable emcee.  "Priceless" is a good example of what these two can do when they both come correct.  "The Cool Thing To Do" is another good cut too.  Things Go Better With RJ & Al is worth picking up only if you're an RJD2 fan.  Even then, the production isn't necessarily stellar.  I still don't see what all the buzz is about concerning Blueprint either.  Dude is one of the most basic rappers I've ever heard.  I don't expect Chino XL or Canibus type wordplay, but hell, I can get in the booth and do what Blueprint does -- just talk into the mic.  There are a few nuggets here and there, but not enough to warrant buying the album.  Download this one and skip on paying for it.  Standout Tracks: Priceless (My Favorite), Hand-Me-Downs, Keys, and The Cool Thing To D 
 The advice given in this book is really so banal that I suppose anyone could have written the book. I really don't understand why there has been so much attention given to the concept of emotional intelligence.  Seems to me that normal folks are, according to the description of the authors, emotionally intelligent.  No need to write books about something that's so  obvious. Is it maybe written for those you lack the real intelligence 
 I was greatly disappointed with this book. Not only was the ending of the novel predictable, but the characters were down right dull. I really wished that the dream sequences had included a few from the actual movies. Now I realize the backlash this can cause, and I know the books aren't written just for the fans of the movies, but without giving too much of the plot away, it would've been nice to see some dreams from the movie characters. There have been only two books from Black Flame in this series I have enjoyed "Suffer the Children" and "Perchance to Dream" (which I only enjoyed partly because charcters were offed that shouldn't have been), and it was because the authors understood the charcter and story material and wrote really good novels. I can't understand how these mediocre novels keep reaching the shelves. Hopefully if there is another book it will be better 
 Una interpretacin absolutamente falaz tanto de la historia como de la filosofa poltica. Un sinsentido que lamentablemente ha tenido enorme repercusin en la formulacin de polticas desde el imperio hacia la "periferia". Un deseo de teleologa desde la imposicin del poder. En fin, hay que leerlo slo para rerse un rato con tanto absurdo. 
 i doubt that i could persuade any die hard grateful dead folks from shying away from this. the grateful dead were fine in their day, but don't tread on deep waters of the NC/TN/KY/VA/WV bluegrass. excellent movement of the fingers on this CD and if yer into fast fingers, well fine. but like fast movement of the fingers does not make the blues; fast movement of the fingers does not make bluegrass.  it comes with the territority. a valiant effort. but stick with the potheads who don't know music from whatever 
 This movie is for liberals what the Left Behind book series is for Christian conservatives, it portrays reality how they want to see it. Its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much PC political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it. Entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall IMO 
 i have read 5 graham greene books and this is by far the lamest of them. this was conceived of first as a hollywood movie, and it shows. the book is not much more that a silly, corny thriller (just what hollywood orders over and over and over). there is very little character development involved, & the the sense of place (vienna after world war ii) could have been given much greater depth, as well. this is simply a plot being rushed onto the big screen ( a half-baked, lame plot, at that) to make some cash. pass this one by. 
 this book seems to target children under 12 years of age.  It has very few pointers for adolescents. this book tends to be aimed at the education profession rather than parents 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 Yo, don't take this the wrong way because I'm not a hater but rather a big biggie fan. But this album is terrible. Its nothing but easy money for greedy producers by using old Biggie verses and whipping up new beats. Biggie certainly didn't leave very much unreleased material unlike Tupac then again I suppose he wasn't expecting he was going to die. But they still shouldn't do s*** like this. If you want to support Biggie's legacy this year which isn't a bad idea, pick up one of the classics - Ready 2 Die or Life After Death. 
 The problem with Mother Teresa's critics is that they attempt to hold her up as some sort of glorified social worker or political leader.  She was a religious.  She wasn't out to solve poverty, but to council and comfort... indeed, love the poorest of the poor, and to teach others to do the same.  Critics who claim the sisters are "sheep" who "blindly follow" their leader again do not understand religious life.  There is an oath of obedience, and you follow instruction, happily and without question.  If you want to be an independant helping poor people, then become a social worker.  These are different callings and different lives 
 I am a high-tech marketing manager and an adjunct professor. From both the real-world business side as well as the academic side, I found this book to have little value. It spends page after page on general issues regarding Internet Marketing, and never gets to anything that could be used or implemented in the business world. Topics are explained without giving specific details as to how to implement the Internet Marketing idea. A very specific example is a description of viral marketing which the author refers to as "Creating a Wave." The short section goes on to say that free media, publicity and word of mouth are important. Of course they are. But how do you get them? I feel sorry for the students that are required to purchase this book. I guess they'll have to learn Internet Marketing on the job. I'm glad I only paid $10 for this book used instead of the $90+ list price 
 We couldn't find ANY of the collectibles on which we needed information - and the index was the WORST I've ever seen!  I felt totally ripped off with this book but it would cost more to return than it was worth.  Maybe I can find an antique outhouse and supply it with a fresh 2007 price guide... 
 Having used Turbo Tax since 1990 I feel that I am qualified to comment on it. I have also used Quicken, Quicken Deluxe, Quicken Home & Business, QuickBooks Pro 2003 & QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition. The Turbo Tax product seems to get more user UN-FRIENDLY each year.  The navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's.  Like I said I WAS using QuickBooks Pro 2003 until tax time last year.  I purchased Turbo Tax Home & Business like I had for the past 4 years, and really got a shock when I found out that it would not import my data from QuickBooks Pro 2003.  Three year old software that was not compatible with Turbo Tax in 2006(actually 2005 tax year).  I ended up purchasing QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition 2006  ($280+) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done.  Intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed.  I am done with them and will purchase TaxCut this year 
 This book stretches reality to the point of absurdity.  I won't give anything away, but something happens at the end of this book that I find completely improbable.  Also, I don't particulary enjoy romance novel type sex scenes, of which there are a number in this book.  I'm very suprised at the high customer rating of this riduculous book 
 There were aspects of the book that I enjoyed- the writer has a great knowledge of the food and restaurant industry. Some of his tales were interesting-  The reading was really bogged down for me by the writer's almost "groupie" sense of being impressed that he can hang with great chefs. It seemed almost jouvenile to me-  He definitely takes the side of the industry and looks at customers with a good amount of disdain. To me it was hard to get through the book because the guy kept referring to his own relationships with people in the industry-  Also, he thinks that critics should not be anonymous- that to me is ridiculous in its own- how can you write an honest review of a establishment, if you were out eating salami sandwiches with the chef earlier that afternoon-  In my opinion the writer really gets off on rubbing elbows with restaurant elite-  Because he kept getting bogged down with being impressedm with himself, getting reservations at tough restaurants, etc., a lot of the material was hard to get through.  He also seems jealous of real writers and has to take a lot of shots at them-  Next time I see his name on a book cover- I'll skip it 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 After watching the movie "The Wedding Date", which is based upon this book, I felt like I'd missed something. It was a cute idea with amusing possibilities, but the movie was poorly executed. I figured I might as well give the book a shot. Usually books are better than movies, right?  Over all, I preferred the movie. Aside from a few moments of laugh-out-loud humor, most of it is pretty dry and bland. It drags on and on, with a good 100 pages to even get to the wedding. After the wedding, the book just kind of meanders, as if the author realized she couldn't possibly make it convincing that these two are so infatuated with each other after one afternoon. She could have meandered to 1000 pages, and I still wouldn't be convinced.  The book's biggest problem is the "heroine", Sophy. She is--as she often says herself--such a cow. Oh, and she's also fat. She's a raging b*tch towards Josh, who is technically doing her a rather nice favor, wouldn't you say? But she's constantly snippy with him, completely paranoid, and always assuming he thinks the worst about her. Plus, she lies on a consistent basis, especially to him. Yet he still likes her, despite all this...and despite the fact that she's fat. Any skinny, pretty woman is automatically a b*tch and a man-stealing cow. Maybe this is due to Sophy's fat-o-vision? Because of course, unlike those skinny pretty women, Sophy is too fat for a man to find her attractive. She's dead certain that as soon as someone a pound or two lighter walks onto the scene, Josh will be on them like white on rice. Isn't that lovely? But in spite of that, too, he still likes her. And despite the fact that she's fat.  Are you sick of me stating that Sophy is fat? Is it getting on your nerves? Because if it is, then this book will make you want to tear your hair out. I've been overweight for the greater half of my life, and I have self-esteem issues, but unlike Sophy, my every thought does not center around my weight. Of course, I, at least, would be justified. How the hell does Sophy, with her 36C chest, qualify as fat? Seeing as how she's about 5'10", a 36 inch underbust is not even close to fat.  Here's a little tip to the chick lit authors of the world: it's okay to make your herione overweight so long as you don't HARP ON ABOUT IT LIKE AN OBSESSIVE FREAK!   Completely unsympathetic as a character, it's impossible to feel bad for anything Sophy goes through, as she tends to reap what she sows. And the utterly predictible ending was completely unbelievable. Lovely idea, completely wasted on a Heroine From Hell and a "plot" held together by bubblegum and elastic bands. 
 Not bad... but not as nice as I wanted... But I got a refund so no worry 
 I expected something akin to Mortimer Adler's How to Read and Why.  Instead I found myself dragged into a solipsistic rant of Mr. Bloom's favorite books.  To be sure, some may enjoy his discussion of how Cervantes is instrumental to modern literature however this book did not meet my expectations.  Instead I got the impression that this is more of a 'vanity' book than anything.  Not only is the book mislabeled, it is an irritating read 
 While the mitt is beautiful and the price is right, it is narrow.  Most mitts flare towards the opening, this one does not.  I have larger forearms and it won't fit all the way up.  My husband has average sized arms and it won't go around his upper forearm either.  Since they are so long they go almost to your elbow 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 Science is about making deductions from factual evidence. It has no means of explaining anything that is supernatural.   However, religion requires the belief in supernatural forces and at least one supernatural being.   That DOES NOT mean religion is wrong, it just means it is a different subject matter than science and therefore DOES NOT belong in a science classroom.   You wouldn't expect English literature, music, history and other such subjects to be taught in a science classroom. Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God. I don't need - or want - my religious beliefs to force science to be conducted in a certain way. Quite frankly, anyone who feel that the honest teaching of science is a threat to their religious beliefs is someone who has great doubts about their religious beliefs! 
 In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.  While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.  According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).  The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.    One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God."  He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.  In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.   According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.  Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.  In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.    While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations. 
 The "author" wrote a sloppy piece of garbage that isn't well written.  Filled with rumors, inaccuracies and conspiracy theories by a right wing wacko.  This "book" deserves negative stars.  The "author" is known for being on the Howard Stern Show and walking the streets of Hollywood acting mentally ill 
 I HAVE BEEN SOMERSIZING FOR ABOUT 5 WEEKS AND HAVE ENJOYED THE FOOD RECIPES IN SUZANNE SOMERS 3 BOOKS, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS DESSERT BOOK.  SO FAR I HAVE LOST 10 LBS AND AM LOVING THE RESULTS WITHOUT STARVING MYSELF.  HER PROGRAM IS TRUELY A WAY TO LIVE BY.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PURCHASE HER PRODUCTS, BECAUSE SHE GIVES YOU MOST OF THE RECIPES IN HER BOOKS, I LIKE THAT!  THIS DESSERT BOOK DID FALL SHORT THOUGH COMPARED TO THE OTHER WONDERFUL BOOKS.  I HAVE TRIED THE CHEESECAKE WHICH IS OK, BUT WHEN YOUR EARLY ON HAVING THE SUGAR CRAVINGS IT LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED, I SUFFERD THROUGH.  WE ALSO TRIED THE ICE CREAM AND THE PREVIOUS REVIEW IS EXACTLY RIGHT, THE SOMERSWEET MAKES THE ICE CREAM HARD AS A ROCK, IT WASNT VERY GOOD.  I HAVE YET TO TRY ANY OTHER RECIPES.  THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK MORE LIKE THE DESSERTS I AM USED TO ARE ON LEVEL 2, SO I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH.  I HAVE MADE A GOOD MOUSSE DESSERT USING SUGAR FREE CHOC PUDDING AND CREAM, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE AN ALMOST LEVEL ONE.  I PERSONALLY WOULDNT WASTE THE $ ON THIS BOOK. 
 Characters are flat. I don't really care about the Art and Music.  Murder mystery was so boring I found out that I didn't care who killed him.  Read 3/4 of the book and shut the pages 
 "Mr. Mani" is the story of a Sephardic family over a couple centuries, told via one side of conversations, and going backwards in time.  Both devices are hoary. I didn't believe for a second that the characters were of their own time. They were not even three-dimensional moderns. The prose alternates between plodding and precious. It's beyond me why this novel is well-respected 
 This book began by raising some very interesting questions about "mother love" versus "father love", that is, about the need for a person to experience both unconditional love and earned love. I eagerly bought the book, logically believing these provocative questions would be answered at the end of the book, but IMHO Kushner wimps out. He writes that there really isn't any difference at all, despite the fact that he outlined significant differences earlier in the book.  I won't be buying Kushner's latest book, which was released earlier this month (although I'll probably read parts of it in a bookstore). I find myself growing a bit tired of his technique of profiling one Old Testament character per book. (He's profiled Job, the writer of Ecclesiastes/King Solomon, Jacob/Israel in this book, and Moses in his latest.) Kushner writes really well, and I'd like to see him break out of this mold and deliver some truly original ideas 
 This Tech readout is more of the same churned out of the FASA factory. More mechs than you can shake a stick at, and hopefully they get you to buy the overpriced minitatures. However, that being said, there are a lot of mechs here, enough for even the most ruthless player. Thankfully though they left out the "Typhoon", and "Gauzzilla" mechs. Mechforce North America rubber stamped pieces of junk that get away totally from the spirit of the game. Good background information on the mechs however, and good illustrations. How does Duane Loose do it 
 She nicked that bit about the marbles in the medicine cabinet from a hidden-camera practical-jokes television show that appeared about fifteen years ago. 
 The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic. You have a regular burner, and a small grill at the same time. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor. Out of the box, paint was flaking, and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit. The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part.  The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit.  Reading other reviews I can't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number: the bad kind and the good kind. If so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety.  
 After I purchased and opened this product, I have found that Macally does NOT offer updated drivers for intel based macs.   Buyers beware, this will not work with your Intel based Mac 
 This book is a great example of the problem with the contemporary left: a paralysis by analysis by academics too comfortable in their lofty ivory tower to actually take any political action. There was a time when left intellectuals were more concerned class struggle than making tenure or getting published in the most trendy post-modern theory journal. Try to imagine the look on the face of any working class Joe sipping beer at a sports bar when confronted with the language this book is couched in. Ivory tower Marxist serve as an "outlet" for revolutionary energy in a capitalist society. The ivory tower radicalism espoused by this book is nothing but another system of control. 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Are you sure this is not a misprint?  Who in their right mind would pay $114.00 for a DVD? 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 There are moments in you life that you know you will remember forever: the moment after a nuclear explosion; the assasination of John F. Kennedy; the sinking of the titanic.  None of these momnets compare with the horror of  the experience of reading Mr. Bassett's book, "Real Life."  There  are no real people in this book.  No real emotions are explored.  The  premise upon which the book is written is flawed.  The science wildly  improbable.  If I was trapped on a desert island and this was the only book  that I had with me I would wish for the mercy of blindness to deliver me  from this evil 
 If you're really hard-up for a laugh, you might like this flick. But you'll also have to be happy with the following qualities: Slapstick, stupid, forced humor, poor acting, mediocre dialog. It's obviously low budget. And it just isn't funny, which is bad since it's suppose to be a romatic comedy. Don't buy it. And don't waste your time renting it. Try Mambo Italiano instead 
 After the FIRST use the teflon coating started to bubble up and after the FIRST WEEK it looked as if were decades old!   It looks nice on the outside, makes consistently perfect hard or soft boiled eggs BUT it looks like crap after a week 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 The History channel should be ashamed of this effort.  I have seen the PBS broadcasts and indeed the original broadcasts on NBC in the 50"s  All were quality B&W films.   This DVD has, aside from the audio problems mentioned in other reviews,  has muddy, low contrast, all gray images commensurate with 10th generation dubs. Viewing and listening are an unpleasant experience 
 When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced 
 There is really nothing new to be gotten from this book or any improvement to any old recipes. Some of the instructions are confusing and some pictures such as the chess pie refer you to page that has a different recipe than what is pictured. Nothing to be learned here with this book. Very disappointing 
 I used an earlier version of this book as an undergrad.  I am happy with the experience and the knowledge I gained of the theoretical underpinnings of electronics.  On the other hand, it never really helped me take the next step in using or applying the information.  I kept the book as it was one I felt would help me long term and I liked it, but once working in electonics, I find it really wasn't useful.  Most of the problems I see on a day to day basis were never addressed and the methods I learned in graduate level classes were much more powerful.   I do wish more students had the underlying knowledge of electonics, so many engineers these days don't know why or how semiconductors work!   The way I saw the book is that it teaches one how to drive a car by exlaining the gas pedal, the engine, the transmission, the tires, and the road.   Great to know, but it never gets around to clearly saying why something is the way it is or clearly summarizing the important points.  
 What a waste of time and money. This book is the farthest thing from the travel book that I expected. There should have been some indication that this book was about Florence as a haven for gay men and women. Very little was written about what to see in Florence but many references to sodomy and homosexuality. In fact, an entire chapter of this very tiny book was about the  homosexual history of Florence. That would have been fine if it were marketed as that type of book but the jacket doesn't give any warning. I was very disappointed.. 
 The book is very Mac-centric. While a few charts include windows key commands all screen shots are Mac screens and look VERY diferent from Finale98 for Windows. Only in guitar chord creation does this book venture  past the online and in-the-box documentation of the program itself 
 Once again it seems another jazz books of regurgitated titdbits has forgotten most of the woman in jazz. True Ella, Sarah, Billie, Carmen and the likes are here -- but for the most part this is a good ol' boys jazz review book. Was also VERY disappointed to note that their selected discography hasn't changed much since the last editio 
 I'm a fan of LaBute's. I loved "In the Company of Men," "Your Friends and Neighbors," and thought "Fat Pig" was pretty darn good. But this latest play seems a retread--and a dull one at that. This interracial love triangle with its unreliable narrator is too clever by half.   I'm not the kind of reader who thinks we must "like" the characters but don't we have to find them interesting, at least? How about a rewrite, Neil. Did a little deeper and stop relying on the "surprise" ending to make it all work. You're becoming the M. Night Shymalan of plays, without the cool special effects 
 Okay, so Bertha Mason was treated awfully in Charlotte Bront?'s Jane Eyre. Point taken. But Jean Rhys does an exceptionally poor job at defending Mr Rochester's first wife, who she christens Antoinette Cosway. In Wide Sargasso Sea, Antoinette/Bertha can hardly be called a heroine. Instead she comes off as a spineless young woman who is only too eager to become a victim of her English husband. He in turn is convinced that he is actually the victim of their unfortunate marriage. With this, Rhys creates two exceptionally unsympathetic characters, who you wish would just get up and do something about their situations, instead of wallowing in self-pity and rum. I'm sure there was actually a strong woman behind the raving lunatic that Bertha Mason became, but Jean Rhys hasn't shown her 
  Jim Ross, A Statistical Approach to Betting the Horse Races, Second Edition (self-published?, 2004)  Ross releases the second edition of A Statistical Approach to Betting the Horse Races, rearranging the data and adding just under four thousand races over twenty-three tracks. While I realize that getting a large enough data sample to come up with a truly comprehensive version of this book would be a Herculean task-- it would certainly require a decent-sized full-time staff-- some of the tracks represented here are a bit confusing given some of those left out; Evangeline Downs, Penn National, Ruidoso Downs, and Beulah Park are all included, while Belmont Park is nowhere to be found. This, I would imagine, leads to a large number of confused Belmont players.  The book runs just over one hundred seventy-five pages, which is reasonable for a racing book of this price, but over half the book is nothing but charts and graphics. While there are some interesting ideas that warrant further study to be found within these pages, the fact of the matter is that the real meat to be found here could have filled a much smaller book-- or, perhaps, a sixteen-page pamphlet.  If you're a collector of horse racing books, you might want to add this one to your collection; otherwise, you can safely avoid it. * 
 I have been reading the Navajo mysteries for the first time, in chronological order. I was sad when each ended, and could barely wait to get the next one from the library...until this one. The plot is convoluted and far fetched with a LOT of holes, and I found the setting ugly and depressing, especially the character of the hit man. (This is the second hit man Hillerman's given us who owes it all to his unhealthy attachment to a disfunctional mama.  Hmmmm...)  I skimmed the last 4 chapters because I was tired of both the book and the setting...I just wanted it to see how it ended and be done with it because I was not enjoying the experience as I usually do.  So as other reviewers have advised: don't start here 
 This book expects a lot out of students, thereby requiring instructors to work even harder at presenting the material in a meaningful and understandable way.  Unless students have previously had precalculus (including trigonometry), or had a thorough preparation in algebra, this text will be highly confusing and discouraging to most of them.  It is an inadequate preparation for calculus at best, as it completely omits many key concepts that will be necessary for the study of calculus.  This is a well written book for mathematicians, but not for students just grappling to learn this material.  Unfortunately, there are those who are involved with the "Calculus Reform" that believe this "Applied Approach" is the best approach.  If people really wants to learn about applied mathematics, they need not look any further than physics 
 J.A. Jance's novel, Outlaw Mountain, is one of the worst books i have read in years.  Her characters and their dialogue, both inward and spoken, are completely unbelievable.  The storyline is convoluted and riddled with useless drama which is completely unnecessary for the plot.  The fact that I was able to finish this book was an act of pure discipline.  I am a worse person just for having consumed this book.  I would advise anyone who is considering purchasing or reading this book to save their time and money 
 Being a new Blu-ray owner I was anxious to acquire some high resolution material.  This was one of three discs in my first order and a quick lesson in shopping blind.  For full disclosure I will reveal that we only watched about the first half of the feature before hitting "eject".  At best, 10% of this program was high res, mostly familiar footage of ground based NASA training, etc.  All of the shuttle lift-off and orbital footage was standard res or worse, presented as a documentary and fully narrated.  Very disappointing and a waste of money.  The other two discs in the order were quite nice. 
 Instead of "every kind of writing," the subtitle should say "fiction and personal narrative." Some of the big names have interesting things to say, but this book is mostly little-known short story writers telling you that Mark Twain is great, people in their families were great story tellers, well-developed characters in stories are important, read a lot, humor writing doesn't get the respect it deserves, and then again, Mark Twain is great. And, that you can't have great humor writing without great writing, but there's plenty of mediocre writing in this book, like too many cutesy parenthetical asides.   There are some interesting points here and there, but the price of a used copy will be more in line with the book's value. 
 I rented the CD book from the library. I do not write long reviews but instead like to point out the major flaws or good points.  The storyline is OK. However the sheer banality of the diaglogue is almost staggering. The average emotional and mental IQ of the characters is extremely low. These people are not interesting!!!!!!! 
 "When Calls the Heart" had absolutely no depth whatsoever.  The character's were one dimensional and predictable.  But, thankfully, there was hardly any religious preaching, which I was thankful for.  The chapters were very short, and were written as if they were from a child, with no meaning.  And, as always, the ending came up so quickly, and ends so abruptly.  If you're looking for a mindless read, then this is for you.  If not, then I do not recommend 
 The book is slightly bigger than the manual that came with the camera, but most of the content are simply paraphrasing what is in the original manual.  i was looking forward to learning advanced skills or tricks that are not discussed in the camera manual, but i'm sorely disppointed, even the few sample pictures in the book are in black and white only.  i personally don't find the book useful.  
 The title appears to be a ripoff of Pete Hammil's book, "Why Sinatra Matters". A more accurate title to this book would be, "Why New Orleans Matters to Me". Almost all of the author's reasons are subjective. He likes the Mardi Gras Indians, the neighborhood restaurants and music clubs. So what? What is the objective significance of them? The author mentions but does not evaluate the objective effects of the high crime rate, welfare dependence and the political corruption. He also dodged the objective fact that before Hurricane Katrina 40% of city residents could not read and write and 50% refused to work. Does New Orleans matter to him because a majority of its residents are stupid and lazy? The truth is that New Orleans has mattered for one objective reason: its geographical location near the mouth of the Mississippi River. The U.S. cannot effectively compete in the global economy without a safe and secure New Orleans. If coastal erosion does not inundate the city, it will continue to matter. But this book will not 
 This review refers to the translation by William Creasy. Several have tried to bring the devotional classic, "The Imitation of Christ" into the twentieth century and all have failed. I can think  of few  devotional books as morose and melancholy as this one. I have attempted to  read it on several occasions due to its reputation throughout Christian  history but have never been able to draw any strength or comfort from a  work whose message consists of these themes: "Abandon the world and  hate it", "Withdraw from all people into yourself",  "Think often of death and judgment". This is Christianity!  It  sounds like the scribblings of a manic-depressive in need of Prozac and  some long term attitude adjustment!  A real downer. Not something that  would encourage me to continue with my day to day reading and meditation  time. Where is the encouragement and refreshment that one would expect from  devotional reading? How in the dickens is someone supposed to draw strength  from a book that seems designed to rob you of all positive emotions and  hopes? The emphasis here is on everything dark and depressing that one can  imagine. It is my opinion that one would have to distort the message of the  New Testament to an incredible degree to make the message of "The  Imitation" be in synchrony with it. One further point: while the cross  of Jesus is mentioned over and over and over in this, I do not recall a  single mention of the Resurrection of Jesus-which shows how distorted this  is if it fails to see any point worth mentioning to the central mystery of  Christianity, right 
 Just a rehash of the current fad thinking on compensation. Got to question the credentials of the author---PhD in sociology,  background in social work, never worked in the field, yet is on the b-school staff? With this social work background, one can see the roots for the bizarre "stretch" idea here---assign every employee a compensation case worker??? With its  outrageous tuition , the b-school students deserve someone with an apprpriate background. I liked the large font and graphics 
 This book is totally useless.  I've contacted several places listed in the book to no avail.  This will NOT help you make money and does not lead to any "free" money anywhere.  Keep the money you have 
 I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.  
 Drab storytelling at its worst, but to compare this to Capote's In Cold Blood is to insult a truly great writer. Those who are so impressed with this amateurish work should go back and read no more than the first chapter of In Cold Blood and then reconsider your flattering comments.  The outstanding reviews of this mediocre work indicate that, aside from the classics, there remains a paucity of worthy literary fiction. 
 I got into AFI with the release of Art of Drowning, which is a fantastic album.  My girlfriend at the time had Black Sails in the Sunset and even though I didn't really get into it then, I now think it rivals AOD.  AFI has always been a band to look towards the future and embrace a sense of progress (this is highly commendable).  These two albums, which formed my introduction to AFI, now stand as the mid-part of their career.   The band has always refused to simply fall into the groove of what's cool.  They've always been unique.  Their first two albums came out of their intense interest in the 80's and early 90's hardcore punk scene.  Davey Havoc may have summarized the roots of the albums best when he says, "Ever since I can remember I wanted to be in a hardcore band," at the beginning of the "He Who Laughs Last" video.  These albums are full of the intensity of the early hardcore scene.  When the band emerged into this middle era the music was totally fresh and delightfully dark (it was there in the early days, though, in songs like Brownie Bottom Sundae).  These middle albums (haloween ep and self-titled included) also had an intensity and an energy that blew away their old sound.  Moreover, I've yet to hear a band in the world of punk (past and present) who's music rivals this intensity.  I appreciate the two newer albums on an artistic level; they continue to break the mold (the goth glam influence is pretty cool).  Besides, who can say they didn't see them foreshadowed in certain moments on Black Sails and AOD.  But, personally, it's pretty difficult to listen to Decemberunderground.  AFI deserves all the respect in the world but I don't feel much of the fire of the old days.     
 Zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on Mafia, and on this tour.  Its really hard to take, and I'm glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on Shot To Hell.  BLS are a great group, but Zakk's persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles Blessed Hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the CDs.  Stoned and Drunk and Funeral Bell are critically altered to the point where I had to skip them.  I'm actually starting to suspect that Zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect, because I can't imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way.  A few tunes sung this way I can handle, buts its total overkill on this DVD.  The behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because Zakk is a funny guy 
 It seems like a good idea... 'Las Vegas Hillbillys,' a kind of a 'Krush Groove' for the possum pie and moonshine set, starring Jayne Mansfield and Mamie van Doren.  Duelling blonde bombshells, right?  Ah, no.  Van Doren is looking sad and puffy in this film as a 'tough' but disinterested saloon singer, longing for better days when she was straining angora sweaters and scratching out the eyes of good girls everywhere.  Jayne Mansfield sports a series of tentlike grandma dresses of the sort later found adorning the fashionable Weezie Jefferson, reading from cue cards with a kind of breathy, clueless abandon which is probably quite fetching when she's not dressed in a potato sack.  One can imagine her on her rendezvous with destiny, thinking, 'Oh no, we're about to slide underneath that semi truck!  But at least I won't have to think about 'Las Vegas Hillbillys' anymore.'  Between the two of them, they don't get more then seven minutes' screen time.  This movie is ostensibly a musical, in the sense that there is music in it, consisting of fifteen- or twenty-minute blocks of bad lip-synching (in an 85-minute film) which do nothing to advance the plot, such as it is.  Watch for Bill Anderson's all-KGB-agent backup band. 'We are American high-fashion models.'  I gave this movie a whole two stars because they *can* sing, after all... give them a break.  Richard Kiel makes a surprise appearance as, can you guess? a thug.  He actually has dialogue in this film, of a sort, and in watching his performance you really get a sense that unenthusiastically bunny-hopping between cable cars in 'Moonraker' represented the pinnacle of his acting career.  The plot: Woody Weatherby contemplates stardom, inherits a debt-ridden saloon from his uncle, goes to Vegas, tries to run the place, has a twenty-minute nap.  In the last ten minutes Aunt Clem magically fixes everything and starts a cream pie fight.  Van Doren kisses Ferlin Husky, thereby completing her descent to the innermost circle of Hades.  The End.  There was supposedly a sequel to this, 'Hillbillys in a Haunted House,' but I frankly am afraid to watch it.  Be my guest 
   I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality 
 I saw Jonathan on QVC and was really impressed with the claim that the Moisturizing Conditioner was great for dry/damaged hair.  He also said that his products don't strip the color out of hair like some of the brands on the market.  I color and highlight my hair and wanted something that would protect it.  What a disapointment.  The conditioner bottle is horrible at dispensing even a small amount of conditioner.  I had to remove the lid.  Then, it's like paste...doesn't seem to go through the hair..even after 3 minutes.  When I tried to comb my hair out, it was like a birds nest.  I had to put a spray leave in conditioner, by another line, in my hair just to comb through it.  I ordered it from QVC...and it's going back 
 I did not like this set at all.  It's even worse when compared to what Alice In Chains released.  These songs, as previously mentioned, are  plodding.  Jerry's vocals don't sound good, either.  Boggy Depot was MUCH better than this.  Get that CD if you want to hear what Jerry can do 
 Although the book and information is helpful and thoroughly useful,  this is not what I was looking for.   I am having a hard time finding -  a social area - party area - for outdoors to build along side of the pool.   We find we need an (approx 25 x 12) area  for indoor/outdoor use when we entertain 
 I'm no idiot (I have an honours degree in psychology and an MBA) but this book was completely incomprehensible to me.  If I lived in the States I would have returned it!  I suspect only readers with a scientific education can appreciate this book - and maybe they'll find it excellent - but it definitely is not for the generalist 
 I bought this frame in Jan. '07 and the screen burned out March '07.  I returned it and the newest one burned out last night - April '07.  This product needs a redesign - the screens don't work for long. 
 I was taught to read this way. It was very detrimental to my later emotional, social and even intellectual development. You are not giving your children an edge up by teaching them to read too early. I feel very strongly that this is a very bad idea.  Let them be children. Read to them, and if they pick it up early without flashcards, great, but if you just read to them enough they will become good readers when it's time. Please. Don't do this to your kids. 
 In the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them. I wish I had known this before. Now I have to waste about $20 in shipping to return it.  DO NOT BUY FOR BODY FAT MEASUREMENT 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 I've had email communications with Koreto and found him to be arrogant, surley, and intolerant of anyone who doesn't agree with him.   Also, I'm familiar with some of his "experts" who post their drivel on Koreto's magazine's website. As a financial professional, I wouldn't want anything that they have to offer.  
 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 Healthy? I don't think so. Every meal she uses a lot of olive oil, butter, and salty additives. then writing a recepie for "Hamburger Salad" Basically garden greens from a bag, and a couple fried hamburger patties placed on top of the greens, with cheese on it. Oh my...Quick, easy and "Healthy" meals. I don't think so 
 McCarthy has hit on an interesting idea--television is as much a public as a domestic fixture.  Unfortunately, she doesn't quite follow through.  The book has the air of a dissertation, careful but uninspired in its research as well as in the conclusions the author draws.  In the end, it's a disappointment 
 As the product of a Catholic education, I really wanted to like this film, but I intensely disliked it. 90% of the reason that I disliked this film was because of the young actors. They are absoutely terrible and annoying actors playing terrible and annoying characters! They provoked no sympathy or empathy whatsoever for the characters they portrayed. 
 I love the size (small) and quality of these earrings that were ordered for my 6 year old.  The website picture shows them as a blue and purple color.  When I got them they were pink and green, even the replacements they sent were pink and green.  I have not been happy with their customer service on these and will not order jewelry again.  
 I tried to read this book twice thinking that the first time I didn't give it a chance. I couldn't read anymore after the second decision. It's poorly written and there is nothing revolutionary about it. It's the same old self-help stuff regurgitated and the storyline is even worse. I feel cheated that I paid $1.29 for it at the thrift store. 
    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 I slogged to the end of this book, hoping for some nugget of goodness to redeem it. It never came.  The most glaring problem, among many, is the fact that the South African villains are so cartoonishly evil. Other than delivering AK-47s, they serve only as a miraculous way to sway all the pro-slavery political leaders toward abolition. So the thing feels more like a fairly tale than a serious "what if?".  Many have commended the opening chapters' battle scenes, but it's not as though the world needed a novel to explore what war would be like if massed infantry charged automatic weapons.  There was obviously a lot of painstaking research done on various Civil War units and soldiers, but the silly plot and weak, weak characterizations detract too much 
 I very much enjoyed the movie "Smoke Signals", which was based on Sherman Alexie's "The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven", so it was with substantial anticipation I sat down to read "Indian Killer" as part of a book club selecton.  Right away the language was easy and light, and the first few chapters flew by quickly. However, it soon became evident that the story and the writing in general would not hold its appeal for me.  It is set up as a typical "who-dunnit" albeit with an Indian flair.  We are treated to lots of stereotypical "observations" about Indians and about Whites, all from the other's viewpoint.  There is a desperate attempt to portray political incorrectness; however, it more or less boils down to a meaningless shouting match between people who have in some way been wronged. And the solution to the mystery is a complete let-down. All that for this???  I found various historical tidbits and descriptions of customs interesting; however, I often found myself questioning the amount of objectivity in certain factual-sounding statements. This became especially evident after a certain description of a neighborhood in Seattle mainly inhabited by Scandinavians.  The narrator explains the lack of trees in this neighborhood as a direct result of these Scandinavians' wish to emulate the "monotonous flat landscape of their homelands" and thus they proceded to cut down all the trees. Well, I can hardly think of a more inaccurate way to describe the mountainous and forrested countries of Sweden and Norway... After such a blunder, I became perhaps overly sceptical of the remainder of the story.  From the reviews it seems as if most people agree this is not Alexie's best book, and that his first work is far superior.  I will therefore conclude that I need to read another of his books to appreciate his writing and popularity, and all I can offer is that if you are reading Sherman Alexie for the first time, this is defintely not a recommended start. 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 we saw this movie in Gym class and it is the worest movie any one has ever see 
 This book is a huge disappointment-it leaves out 80%of the movie,and the pictures are only so-so.I don't recommend this boring book to anyone who's a die-hard Poppins fan.All kids will do is look at the pictures to cure boredom,then toss the book aside and forget about it 
 This book was a load of crap. It was nothing but a bunch of boring common knowledge. They name a subject then give you 1/4 of the info on it. And there was only a couple pics of the bond actors except for Pierce who there was a lot of pics of. I think the author is gay for Pierce. The book was written like someone watched the movies once and wrote down a few facts here and there. I love the bond films but I wouldn't pay a dollar for this book 
 This product was only good for about 1 week.  The inner light went out and that makes it very difficult to see. I have written to the company I purchased from, asking them to exchange it and I have yet to receive a response. I'm out the $59.95 I paid for it, plus tax and shipping. It was a birthday present for my fiancee and I am extremey dissappointed and thinking about filing charges against Fine Things II for stealing my money. 
 Oh the HUMANITY!...   First, the obvious: Tara Reid as Cybill? I don't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor, but it is a mystery how that happened.   Secondly, Dominique Swain just didn't act like the Andrea Marr of the book. It seemed like Dominique Swain didn't even read the book before she played Andrea. I also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around, but that's another topic.   The movie didn't have any similarities with the "feeling" of the book, even though the plot was (roughly) similar.   Portia DeRossi as Carla? Ummmm.... maybe?   Selma Blair as Darcy sort of worked.   The only character I felt was well-cast was Todd Sparrow.   Anyhow, I re-read the book a few more times since seeing the movie, to try to recapture the feel of the book (and erase the memory of the movie) 
 MASH is my all time favourite show. As such, I am one of those that bought each season as it came out. I bought mine at a store though and each of mine cost $35 so that's $350 invested so far. When I went looking for season 11, this is what I saw and I still can't believe the absolute disregard Fox must feel for its customers. This is seriously one of the most inconsiderate things I've ever seen a media company do. Those of us buying the seasons as they come out provide the MASH franchise with a revenue stream. To be this unappreciative of that revenue for the past several years is unfathomable to me.  What makes it worse is that there was a very simple solution. All Fox had to do was put a voucher in the regular season 11 box. Send $14.95 and a proof of purchase and receive the bonus features. Simple and plain.  So Fox, if you're paying attention, why should I buy other Fox shows as they are released? By doing this, you have completely eroded my interest in buying Simpsons and other shows since I'm obviously going to be stuck with several shelf-space stealers and no reasonable way to obtain the difference between those and the grand finale box set. Make amends and all will be forgiven, ignore us loyal customers and find there are fewer of us than you would like.  PS. And, no, this isn't whining. This is a vocal objection to being swindled 
 I will start off by admitting I did not read this entire book. As someone who has struggled with severe depression since I was seventeen, the first few chapters made me angry, nauseated, and eventually frightened.  This book will serve to fuel prejudice and contempt towards suicidal people, by claiming it's something that can be averted with a lollipop and a pat on the head; a hysterical search for attention.  Obviously the writer did have serious emotional difficulties; but most suicides are committed by people with physical, chemical, mental illnesses, as dangerous and as un-asked for as diabetes or cancer.  If you want to know WHY, read Kay Redfield Jamison's "Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide".  If you want to know how to make it go away, I still don't have an answer, and I can't trust anyone who claims there's an easy one 
 I read the first 5 series and loved it, 6 and 7 was ok but was getting a little tiring.  Now that I've read 8, I am just going through the motion of finishing out the series (I have a thing about finishing series).    In the first 5 books, Stephanie's bumbling and misadvantures seemed cute and believable.  But by the 8th book you'd think she would tell her cop boyfriend about people threatening her, notify the proper people for help at the appropriate time, and for christ sake don't go into the house the mob boss tell her not to go into!  I honestly don't blame Morelli for not wanting to marry her, and I don't see what her appeal is to both men like Ranger and Morelli.  This almost reinforces the stereotype that men, even smart men like Morelli and Ranger, likes ditzy bimbos.    I have never seen anyone so stupid and so lacking of survival skills.  You'd think after all the death threats and close calls she's had in the first 7 books, Stephanie would carry her gun and not leave it at the cookie jar.  If she hates guns so much, quit being a bounty hunter.  I find myself screaming in the book "move you dummy", this has gotten irritating and annoying to read.    And the love triangle between her and Morelli and Ranger is just unbelievable.  Why would they men want her?  She's a mess and she lacks any real charm that I can see.  She hides secrets from them and I find the way she lusts after one guy soon after the other leaves the room to be dispicable.  If she loves Morelli so bad she should quit all the kissing and petting (oh and having sex) with Ranger.  When Morelli doesn't give her the time of the day because they broke up she goes all pouty and make it sound like it's Morelli's fault.  Hello!  If Morelli found out she had sex with Ranger she'd never see him again 
 Mark Rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in America.  Most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word "interesting" to describe it.  Did they actually read it?  This book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways.  I honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever.  This book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas.  The nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument.    Not only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the US is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the US.  He talks about the US and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and I feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument.  
 I was very excited when I came across this book.  I am both a Christian AND a Star Wars nut.  I began reading this book right away, and it started slow.  I kept reading, hoping it would really dive into some good contrast.  It never came.  I'm sure this guy meant well, but he had a very shallow knowledge of the Star Wars films, and on the Christian side, everything felt like it was from a 5th grade Sunday school class.  I want so badly for this book to be great, but it is not.   I wish I would have written it 
 This might have been an interesting book had the author concentrated more on the plot and less on the peripheral items.  the heroine is pretty, intelligent and has an interesting career and background.  The author, however, appears to place more emphasis on her fashion and sexual exploits than on developing her as a real character.  Is it really necessary to describe every skimpy outfit that the heroine wore and every sexual encounter that she has in order to further the plot?  It appears that the author feels compelled to throw some of this in every few pages in a poorly disguised attempt to hold the reader's interest.  I was also disappointed by the actual plot itself.  Some of the items were so transparent that the reader could predict them pages before the heroine came to the obvious conclusion.  Could anybody not see the significance of the ski lodge?  Other items were never adequately explained and left the reader guessing why the obvious was omitted.  If she knew that the lodge was bugged why didn't she ask Abel if he could provide some evidence?  Hopefully, in future novels, the author will leave out most of the fashion and the sex and build her character into one with the depth to be more interesting 
 It doesn't seem like the other reviewers read the same book that I did.  The book I read consisted of a lot of self-congratulatory essays on Asimov's creation of the Three Laws of Robotics (which aren't really laws, but that's a topic for a different rant) punctuated by a bunch of shaggy-dog stories (MAYBE they were funny in 1955) and a couple of lame science-fiction stories.  I know Dr. Asimov was a brilliant man, but this book in no way offers him tribute to his genius.  For fans only.  Maybe. 
 First, FIX THE DATE IN THE DESCRIPTION AMAZON!!!!!  In spite of Loopy's warning I ordered this book in hopes he had just received old inventory. Wrong! I received the same 1995 book and when I complained to Amazon they sent me a replacement. Another 1995 book. While the information in the book appears good, it's describing conditions over 10 years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream. The Clark Fork, for example, is described as "teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin." My online research has indicated the Clark Fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide I would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip.  If this book were up to date I would give it at least 4 stars. But considering the age I would recommend you pass and search for other sources 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 I bought this book because I am switching from Windows to Linux on my home network.  I thought it might be quicker to learn the ins and outs with the book vs. surfing from place-to-place on the web.  My experience with the book is not that great--it never provides enough information on any subject to answer the question I have.  I always have to resort to the internet for enough information to solve the problem of the day.  It might be o-k for general Linux information, but it won't get you up and running as a system administrator on a home network 
   Like many others, I first got acquainted with Howards work through Conan, and lamented the "readability coating" later added to his work by other authors (L. Sprague de Camp, Lynn Carter, etc). Solomon Kane's adventures forced me to review such opinion: they are dull and immature; a work in progress rather than a finished literary work (even by pulp fiction standards).    In Conan's stories, Howard's narrative shortcomings are balanced by the fact that they play a role in the the course of the story. Conan brutishness, ethnocentrism and lack of scruples are understandable and even enjoyable in the excellent setting of the Hiborian Age.     In Solomon Kane's saga, instead, the ethnocentric comments of the author seem totally gratuitous, the setting of the stories is unverisimilar, and half of the time one doesn't understand why the character acts like he does. One is willing to do an intellectual parenthesis for a congenial barbarian of a mythical  era, but no so for a somber, socially handicapped and sanctimonious English Calvinst of the XVI century. The character never really connects.  All of the above would be forgivable if the plots were engaging; unfortunately that's not the case, they are far-fetched and uninteresting. The black ink illustrations by Gari Gianni are the best part of the book: they are so good, that they almost succeed in conferring to the poor stories an aura of verisimilitude and decadence, in a way parallel to how Frazetta did with Conan.      In my eyes, this book only for the very fans of Howard's, or some collector who might want to place the rest of his work in context, but it doesn't have much worth per se. But even this endeavor might be frustrated by the poor binding of the book: it literally comes apart in your hands.     Gonzalo Día 
 Coming from someone who was active-duty Navy, and is transitioning into the Army as an officer, I was hoping to find a book that would give a decent cross-section of Army wives, happy and unhappy, to give to my girlfriend and future wife.  Not in this book.  Most military wives are not murdered.  Most military members do not die on missions.  Most combat orientated military members don't die, at least not  recently.  Most military members don't commit suicide.  In fact, all of these groups are in the tiniest of minorities.  This book has nothing to do with Army wives, but a small collection of Army wives of which is the author rehashing her articles on the murders.  She included one other wife who was not murdered, but whose life was a good description of misery.  Not one of the wives had a positive experience.  Not one.  Decent book when taken into context, but to imply these women are indicative of Army wives and their experiences is intellectually dishonest.  I also think the author, despite being the wife of an Army officer and from an Army background, hates the military 
 Loren Michels ruins most things he touches.  they left out the "Hot Tub" sketch, where eddie play's as the late, great James Brown.  it may be one of THE most funny sketches in the history of television!!!!  I could see that thing 100 times and i would still laugh as hard as the first time seeing it! i stand buy the greatness of that sketch, SNL was riding the Eddie Murphy thing all the way to the bank ( the show would most likley been canceled, in my opinion, the show was unwatchable without him an piscapo teamed up). then to make this thing worse is that the VHS version had zero Gumby sketches in it ( still great without it thought). i see they have a Gumby sketch in the dvd version, i think "oh, cool, a Gumby dammit segment", but it ends up being one of the lamest one's around.  what, they didn't want to pay piscapo the royalties for showing the one where Gumby goes on Letterman (Piscapo as letterman)?   do everyone a favor and don't purchase this watered down version....Delirious just came out. get that instead. that is GARUNTEED to make u laugh! this dvd....meeeeh! 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 This book is terrible in addition to being ridiculously expensive ($108 to be exact).  I had to buy it for an MBA course in Managerial Accounting and found it to be extremely confusing, without structure and ambiguous.  There are numerous errors, omissions, and the examples are not clear at all.  It's really too bad such a poor text was chosen because I am certain that others, like myself, have been turned off of management accounting forever.  It's too bad because management accounting is such an integral part of business and deserves much better attention, and clarity than this book provides.  I can't wait to "try" to sell this one.  Definitely not a keeper!  If you have to buy this book for your course, I truly empathize with you 
 I wish they had a space for negative stars, this movie sucks so bad it is painful. Not just a little bit painful either.It's like seeing a hero's funeral.I would rather get a punch in the eye than to ever have to watch this movie again.Darn you Jim Carey...Darn you for ever subjecting the world to such horror.After watching this movie, I think it is a miracle from God that anyone ever gave you a second chance to redeem yourself.You should thank God every day that you got a second chance.Oh yeah and the next time you get twenty million bucks for making a movie, please try to buy every copy of this movie in existance....please.                Thank Yo 
 A friend of mine handed me this one while I was convalescing and I loved it at the start. The coming of age tale of an art student during his first year of college, it had me laughing myself silly at times and greedily lapping up the aphorisms and insights into mid-twentieth century life that it offered. All the self-absorbed leftish cant of our current academic elite may be found aborning here, in the person of the enigmatic Gary Cooperesque arts instructor Winter Sorbeck and in the antagonistically brilliant arts student, who despises the ordinary, little Miss Himmillsy Dodd. But about two thirds of the way through the book bogs down, particularly when our hero gets the goods on his arrogant professor, and the story starts to trail off to an inconclusive and remarkably unsatisfying end. Sorbeck, who seemed so powerful a character at the outset comes across as a bit of a self-destructive fool, though it seems we are not intended to take him for that by the author, and Miss Dodd solves the class's final problem in a way that only the narrator seems able to grasp. Most peculiar of all is her complete indifference, and even anger, toward our hero for having saved her from the tender ministrations of the madcap frat boys whom she has thoughtlessly baited while in their lair. Instead of gratitude for having been whisked away from the hulk who had her at his mercies, she appears genuinely annoyed with her rescuer instead. Are we to presume she actually sought the experience of being raped or meant to sacrifice herself on the altar of these "Greeks" in some odd form of performance art? The enraged demolition of Baby Laveen which follows her rescue seems to take all the sense out of the tale and the end leaves one merely scratching one's head. After having recommended this one to others as I read it, I was forced to recant at the end. Who really cares about these self-absorbed, self-satisfied college kid rebels who are so convinced they're better than everyone else anyway? As to the graphics (since the author is a graphics designer by trade), I have to add that I found some of the cover art in my edition more distracting than meaningful and the technique of rolling text over from page to page altogether unhelpful. If you want someone to read something then print it so reading is easy. Otherwise you're just jerking the reader's chain which is pretty much all this book, which began so well, ended up doing. -- SWM   
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 If you speak Spanish, you will be dismayed to hear how bland and shapeless his poems sound in English.  Speaking of bland, the singing and music here is dullsville.  With so many great Brazilian singers, why not listen to some old Joao Gilberto, or Joao's daughter Bebel, or Marisa Monte or Caetano Veloso.  If you want the poetry of Neruda, reading it is more satisfying.  This is a terrible combination of music and poetry. (Later comment: I listened to this cd again and I probably had unfair expectations and was unduly harsh.  It's a pretty recording and Souza can sing...it still all kind of sounds the same, but 3 stars instead of 1. 
 I wasted two days on the book's project code, only to realize that they do not function. After downloading the code from Wrox's website and trying to use that code, it didn't function either 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell.  Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning.  Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle?  The acting in this movie is "meh", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part.  The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you.  You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable.  
 Unless you're into spamming folks, who filter out junk mail anyway, you won't find much value in this book. Each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email (spam) campaign in order to get recognition (and thus advertise to the reader). 
 Skip this one.  It's horrible.  I bought it just before a long flight and didn't have anything else to read.  "I chose poorly."  What kind of author involves his political views and disdain for Christianity in a book called Big Weather?  Well, Mark Svenvold does.  For your money, you get a big dose of Svenvold's personal philosophies packaged with a backdrop of high brow cultural references.  Who is this guy?  And, why should we listen to his rambling pontifications?  I thought I was buying a book about Big Weather!!  Svenvold is also extremely insulting.  He describes one fellow he met as having a receding hairline comparing it to a glacier retreating.  Come now!  Was that necessary?  Oklahomans in particular get an extra helping of insults.  Svenvold lets loose with unflattering comments about a number of individuals.  Most of them were just answering his questions about weather.  Here is a small dose.  Svenvold describes a college student storm chaser: "She had an oval face, a smallish mouth, and large, wide cheekbones that made her look as if she were peering shyly and a little fiercely out from behind a tribal mask, if such a mask wore mascara."  It gets worse.  That is just one I turned to quickly.  Save your money.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.  I have no idea how it managed the ratings is has received.  Still tempted?  Pick it up in a bookstore and read pages 232-237 (soft cover).  If that strikes you as an exciting read about "big weather" then go for it.  This book is for you 
 Dawes starts with the conclusion he wants to prove, and then selects only studies which agree with it.  We call this begging the question, or affirming the consequent.  He ignores myriad studies, including those conducted by NIMH, which prove that Cognitive Therapy IS effective.  Dr. Aaron Beck and Dr. Albert Ellis have pioneered new forms of therapy.  To dismiss them out-of-hand is short-sighted 
 "When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'.  
 This book is dangerous.  It does not present an overall method (or even practical starting points) for treating people with depression. Throughout the passages the author seems to be speaking to himself and his dead sons as much as to the reader.  It gives readers 30 anecdotal and ideological glimpses into the disorder and it's treatment. This probably does more harm than good in the long run.   I think many readers are likely to start practicing arm-chair psychiatry . . . "it is reasonable to confront them [patients] with the selfishness and anger implied in any act of self-destruction . . ." What a dangerous (angry? guilty?) generalization!  Dealing with depression takes a "patient-centered" approach. Confrontation MAY have it's place, but later in THERAPY. And even then being dependent on multiple factors (patient-doctor relationship, in-patient vs. out-patient, support networks, patient himself).   Someone suffering from depression may get useful insights out of this book. It should NOT be read by family or friends looking for help dealing with a depressed person. 
 I've no idea why this album is commonly justified as an "experiment". In the context of music, an experiment means either to innovative or test sounds. This album is antonymous with the said definition... In Flames knew that by applying uncharacteristic metalcore riffs to their music, they'd gain more mainstream exposure, and lose older fans. They didn't need to "experiment" to validate that hypothesis. I'd rather stab out my eyes or post at Gaia than hear this album's lukewarm "power-ballads" again, overflowing with superfluous electronics and overly-layered attempts at whiney vocals hooks. Fans of this album keep an oblivious ear, drowning out the reality of how utterly mediocre this album really is with loud mantras of "EVOLUTION!!! PROGRESSION!!!" You can almost detect how insecure, and eventually hostile they grow as they mindlessly defend the band. As previously explained, this is not progression. When this album isn't sterile Gothencore, it pathetically attempts to dig up some of the life that made classics like Jester Race and Clayman so great by tossing in a contrived twin guitar harmony. That may be enough to pacify some drooling idiots, but not me.  Miserable CD, let's try to forget it now. - Thus says the Pellington 
 I've been a fan of the GGDs since the late eighties and was hoping that they would get back to their roots and start making great garage rock again but it seems they are just too old and now care more about sales instead of where they came from.  It's sad to see this happen to a good band, maybe they should talk to Trent Reznor and see how a 40 yr old guy can still rock 
 The ends are comming off this cable doesn't meet the normal Belkin standards 
 omg... let me say it again,, OMG!!  wuts up with this movies  the first broly movie was freeking sweet but man the creaters must have been bored and said , " hmm i feel like making a brolly movie... yeah i got 10 minutes let me make it real fast"  sersiously this made no sense.,.. i mean first off we all know how strong broly is.... having said that  videl should have been killed off instantly after broly attacked her and the same with kid gotenn and trunks..    the fighting just was so slow and stupid and  brolly mostly jsut hovered and didnt do anything really... bah im getting annoyed just typing this...   for all you DBZ fans  stay far  far faaar away from this one and just stick to either the first broly movie or get like the  lord slug movie  they are both way better!!!! 
 I had a pattern for a while of reading one really great, original Layman book and then reading one generic, vapid, and unrealistic one. This pattern continued through the reading of about ten books as I explored his work and sadly, Blood Games, falls firmly into the second category. While it's not as stupidly infuriating as "Come out Tonight," the author takes a sheer thin premise and does exactly nothing with it, as though taking the camping trip from hell, (done quite well in "Darkness, tell us,)" and throwing it into purgatory. If you didn't mind the lack of supernatural and somewhat slow pace of "Among the missing," then you might like this one, but I found it too long by half, with characters that grew paper thin instead of taking on greater substance as every other chapter flashed back to their previous life together. Do yourself a favor and put this one low on the list, after you've done all the great standby's: "Traveling Vampire Show," Island, In the Dark, and Body Rides." 
 This is a great cookbook with easy recopies that everyone in my family will eat.  It is rare to find a cookbook where every recipe you make is a winner but this book is the one 
           This book is about as pointless as majoring in Sociology.  Its the most obviously basic stuff that anyone with even half a working brain can figure out.  Each line in this book is like a greeting card of lame industry superficial insights like "there's always a possibility that hard earned success will disappear as quickly as it materializes." (pg107) and "Every artist is only as sucessful as the most recent accomplishment." (the very next line on pg 107)           All of this would be OK, in fact I expect it in a book about the music industry.  But this book is really just 250 pages of THOSE TWO LINES written in different verse and/or syntax.  I think the writers of this book said to themselves "instead of writing a book about management, lets see if we can figure out how to write the same thing in more than two thousand ways."  Honestly, these guys should be in the Guiness Book Of World Records, but NOT writers of a useful, helpful, artist management book.  
 My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO.  I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it. 
 I was not thrilled with this work.  Here's why:  The movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow.  It is beautifully filmed with great costumes, colors, imagery but the acting is so bland, almost weak!  Christ, I wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate! The sex scenes were boring.  Maybe i should make films!  This is frustrating!! It had it's moments so, 2 stars.  Wish someone would make a movie about 'Narcissus and Goldmund' or 'Cloister and the Hearth'.  Now That would be Passionate! (unless Amblin or Touchstone did it). 
 paid by the word!  This book is well over 1100 pages too long! Your time can be better spent elsewhere 
 i found this book somewhat, well, less that i had expected it to be.  i like WWII books, but just couldn't get into this one 
 I started off this story with great expectations but am only half way through it and am forcing myself to finish it - only because I spent good money on it!    The story just drags and drags. It's so slow that if I weren't reading the ebook version then I would be skipping pages. I don't like the heroine and I definitely can't stand the hero. She is utterly ridiculous with her head in the clouds living in a dream world. She's supposed to be so enamored of anything that has to do with legends (whining about how she wants to live a legend of her own) but as soon as she is actually involved in one in the form of the St. Legers she balks and wants out. Instead of confronting life she'd rather "fall in love with" a ghost than face a flesh and blood man that she's actually attracted to because he doesn't come with the exact legend that she wants in the way that she wants it.  Truly annoying.   As for the hero...I can't stand a whining, crying, man. He's supposed to be such a strong, authoritative, character but he spends all of his time whining about his horrible life and how he's such a horrible person. He's handsome, rich, heir to the title, respected by his neighbors, has a rich history, and magical powers...gee, poor guy. Ok, so he's a little shell-shocked from fighting Napolean and he had a bad love affair when he was 18. He's almost thirty years old. Get over it! Grow up! My goodness, it makes me want to smack the guy. The only believable thing about it is that he feels guilty about his brother's leg being crippled. But he's constantly complaining about the fact that his brother saved him when he really wanted to die; how he didn't deserve to be saved; how he's not good enough to be his father's son; how he's reprehensible; he's a wastrel; blah-blah-blah. Not to mention his intimate friendship with a man who I can tell half-way through the book will probably be the bad guy - a friendship that he insists on despite all good common sense and the opinions of all the people he keeps saying that he's not worthy of. I wonder why? Lastly, is the "love" he supposedly feels for Rosalind. I don't understand why he loves her. It's obvious why she "loves" the ghost - but not him yet - while he's already proclaiming that he loves her. Other than the St. Leger legend there hasn't been enough between them for him to "love" her.   I truly hope this book has a redeeming ending - but I doubt it. I'm more than halfway through it and was so disgusted that I had to voice an opinion. This is the first time I've ever written an opinion without having finished the book. Don't waste your time or your money. I won't be buying any more of this author's books.   For an excellent historical romantic read with supernaturally gifted heros and heroines (while not straying into the paranormal subgenre) I highly recommend Virginia Henley - Tempted, The Border Hostage, Raven and the Rose, etc. - she writes rich historical novels several cuts above the rest for depth and detail. I'm having a heck of a time finding other contemporary authors of her caliber. (Except Judith McNaught - always trust a Judith McNaught)      
 What was I expecting when I picked up this book? Nothing much really and that is exactly what I got. In that light this book lived up to its expectations fully.  These kind of books by racist authors are emblematic of the sad truth in the world we now find ourselves in.  Under the guise of "terrorism" anyone with the most racist of viewpoints can disguise his anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, anti-progressive, anti-justice views with ease without the slightest of criticism because as the rightwing justification goes "now its not a time for being politically correct, we are in war."  Thus war becomes this ultimate catch phrase under whose umbrella a racist can find refuge and the non-partisan independent is confused and silenced.  "War on drugs" "War on terror" "War on fascists" "War on freedom" what does it all mean? To a conservative: simply survival! (a do or die, apocalyptic clash that is the ultimate fear inducer of the populace to win them over. A dangerously clever PR strategy.)  What would be normally considered morally repugnant now becomes socially acceptable and racist authors like Robert Spencer, David Horowitz, Daniel Pipes, Jamie Glazov, and their neocon ilk such as FrontPage, National Review take full advantage of that fear induced populace to further their selfish ratings and venomous viewpoint.  Venomous considering if everytime we switch "Arab" and "Muslims" preceding the oft-derided term radical, fundamentalist, fascist, with Jewish fascist, radical, fundamentalist; their views would immediately are rightfully barked down as anti-Semitic.  But that is not the case with these neocons and their Islamophobic books. Their goal in this book seems clear.   To slowly and deliberately brainwash the populace and get them ready for a "culture clash" whose fruits we are seeing unfold in Iraq, then it'll be Iran (with the exaggerated threat), then Syria.  The exploitation of terrorism by an ignorant populace goes a long way, as the GOP found out in the '02 and '04 elections.   Therefore don't be surprised that with every terrorism 'plot' (which is cropping up due to Iraq and the Israeli war in Lebanon) more seeds of neocon self-rigteousness of "told you so" is being planted to furthering their own political agenda not unlike the Nazi's own political hate campaign against Jews.  If we are caught sleeping at the switch, don't be surprised if America is dragged into another invasion of Iran for the sake of neoconservative's darling Israel. The same arguments are being recycled, "Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism as Saddam was," "Iran is supposedly building nukes" (while ignoring Israel's nukes) "Iran is a threat to its neighbors," (Iran hasn't invaded any of its neighbors since 1600s) "Iran's President Ahmedinejad is Hitler as Saddam was who wants to wipe Israel off the map" (a country who has enough PROVEN nukes to wipe out the entire Middle East and IS a threat to its neighbors as we saw in Lebanon).  If enough people buy the militant, right-wing neocons hate discourse and attack Iran, we will then have only ourselves to blame for letting McCarthyite fear and hatemongers like Glazov, Spencer, FoxNews get the better of American foreign policy.  Iran will make Iraq seem like cakewalk. And for what? For Israel's sake?  It's time to wake up and throw out the Republican hatemongers in the upcoming election to whom war, confrontation, and 'fear therefore secure' is their Modus Operandi. For the sake of our children and our collective future as a prosperous nation currently drowning in trillion of debt 
 This seemed very pretentious, with an unnecessary amount of literary references.  It was convoluted and felt like wading through mud - difficult to get through 
 ...He can't sing and his songs are kinda lame.  Having a famous ne'er-do-well dad and a limitless capacity to try and shock the squares can really only go so far.  I mean, if you really like this record, more power to you.  But it really isn't very well made or all that engaging.  Yes, he might not "sound like everybody else," but that doesn't necessarily make him a good alternative to what's out there 
 I adored Mailer's Naked and the Dead, but I just ditched Harlot's Ghost without finishing it. For starters, Mailer was so ignorant that he wrote that schizophrenia was the name for multiple personality syndrome. In reality, those psychiatric conditions have nothing to do with each other, something Mailer would have learned if he had cared to create believable characters. Instead, he exploited his lazy ideas about schizophrenia to fashion a series of Deux ex machina events. The resulting plot is tiresomely simple: all his characters work for the CIA, they each have two personalities, therefore they can do anything whatsoever BECAUSE THEY ARE CRAZY, and this explains why the CIA sucks. Yawn.. 
 This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on "Ways and Means" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy 
 The lack of someone lurking behind Prince's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the Fargnoli management team. This is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. Musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to Sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. While Prince fans will generally hype this track, the reality is that "4 the tears in your eyes" this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass. Lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121.    
 Don't waste your money on this book. Save it for your equipment. A better choice for a beginner's book is Nightwatch by Terence Dickinson, available from Amazon.com. You should also subscribe to Sky & Telescope magazine and order a free catalog from Orion Telescopes and Binoculars Co. Their Web site URL is telescopes.co 
 After reading the reviews on this book, I decided on the spot to order it.  Although it has many thought-provoking questions in it, they definitely arn't life changing.  It is a decent book, but it didn't meet my  expectations.  If you are a very religious or spiritual person, this may be  your style 
 Folks!! The very purpose of having a laptop gets defeated with this unnecessary add on. If you think you need this then better buy a desktop system and same some real cash.  I do not recommend this 
 The book is decent for an undergraduate course but there are numerous typos throughout the book and some of the HW problems are poorly written.  The poorly written questions gave many of my students problems  because the  wording is confusing.  Treybal is a much better book; unfortunately, it is  a bit outdated and does not have all of the latest separations processes  included.  I will contiue to look for a better book.  I will post the name  of any other books I come across for those who are interested 
 The only pointer I got from this book was that posture and breathing are very important in correcting back and neck problems.  These facts reinforced facts already known.  Better exercises can be found elsewhere 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 I did not like the book because it's a country book. It's about a farmer that loves his farm and his wife. I don't like the animals on the farm or the colors on the pages and the people. They are so little. Thats why I don't like the book.  
 I bought this book expecting a long overdue treatment on one of the most dramatic camapigns of the War between the States. Instead what I got was socio-political fluff that quite frankly has been beat over the heads of tens of thousands of college students for over fifty years. Hence the two star rating. It was, however, well written and the battle narrative (the miniscule one provided by Rable) is actually very good, just far too short for a book claiming to be written about the Fredericksburg campaign and battle. Had this not been stocked in the military history section, it would actually pass as great socio-political history. But since many of us have zero interest in that category... well anyway. "New" Military history is quite frankly an attempt to liberalize and propagandize the last bastion of history we have, military history. If all future War between the States and WWII and Napoleonic and Roman military history books turn out this way... just buy the old classics and re-read them. Don't waste your money on New Mil Hist and certainly don't waste your money on this book. It takes the dead horse of Emancipation Proclomation and beats it to past death into carcass mutilation. Again, this book was supposed to be about Fredericksburg Mr. Rable, not the cause of the war to begin with which by the way unfair taxation and import tarrif laws not slavery. Alas, a different subject for a different time.  I repeat... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Buy O'Reilleys instead. 
 Melissa was just an average gossip reporter for a NYC newspaper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Fortunately her elderly next door neighbor was attacked in her home and left for Mel to find unconscious and barely breathing.  Mel, being the kind, neighborly girl she is, took to taking care of the woman's pets and set to getting in contact with her only living relative.  Her heinous, photographer nephew, Max.  After hearing of his aunt's accident, Max decided it was more important to spend a few weeks in Florida with a supermodel.  In his place, he sent an old college friend who owed him a favor.  John Trent, a trust fund millionaire, was called in to stay at Max's house and pretend to be Max.  After spending time together Mel and "Max" begin to fall i love, creating quite a mix up.  All in all it's a cute book, but I hate that the entire book consists of correspondance through emails 
 I had to read this for my Women's Studies class and I was deeply bored by this trite and unengaging collection of essays of past mistakes by feminists of the past. It is filled with typical man-hating that feminists are stereotyped for. Trust me, if I didn't have to read this for class, I would have never read it at all 
 The story starts out with a lot of promise, which is why it's so disappointing when you get to the preposterously dopey ending. I won't give too much away, but the ending is like something out of a 1930's B-movie. There are so many ways this could have been done that would have been infinitely more plausible (for example, see Richard Morgan's handling of similar issues in a subplot of Broken Angels). I was literally angry as I got to end of the book because it was such a letdown--I was listening to the audiobook version in the car and was actually shouting at the CD player as the ending unfolded.  Hard to believe this is from the same author that gave us The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Unless you're *really* good at suspending disbelief, avoid this one 
 Reading "Understanding Digital Photography" by Bryon Peterson is a bit like being at a family get-together, and being given a lot of good advice by friendly Uncle Phil over a couple of beers. Then you later discover that friendly Uncle Phil didn't know what he was talking about! It does mar what was otherwise a good experience.  What makes me think of a family get-together is the folksy, jocular tone and the amusing comparisons between technical subjects and familiar things. Here are a few of Bryan Peterson's more colorful attempts at making digital photography understandable:  - The pixels on the sensor work together like a family, like socialism, and it's too bad Stalin and Mao Tse-tung couldn't see this (pg 16).  - JPEGs are like amnesia or like AM radio or like prepared meat loaf (pg 18, 20).  - TIFFs are like elephants (pg 19).  - ISO is like caffeine, and high ISO is like bloodshot eyes (pg 22).  - Long exposure times cause the pixel family to fall apart and have a nervous breakdown (pg 78).  - Checking the background is important, although typically not done regarding the person you're going to marry (pg 96).  - Over-sharpening a picture makes it glow, which could be used to guide Santa Claus and Rudolph (pg 129).  This style of writing may appeal to some people, but it's definitely not my cup of tea.  The book is richly illustrated with a lot of photographs taken by Bryan Peterson. These pictures do a good job of presenting the various techniques being discussed, and they are all good pictures from a purely technical point of view.  However, my aesthetic opinion of most of the pictures is fairly low, i.e., they are not the kind of pictures that I'd like to be able to make someday.  Bryan Peterson favors very colorful photos, and he admits that he pushes the color saturation up on most of his pictures. The composition and subjects of many of his pictures leave a kind of artificial taste, as if the pictures were being made just for the sake of making pictures that will impress.  Of course, taste is something that is very individual, and Bryan Peterson is a successful professional photographer so there are obviously many people who like his pictures.  The most serious problem with this book is the large number of technical errors concerning digital photography. Here are some of the more serious examples:  - "... the more pixels the merrier" (pg 16). Only true up to a point.  - "Every time you open and close a JPEG file on your computer, the file degrades due to data being lost..." (pg 18). Not true, and Bryan Peterson's warnings against using JPEGs are mostly incorrect.  - White balance should always be set to "Cloudy+3" (pg 26). Poor advice, especially when photographing people because of the need to get skin colors correct.  - Landscapes should be shot at f/22 (pg 34) and macros at f/32 (pg 118). This doesn't take the light diffraction problem into account.  - Depth of field properties of a lens are independent of sensor size (pg 39 and 119). Not true.  - Noise reduction should be done last in post processing (pg 57). No, it should be done first.  - Clean the sensor with compressed air (pg 127). No, this can damage the camera.  - Take pictures under-exposed by 3 stops in order to stack 8 of them in Photoshop (pg 148). Crazy advice, you should change the opacity of the layers instead.  - "The output size of that file ... will be around 2048 x 3000 ppi (pixels per inch) ..." (pg 156). Meaningless statement.  Bryan Peterson tells us that he shot film for many years and only recently switched to digital. This book was obviously written before he had learned enough about digital photography to explain it properly.  So, I don't like the tone of the writing and I don't particularly like the pictures and I don't think Bryan Peterson's knowledge of digital photography was up to the task. What did I like about this book?  Actually, the basic concepts regarding photography that Bryan Peterson describes are good. The importance of getting the picture right when shooting it (as opposed to Photoshopping it later), the way in which aperture and shutter speed affect the picture, the importance of how a picture is illuminated and composed, the value of using a tripod; all of this material represents the core concepts of photography that need to be learned in order to be able to consistently take good pictures.  Another thing I appreciated was that Bryan Peterson says that understanding the technology isn't the most important aspect of being a good photographer. "... 99% of all successful photographic images have relied on ... setting a creatively correct exposure and ... creating a well-balanced and compelling composition" (pg 10). This book is inadvertent proof that a lack of technical knowledge does not prevent a person with the proper basic knowledge of photography from taking good pictures.  Still, for a book that is targeted at those who want to learn about digital photography, the many errors disqualify it.  Rennie Peterse 
 Just like one of the other reviewers, I've probably read a good 20 Laymon books. And even though a few like Blood Games and Among the Missing seemed relatively pointless and more then a little boring most of the time, I made it to the end of their 350-450 pages. With this piece of junk however, I struggled until pg. 60 and then gave up. It seems the author was on a real woman hating jig for this one. Whereas most of this female characters are at least equal to their male counterparts, if not downright surpassing them in cleverness, as in One Rainy Night, the protagonist of Come Out Tonight is so pathetically stupid that I went from wishing bad things upon her to straight not caring enough about her to finish the book. The "Villain" is just some moronic nerd with a god complex and way to many issues, that we are subjected to over and over. If your looking for a good Laymon book, there are plenty. I personally recommend The Traveling Vampire Show, Body Rides, the Island, and Darkness, Tell Us. While all these titles, especially the Island contain perversion and stomach turning scenes, the characters found within them are in most cases realistic, easily empathized with, or downright loved. Check some of those out, or some of his earlier work, (Midnights Lair was wicked fun,) just avoid this piece of junk at all costs. You've been warned. 
 This movie was not Bill Murray's  best. I would not recommend it to anyone 
 This books contains just about everything you will need to FULLY understand the implentation of tcp/ip on a unix based computer.  But if you are like the 95% of people in the computer world, you are running windows, and this book contains nothing regarding its implementation on a windows system 
 This book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the Dot Com Boom was at its zenith, shortly before the crash. Interestingly, there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon.  Lewis' "Liar's Poker" was extremely enjoyable, particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players. In this book, Lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character. The tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to Clark's disciples as the "smartest," "best," "greatest," and "most ingenious," individuals in their various fields.  What strains credibility, however, is the attribution of all Clark's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight, while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and short-sighted beliefs of others. History will probably not judge Clark as charitably as Lewis -- especially since most of the Clark's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their Dot Com era glory (most notably SGI, Netscape, and Healtheon).  Throughout the book, Jim Clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between $3 and $4 billion. The list of 2004 Forbes 400 Richest in America shows Jim Clark with an approximated net worth of $700 million. For a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of Oracle's Larry Ellison, today Clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation: billionaire.  
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 I picked this up at my Babies R Us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror, I would be able to keep an eye on her. From the minute I brought it home, it smelled awful, like artificial grapes. I have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks.  At this point I am just going to throw it out because I can't imagine having that smell in my car! (I have since been back to Babies R Us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad, and they do.) Don't buy it without smelling it 
 No, you didn't. You read about 300 pages of gossip, slander and supposition. The font size is so big, when I first opened this book, I thought I had bought the "large print" version by mistake.  Yes, as many have noted, this book seems to "read fast" for a history book. But the number of words per page can also be used to guage the research and thought that Fleming put into his attack on "the New Dealers."  Any potential buyer might be advised to use the "look inside" feature to compare a page of this book with, for example, an excerpt from Robert Dallek's "Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy" or James MacGregor Burns' "Roosevelt: Soldier of Freedom." Eric Larabee's "Commander in Chief" is even more packed with information 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 Disney is a joke and this movie is a joke.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  Why does Disney keep instisting on taking these dark, disturbing tales, such as Pocahontas, Alladin and the Huntchback of Notre Dame (which, by the way is really Notre Dame of Paris) and making them into cutsey kids films?  And, oh, lets give it a happy wappy, cutesy wutesy ending.  Screw that; this is a dark, sad and disturbing tale AND THAT'S THE WAY THIS STORY SHOULD BE!  What the heck story is Disney going to try to adapt as a children's film next?  The Scarlet Letter?  
 True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion.  First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge.  They have become parodies of themselves.  In another review I saw the phrase, "overly mannered," which I feel hits home.  The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed.  Since when did gunslingers become such wimps?  Since part 5 & 6.  That's when.  The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets.  The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times.  As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour.             
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 As a psychiatrist and person with mentally ill family members, I can only bemoan all of the misinformation contained in this book. The truth is that many of the mentally ill in America do not get the treatment they need precisely because they believe the things said in this book, on tv, etc. As someone who has lived outside of the US and in the developing world, I can tell you that their mental health treatment pales compared to what is available in the United States and is much more primitive and coercive. Although it is true that many psychiatric medications have serious side effects, the consequences of living with symptoms of a serious mental illness can only convince you of how devastating that can be to both the ill person and his or her family. Furthermore, as someone who is also experienced in administering ECT, I can personally attest to the wonderful success rate of this treatment for persons with severe depression who have failed all alternatives and who would rather be dead than live out their lives. (And many, unfortunately, do decide on death as a last resort).  As far as lobotomies, ice baths, and forced stays in hospitals or other facilities, these are things of the past in the United States. In fact, one of the biggest problems I face in my practice is the extreme difficulty I have in placing someone in the hospital when they actually need a brief stay (typical stays are 5-7 days) because of a lack of psychiatric beds ( more than 90% of psychiatric beds were eliminated from American hospitals in the last 15 years as a cost-cutting measure). The other problems faced by modern psychiatry still includes stigmatisation of the mentally ill and then all the more mundane issues such as needs for help with housing, employment, and job development. But I bet you wouldn't find the author writing a book about that 
 In the year 2006 and onward, music like this is DEAD. In other words, few people in the new generation are gonna like this stuff and I'm proof of this: one star. They're completely bland in style and I can't believe that one reviewer bought this CD just for the Beatles remake; that was easily the worst song on there. They slayed it! If you want the kings of this genre, check out Parliament/Funkadelic, but really I'm not an ecstatic fan of anyone in this genre. 
 I have used this commentary in my personal study of the book of Acts. Though Bruce is a good scholar, he does not do a good job here. He avoids the crucial issues that automatically sufaces when one reads the text.  Often he just restates what the text has already said. I suppose this shows  the difficulty of writing a commentary on a historical book, compared to a  "teaching" book.  Put your money on Marshalls Tyndale commentary  instead. He has a remarkable ability to forecast which questions the reader  will have 
 "American Buffalo" was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic.  It is indeed raw, but not at all fantastic.  The dialogue is very choppy and I felt out of the loop with it - as if I missed some great detail.  Perhaps this is a play that needs to be enjoyed when seen performed, rather than just read. I do not recommend 
 Had I read this when I was taking journalism classes in secondary school, I probably would've pursued that career instead of what I chose.  (Probably a good thing I didn't, since I wouldn't want to be part of the mainstream media today...)  It's incredible to see what one man was able to do, and be involved with, in his life.  However, as interesting as some of his life stories are, this rambling book makes you work to figure them out.  It wanders back and forth through the decades in a frustrating manner.  There are some interesting anecdotes, to be sure, but the book could use some thorough editing 
 I wanted to love Jamaica Kincaid -- I really did. I first picked up Lucy expecting to love it because I had heard such wonderful things about Kincaid.  What a pathetic disappointment.  The novel drones on with no purpose and little plot. The writing is on the level of a pre-teen novel. In fact, had I read this when I was 13, it would have been incredible. Unfortunately, I'm not 13 anymore.  The overarching flaw in Lucy is that the reader has absolutely no reason to care about the title character. She hates her new home -- for no reason. She hates her old home -- for no reason. She hates everyone she meets -- for no reason.  At least once in every section she mentions how she either hates something or how something doesn't meet her approval -- however, we are never given a reason for her disdain or her high standards. In fact, we are given the opposite -- we are continually reminded of how ignorant Lucy is by her incessant complaining and idiotic comments.  The character is supposed to be powerful and honest and courageous. In reality she is self-absorbed, ignorant, and dull.  I really did want to like this book. Unfortunately, it's the kind of novel that will be praised by people who don't know any better -- who praise books simply because Oprah liked them.  If you've got nothing better to read when you go to the beach one day, it's fine -- just don't expect to be impressed or empowered by it. It's nothing more than a dimestore rag 
 Silone's communist message is outdated. More, he makes the cardinal error to believe that solidarity is a basic human characteristic: 'Bread is made of many grains of corn, wine is made of many grapes, so it means unity. Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.' But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival.  His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land. 'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character. He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'. In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers. The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore.  Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles? His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'.  Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears.  What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war. It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic.  I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit' 
 WASTE OF MY MONEY. PEOPLE OVER RATE PAC AFTER HE DIED, THAT'S WHY B.I.G. SAID IT BEST, "YOU'RE NOBODY TILL SOMEBODY KILLS YOU." THE ALBUM DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY DIRECTION. NOTHING LYRICAL OR POETIC ABOUT THIS TRASH! NURSERY RHYMES AND TRASH TALK IS WHAT MOST OF THIS ALBUM HAS 
      Three kids whose parents have abandoned them are put at a place called Whitegates.  They escape and go down river to the worst place you could ever imagine.  This is where they meet the grateful Heaven Eye's.  They also met heaven Eye's grandpa who is a little weird and scary. The scariest things happen in the Black Middens.  They have to try and find out the mystery of the Black Middens, Heaven Eye's, and grandpa      The dislikes I had about the book was every time someone had said something David would write he said, she said.  He would never replace said with yelled or screamed or anything.  I didn't really like the end of the book that much.  I thought the book was a little pointless.  The ending didn't really have a reason behind it.      I would recommend this book to people who are into books about people getting stuck somewhere.  Also I would recommend this book to people who look at the positives in life.  
 I just wanted to write a little note about getting the case open.  I just received my copy today, and in my excitement discarded the darn instruction on how to open......I know you're all probably thinking I'm just stupid.....after realizing what I did - I'd have to agree!  :)  Anyway, if you pull off the "peel" tab and get rid of it - here's what you do:    See that red tab at the top of the box/package?  Hold the case from the "spine" and pull the little red tab down.  I found it most effective if I used my thumb and index finger (I'm right handed) on the tab and placed my middle finger on the top of the spine, and pushed a little with my middle finger.  I've gotten so used to ink cartridges, and other items that have a "don't pull this yet" type of tab, I was a little afraid of touching it....until of course I finally found what I did with my "peel" notice and found I did need to pull on the little red tab.    So that's all there is to it.  Again, most of you out there probably think I'm stupid - but for the one or two others out there that tossed that peel tab  - Enjoy.  I'm going to install tomorrow, and once I've used the programs I'll see about a real review then 
 The first time I wrote a review for this book, I gave it 5 stars.However, this book is the least accurate of all the Lucy book I have read, and I have read a lot.  While I was reading it, I noticed that some of the things Mr. Brochu said about Lucy directly contradicted with her autobiography. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then I went to Luie Arnaz's website. She distinctly said that this book was not accurate at all and to skip it.Then everything started to fall into place. This is as much of a cartoon of Lucy's life as anything. Yes, it's touching, but what good is touching if it's not true? Everytime I think about the fact that Mr. Brochu so plainly lied, it infuriates me to tears. If you want to know the REAL Lucy, skip this book. Go staright to her own touching, candid memoirs, "Love, Lucy.&quot 
 Hiya! this book is a waste of money and space. what kind of an idiot would carry this book around? when all the information is in the linux system itself?? MAN pages and INFO pages.  observe. you can search for utilities in the Linux system by using APROPOS. can you automatically search for the utility you want in this thick thick book? lets say i want to use an editor. all you do from the command line is...  x@y:/$ apropos editor  the linux system automatically searches the database and man pages for the keyword "editor" and you get a whole list of editors you can choose from. try that with this book, all the utilities in this book are listed alphebetically... very good filtering / indexing system indeed *sarcasm*   you have to have pretty good knowledge and know the command and what you're looking for from the beginning to find this book useful. the irony of this is that once your knowledge level is at that level all you really need are the MAN pages.  
 This book is three times longer than needed! Feels as though Penman could not decide whom she wanted to be the central character.   This book is not worth the effort to read. By story's end the characters are exhausted and so is the reader 
 Would that the producers would have spent their time and energy on season SIX, SEVEN, and EIGHT of this truly great Britcom series than to waste their time producing this overview of past glories.  AS TIME GOES BY is by my way of thinking the BEST of all the Britcoms that have come across the pond.  GIVE US THE REMAINING SEASONS rather that this "Best of . . ." abbreviation.  It may be a good introduction for those who have not seen the series on TV but your money is better spent on buying one of the seasons already available on DVD or catching whatever you local PBS station may be using as a filler in its broadcasting schedule.  Go for the full blown series, you won't be disappointed 
 This is a stupid book.  I got about half way through and stopped reading.  Blech.  Stilted language and not one character to root for.  The main character (Jane McGuire) is petulant, rude and for all her "worldliness" is very childish.  She seems to be constantly stamping her beautiful little foot and uttering "Damn you!!!"  She insists on doing as she pleases and all the responsible adults around her roll over, declare that she knows best, and allow her to do it.  And she is such an irresistible "woman" that 34 year old Mark Trevor salivates over her (this part is just weird) as do almost all of the other male characters.  And she is portrayed to be so much older than 20 year old Jock and 23 or so Mario.  Puh-lease.  Oh, yeah.  Ya gotta love how the ridiculous plot includes ancient treasure, international terrorism, and numerous references to 9/11 and Homeland Security.  Ooohh.  This is my first IJ book and surely my last.  I got to page 250 before bailing on it.  What was the publisher thinking 
 I was disappointed, after reading several reviews that implied this is a scary movie that has been overlooked by the general public.  I'm a fan of made for tv 70's scary movies, and love movies that have things that go bump in the night, or hauntings, or scary old houses.  This movie was basically more psychological, and not scary at all.  The so-called surprise ending was not developed enough to make sense.  The directing was  poor, and all in all, I'm so frustrated that I spent money on this film.  It's priced at only 4.99 now, so that may be worth it, if the shipping is free.  It's cheaper than renting it, but you'll probobly never want to watch it again, so why own it 
 Man, have I given this guy a chance.  Multiple chances.  Listened to the CDs, saw the big HBO special.  I mean, his career is red hot now.  He clearly has lots of fans.  Mostly college age (perhaps this should be a warning to some of you).  All I can say is "maybe they'll grow out of it."  He is NOT funny.  His act has no bite, no point of view, no opinion/viewpoint at all.  His comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to (the "this is all happened to us" or "has this ever happened to you?" school of humor).  He runs about manically, acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth (for those in the audience that may not be so good with words).  His fans acknowledge that, yes, they can relate.  "Yeah!  That's happened to me!"  "I know that reference!'  They laugh, cheer, clap, and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit.  He never actually COMMENTS on the things he discusses in any intelligent, interesting way.  He has no edge.  He's not outraged by anything.  He's cute 'n' cuddly.  Richard Pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that Cook is classified as a stand up comic.  "Pryor?  The guy writing this must be OLD!'  Okay, try this on for size:  Chris Rock is good comedy.  Same with Dave Chappelle.  Carlin.  Laura Kightlinger.  Kinison.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Bob Saget.  Gilbert Gottfried.  Dom Irrera.  Lewis Black.  Robert Klein.  The late Mitch Hedberg.  Jim Norton.  Patton Oswalt.  Brian Posehn.  DeGeneres.  Jon Stewart.  Bob & David.  The UCB.  I'm not even a big fan of Sarah Silverman, but at least she's trying to bring something different to the party.  Anything but this!  God help us.  Let's hope he goes the way of Carrot Top and Dice soon (don't forget, Cook fans, Mr. Top and Mr. Clay were once as popular as your boy here) 
 This book might be helpful as a starting point for someone who knows nothing about lymphedema. It read like a tired retread of the information the American Cancer Society dispenses for free. Since I experience a direct  correlation between protein intake and arm swelling, I was hoping the  authors would go into far greater diet detail than their short chapter on  nutritional supplements. Save your money -- there is nothing new here 
 This is a poorly edited book marred by repetitive treatment of topics.  It is also weak on the description of how conclusions, often startling and counterintuitive, were reached by scientists 
 The animation was cool, but the storyline lacked a whole lot of substance. This movie needs a lot more background information for it to be interesting. Also, remember the speeder chase through the forest in Star  Wars: Return of the Jedi? Well, expect to hear those very sound bytes for  the alien fighters in this movie.. 
 I was looking for more information in reference to alzheimer's disease itself, which I was very disappointed to find.  They were very private when Mr. Reagan was going through the ordeal with the public and apparently want to keep it that way.  My own mother died of alzheimer's this past year, but I could not relate to much of anything in this book, since not much information was given about the disease.  I was surprised on how close she spoke of how her mother and her had gotten, yet she stayed in hotels when she went to visit her mother. The book was took place during the very beginning of alzheimer's....then a lapse for several years until the end - no meat at all!  It seemed like it was more about Patti's guilt over years of not getting along with her parents, more than anything else.  On a more positive side, Patti's writing itself is outstanding, including her descriptions and flow.  The title of the book is very true when it comes to alzheimer's, however, the details of the book was ALL ABOUT PATTI, and should be renamed just that.  
 I ordered on 10/4/2005. As of March 27th, I still haven't received the first issue, I don't even want it now! How do I get credit for the payment made back in October 
 I liked this book very much when I started reading it.  The authors' characterizations of sailing were right on the money.  The characters and plot start out interesting but it seems the book was rushed to a sloppy and confusing ending that left me dissatisfied and wanting more.  I kept waiting for somthing to tie things together, but it never happened 
 This is a great concept: illustrate principles of physics using art and nature.  Unfortunately, the execution is poor.  The book's layout is dull, and the whole thing comes across as boring rather than fascinating.  I had hoped to share it with someone who doesn't like science, but couldn't, because it would have turned him off even more.  A great disappointment 
 This book is just plain hateful, mean and nasty. The humor is of South Park IQ level. If you laugh at talking poop, you will probably think this is funny.  I'm keeping the book because I enjoy the pictures (that is, the ones that are reasonably well reproduced). Were the 70's tacky? Yes. Were they fun? YES. Lighten up Lileks. It's ok to have fun. What is your decor? Victorian? Now that's laughable! 
 Peter Fonda and Kurt Russell surfing a wave down a Los Angeles reservoir is not cool, does not make this movie worth a look, good God, that scene stinks. P-U. Campy. This movie is a mess. A horribly made sequel. So bad it actually tarnishes the reputation of the original 
 Whitney Houston is a nice-looking woman, has a beautiful voice, a good selection of songs... Why her producers have issued this crappy edition of her "Greatest" Hits???...  The first disc is OK, almost all of her best romantic hits ("Didn't We Almost Have It All" and "Saving All My Love For You" plus the main theme for "The Bodyguard" originally from Dolly Parton) are included. The second disc however, is purely another attempt to promote these modern (and weird) DJs that "mix" dancing themes, whose original versions are far better than the mixed versions!  
 I don't know if we are just a strange a-typical family, but this whole daddy and me book was based on things that only mommy can do in our house- daddy doesn't even have any tools. I love Karen Katz books, but this story simply made us cringe. If you are a father who has a son and like to do stuff with you tools in the garage, then this book is for you 
 This book isnt worth the money you pay for it. It's only the ladys negative opinions on EVERYTHING without any facts or real information. 
 Although Widdowson is the editor of the Oxford Introductions to Language Studies series this book does not have the same feel as others in the series. The format is the same with a selection of readings following the author's introduction. However, this book seems to have been written as an introduction for experienced linguists. It contains all of the information but with none of the details that would make it a pleasant read for novices. Ultimately, trying to squeeze everything there is to be said about linguistics into 77 pages is an impossible task and makes for an unprofitable read.  That said, the selection of readings is particularly strong and Widdowson asks some pointed questions of each author. It is at times very apparent what answer he expects because he goes on to ask questions based on what his answer would be. This would annoy those who disagree with him.  This book only rated two stars because I expected more from the series editor. Widdowson seems to have missed the second word of the series title: introductions. Only those with a graduate level reading ability in the field of linguistics would find this book enjoyable. I would recommend Jean Aitchison's book instead (0340870834). It is highly readable and geared more for the novice 
 This is one of the worst attempts ever seen at being an authoritative sourcebook.  The author references himself, often in this very same book, numerous times throughout.  Nothing new here as every entry is culled from other, better sources, and many of the excerpts are shallow at best.  Overall writing style is poor.  Do yourself a favor and pass this one up.  If you recently bought it, return the thing and save some money with which you can buy some decent books on lycanthropy.  Whatever you do, do not take Brad Steiger's words seriously.  Of course, it *could* be good for a laugh or two, but what little bit of rubbish isn't 
 Great idea poorly executed with an extremely unappetizing presentation. This is from someone who makes flavored rice a few times a week. That being said, this is the worst review I have ever given anywhere, so bear with me.  You know how sometimes the rice sticks to the bottom of the pan if you overcook and you have to boil it out and it turns oddly clear but covered in carbon water? Yeah. Like that. The rice came out sticky (not it the palatable uniform Japanese steamed rice way) and was an almost alien kind of translucent brown that was nothing like the picture. Nothing. If you look closely, you might be able to tell it had once been rice.  Yes, I followed the instructions.   My husband, who wanted to try having fresh rice at work, described it as an abomination, which was a relief to me because when it was cooking it stenched up the house with a horrifying yet familiar odor that when I put my finger on it smelled exactly, EXACTLY, like Onondaga Lake in Syracuse NY is the summer back when it was the most polluted lake in the world and people were warned never to eat the fish they caught (assuming there were any alive in there) and kids weren't allowed to wade in it. It smells like raw sewage, dead fish, rotting feathers and chicken soup.  It was 45F out and I opened the window.  Sometimes you buy a case of something and it turns out to be something you don't care for, maybe it has too much onion or whatever, but you know someone else will like it. Normally I donate these things to a needy family. I think in this case it would be cruel. I can't imagine anyone who has made rice on their own mistaking this for rice. Do yourself a favor and just drop a boullion cube in a pot with your stovetop rice. That's what they're trying to do here and failing at miserably.  I can't sell the rest on an auction site because I'm afraid that even if I am completely honest about the smell I will get a bad rating. The only thing I can think of to use them for is to smoke out people in the breakroom with the odor next April Fool's Day 
 I found this book to be rather scatter-shod and unfocused. Being an experienced user of Cinema 4D I was honestly looking forward to the release of this book. Given its title that suggests the book will cover animating with Cinema 4D in-depth, I was rather shocked to find it covered the integration of 3rd party apps more then it covered Cinema 4D. Leaving out coverage of the Timeline and F-Curves in Cinema 4D, this book barely scrapes the surface of Cinema 4D. In fact, more than anything it seems to suggest that you can't accomplish a whole lot in Cinema 4D without 3rd party apps. Which any experienced Cinema 4D user will tell you is far from the truth. I would suggest skipping this book altogether 
 Written in 1984, and supposedly "updated" in 2005, I can sum up this book quickly for you:  1. Avoid being your true self (after all, men do not want to marry the real you).  2. Endlessly cater to his ego.  3. Act like it's 1950.  If you follow these simple steps, you'll be sure to land a husband, but he's most likely a jerk, and then you're stuck in a miserable marriage.  Good Luck!  Frankly, I cannot believe this stuff went over in 1984.  Another reviewer called this demeaning to men, but if you read this book, you will not believe how it demeans women.    Maybe, if you're a gold digger, this is a good book for you!  Perhaps it was a bestseller in 1984, since there were so many wealthy bachelors seeking a trophy wife.  Look how that turned out: cocaine-addicted, miserable wives who starved and hated themselves because their husbands were never home, they were instead with their mistresses or on the golf course.  If that's what you seek, read the book 
 This book may be good for some, however it is misleading in the description. I was led to beleive that this book was in fact comic book coversations to help explain simple situations to my child with Autism. Instead, you have to write your own comic strips to do the explaining. Not worth the book in my opinion if it is still up to me to do all the work, I already do that without this book 
 Of all the books written on the Reagan administration, this one may be one of the worst.  Poorly written with excessive attention to detail that makes the story plod, it makes one wonder if Frances Fitzgerald was a one hit wonder.   Fitzgerald's portrayal of Reagan as out of step with reality - starting with the book title and included throughout its content - is less of a description of reality and more, I suspect, the blowing off of ideological steam.  If you despise Reagan and think he was a dunderhead this book will do more than reinforce those beliefs.  If you want an intelligent and useful discussion of the Reagan Administration and its foreign policy walk right past this one 
 It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box.  The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would  get 'trapped' inside the unit.  And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether.  Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should.  If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully;  a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one.  Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances.  
 Awful game. Nothing like the show. The only way we could try to make it work was to have both teams answer each round and just see who scored the most points. They must pay people to write some of those 5 star reviews. I doubt my family will ever play this game again. Boring 
 This novella is the weakest of Mark Harris's Henry Wiggens books. It is to be read by those who have to read everything in the series but compared to The Southpaw and Bang the Drum Slowly it comes up short. Weak in plot and in inventivness but strong in sugar 
 I have to say I am rather disappointed with this item. Considering its price, I was expecting a firm control garment. It's not that it isn't well constructed and it is very comfortable, but it isn't anything approaching what I would call 'firm-control'. I don't think it would qualify for the title 'moderate-control'either. Much too expensive for what is essentially a light control briefer 
 I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc.  That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO?  Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
  Wealthy socialite and, as we later learn, brilliant surgeon Dr. Royce Lee (Elissa Landi) schleps 10,000 miles to the Philippines to rendezvous with, and marry, Dr. Jan Stockman (Otto Krueger), a pleasant (albeit a tad absent minded and disorganized) jungle doctor.  Ominously, CORREGIDOR, a movie named for an island that was the site of a crushing Allied defeat at the hands of the Japanese in 1942, begins its existence as a Somerset Maugham-ish White-Tie Love in the Mango Fields type love story.  Anyway, even though Dr. Royce sent an explanatory letter four months ago, the news of the wedding still comes as a bit of a (not disagreeable) shock to Dr. Jan.     No sooner are the nuptials joined then a squadron of Japanese planes darken the air and proceed to make hash out of the doctors' jungle home, wiping out the wedding guests in the process.  It's at this point that CORREGIDOR makes it first uneasy transition into action movie mode.  The courageous newlyweds begin the six-hundred mile trek to Manila, hiking through jungle sets and bushy back lots, avoiding the Enemy as best they can, until finally stumbling upon a small unit of American infantrymen.  A half-dozen or so Enemy enter stage right, half-heartedly fire at the Heroes.  The Heroes fire back and saunter off, if that's not too energetic a word for it, and somehow lose their pursuers.  The movie will go on to squander the rest of its miserable existence alternating melodramatic and overly complicated romantic subplots (there's a Dr. Michael at Corregidor...) with static and awkwardly staged action sequences.  About the only consistent quality in this movie is its lack of continuity.   One saving grace of CORREGIDOR is its willingness, verging on mania, to kill off most of its annoying secondary players.  Unfortunately, it kills off one at the end of act two only to have Dr. Royce hand a baby off to her in the middle of act three.  Not to be outdone by its melodramatic half, the action sequences also shown a strong aversion to keeping things straight.  An Enemy monoplane fighter is fatally shot but it's a biplane that plummets to earth.  To be fair, the movie was released in spring of 1943, about nine months after the real article surrendered.  That's a short incubation period for a movie, which may explain, if not excuse, some of its more glaring flaws.  This is a pep rally movie, and it gave the viewing public a chance to see one rousing infantry charge (complete with Battle Hymn of the Republic underscoring), the Enemy in disreputable retreat, and a stern scene of American defiance in defeat.     Still, CORREGIDOR is a bad movie, and whatever emotional charge it once carried dissipated long ago.  The actors are much better than the material, especially Otto Krueger.  I don't recall seeing him in anything else, but he combines the unpretentious amiability of a Jimmy Stewart with the melancholy detachment of a Leslie Howard.  Krueger doesn't have their charisma or star power, but his good performance is wasted in this one.   Fans of war movies may find CORREGIDOR moderately interesting.    
 NO MOVING PARTS contrary to depiction above. The "attachments" are tiny plastic 1.5" knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet! They do not move. There is no massaging action - YOU DO ALL THE WORK, making your hips and knees sore. The "massaging foot beds" are totally motionless and form a spiky, painful surface. Vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device. Jets are totally underpowered. No fill line indicator so "Bubbles" spill water onto floor. Heater is completely useless - after 15 minutes water temp was no different. Cannot return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads. Classic deception in advertising 
 The only thing I can give this author credit for is the idea. The rest of it just made me want to laugh! Everything was so horrifyingly predictable - at first I wondered if it was supposed to be a satire on the quintessential "happy ending" novel of the time, but its countless sex scenes forced me to scrap that idea. Not to mention the endless (and I mean endless) coincidences and silly actions by silly characters that I just can't be forced to believe.  And honestly, I could not bring myself to like the protagonist. Her "modern" outlook on life seems, to put it plainly, like that of a modern hooker. She does stupid things and never learns from them - insisting that she won't be "put down" by an era wherein it's merely common sense not to do certain things.  All in all, the author had a good idea, but her writing was too silly to make it worth reading. At least it gave me a good laugh 
 Ms. Fleming is enjoying superstar status at the moment, so it is no surprise that she ventures into unchartered territory for her audience, even if it is not new to herself.   She sings the material with a dusky, smoky quality in her voice and with her usual technical competence.  However, this recording is so overdone and over-performed that the beautiful numbers she has chosen are blown completely out of shape (with the exception of "My Cherie Amor") by a monotonous overuse of the techique of backsinging.  I was irritated by needing to look to the accompaniment for some kind of footing in her endlessly swimming interpretations, breaking the logic of the music and distroying any continuity in my concentration.   I find the CD monotonous and boring.  Ms. Fleming chose to make this offering more about herself rather than the music.  Simple and sultry would have been much more effective than these unnecessarily complicated renditions.  This is not great singing and is just another disappointing venture by an opera singer in the popular/jazz/blues genre.  I wish I could get my money back.         
 This book seems an extension, and maybe an infringment, of the title Betrayal In Vietnam written by Louis Fanning 
 I strongly disagree with the other reviews.  While the DVD is a good documentary of Louis Armstrong's life, it only has "imbedded" songs, and the menus (indexes) are not set up to go to the songs, so you have to search for them.  Unless you enjoy watching the documentary over and over, this is not way to enjoy his music.   I wish I could view the songs without having to shift though a bunch of commentary.   I wanted to watch him perform "What a Wonderful World", but it only had about a thirty second clip of that song, and there was no views of Satchmo performing that song . . . it only had a video of people showing their respect at Satchmo funeral.   There really was only a couple songs showing Satchmo singing the entire song.  Really disappointing throughtout. 
 I bought this book at a time when I was looking for source materials on native american culture and living for the non native american person. The book came reccomended to me by a friend who owned it with a word of caution that it was just alright. I went out and bought it, read through it and found it ok in some places and questionable in others. The author does advertise her other "for sale" services quite a bit which gets a little daunting, however there are some chapters which are well written and full of imagery. The two I liked best were her chapter on crystals where she describes a gift giving ceremony between her and friends, something which I have enjoyed doing myself. I also liked the part onbuilding your own personal altar, unlike other new age authors who proclaim altar set ups and endless tools, the author of this book tells readers to have an empty altar, perhaps covered in a sacred cloth which can be a simple focal point rather than a holder of all sorts of tools. All in all If you want this book then buy it used, use those parts of it that speak to you and discard the rest. Incidently, there is a picture of the author in the back of the book and looking at her I couldnt help but feel a bit uneasy, she dosent present a very spiritual image 
 I purchased this book through amazon and it had 4 pages missing unfortunately.  The person who sold it took probably the best pages and sold the rest 
 I was excited about being able to afford a color laser jet printer...until the HP 2650 printed a grand total of 6 pages and then died (a "fuser" problem).  This is the second HP printer that has died a premature death on me in 14 months - the other a B&W laserjet. Working with HP is a real nightmare. When I called I was put on hold for 15 minutes each with a series of customer service reps who could not help me. Finally they said they would ship out a replacement unit within 2 days. 10 days later no printer and I called to see what had happened (they did not ship because they had written down a wrong PHONE number for me!) They said the unit would be shipped out ASAP. It did not arrive until nearly another 10 days had passed. By then I had  to buy another printer and just refused delivery on the HP. I would never buy another.  My Apple laser printer lasted 8 YEARS with no problems.. 
 In WPF, Plantinga tries to provide an account of warrant that is superior to rivals such as Goldman's process reliabilism.  The work suffers from the following defects.  First, he is too quick in dismissing rival accounts.  Second, his arguments against evolutionary-naturalism will only convince those who already think that evolutionary naturalism is false.  Third, while he is quick to dismiss rival views, his own positive answers to philosophical problems are entirely unsatisfactory.  Consider his 'solution' to the Benacerraf problem.  It seems that mathematical statements refer to abstract objects.  It also seems that there must be a causal connection between our belief forming processes and the objects of belief if those beliefs are to be thought of as viable candidates for knowledge.  Plantinga says that this is not a problem for the theist who is willing to say that mathematical principles are structures of the divine mind since surely the connection between God and God's subjects is not problematic.  How one could think that Benacerraf's problem is a genuine one and that this is an adequate solution is beyond me.  While his WCD is to be recommended to those wanting an introduction to epistemology, this book is of limited merit 
 Having enjoyed other Ripley stories, I found all the cental characters in the book unlikeley, and discriptions of Ripley and his relationships irritating and was glad to finish the book, by skimming the pages towards the finish.  
 Gays have been remarkably successful and promoting their social agenda not just in the US, but throughout the industialized world.  The last great obstacle they face is overcoming religious prejudice against their practices, so it is not surprising that when confronted with scripture that unequivocally condemns same-sex sexuality, they put themselves through all manner of logical and interpetive contortions to show that the Bible doesn't really mean what it says quite clearly.  There is little point in going through the book argument by argument and offering a rebuttal.  And I will say right off that in a way I agree at least partially with the author, when he says, for instance, that we should try to understand biblical teaching within context--historical/cultural analysis is a valid method of scriptural analysis.    But the author claims, outrageously, that we modern-day Christians are interpreting biblical prohibitions against homosexuality  from a position of our own cultural bias. Nothing could be further from the truth.  That people during biblical times didn't recognize homosexuality as a "condition" (for lack of a better word) isn't particularly relevant, since they weren't codemning BEING homosexual, but ENGAGING in homosexual sex.  And this is pretty much the Catholic church's position today.  It is not a sin to BE homosexual.  It is a sin, though--borne of a "grave disorder" over which the person may very well have no control--to engage in same-sex sexual activity...just as it is a sin to engage in pre-marital sex, adultery, and so on.  It is a given, speaking from a Christian perspective, that people are borne imperfect and subject to all manner of temptations toward bad behavior.  How we act on those temptations is entirely up to us, though.  That we experience impure impulses is not proof that God wants us to indulge those impulses.  Which leads to an important part of Helminiak's argument.  He offers this:  1. Some people are born homosexual. It is a condition over which they have no control, like skin color, and height.  2.  According to scripture, God creates us.  Therefore, God creates homosexuals.  3. If we regard homosexuals as flawed, then we must assume God created them flawed deliberately.  4.  This would make God evil.  5.  God cannot be evil.  6.  Therefore, homosexuals must not be flawed.  7. If God did not create them flawed, he created them correctly.  8. God would not condemn what he created correctly.  9. Since God created homosexuals correctly, and does not, therefore, condemn them, it is wrong for us to condemn homosexual acts.  Sounds reasonable, right?  It's not, though.  First, #1 is never proved.  You can't assume a major premise unless for all practical purposes it is recognized as factual.  It must be widely accepted, or arrived at inductively in the argument.  The author provides no evidence to establish his major premise, that homosexuality is an inherent and immutable trait like skin color; he merely offers it as fact. It isn't a fact.  And there is plenty of reason to doubt his premise.  Once the major premise as been destroyed, the whole argument becomes moot, invalid.  But let's continue anyway....  He goes on to assert that God created homosexuals, and would not create people he knew he would condemn.  The idea of predestination varies among denominations, so I don't even want to go there.  What all denominations agree on, though, is that we live in a fallen world, and that all people are prone to sin.  It is as easy to say that God creates the pedophile, the dog-raper, the serial killer, and that we are foolish for considering these people flawed, because God created them.  Clearly, though, we are not wrong to consider these people flawed.  And just as clearly, God does not want these people to molest children or dogs, or murder their fellow humans seriatim.  Unless God is evil, which Helminiak already agrees he is not.  So Helminiak's argument falls apart because the principle he relies on is far from applicable to other other circumstances, other people.  To say God created man is not to say that God micromanages the creation and growth and daily actions of all people, or condones their poor choices and immoral actions.  Helminiak happily dispenses with reading scripture figuratively when it suits his purpose, but here seems to adhere to a level of literalness that I don't encounter outside of the strictest sort of fundamentalism.  He isn't consistent in his argumentation.  This is a book by an author who clearly knows ahead of time the conclusion he wants to arrive at, and seeks to find a way--any way--to get there.  He's not alone.  This isn't the only book I've read on the subject; the others make similar arguments, deliberately misinterpreting the koine Greek of the NT so that, in their minds, they can believe that when Paul condemns men who lay with men, what he is really condemning is men laying with male prostitutes, or boys.  But these interpretations are without foundation and fly in the face of the overwhelming bulk of biblical scholarship.  As an interesting insight into where Helminiak is coming from, consider what he has said in a PBS interview:  "I can remember the first time I deliberately went and had sex with someone. It was somebody I had known, who had approached me ... and I was being sympathetic because he's telling me he's gay... I thought God was happy that finally I got off my duff and did something. God said, 'Yay! Finally you're growing up! You're starting to live.'"  Say what?  An ordained minister of God, who has taken vows of obedience and celibacy, goes out, has sex with a man he met in his pastoral capacity, and God says "Yay!"?  Is this guy SERIOUS?  The Bible's prohibition against homosexual sex is not a cultural convention of an ancient people. The condemnations appear in Paul's vice lists.  Scripturally speaking, homosexual acts are, simply and unequivocally, vices to be avoided.  If you want to know what the Bible REALLY says about same-sex relationships, read the Bible, not Helminiak.   
 Undoubtedly the worst 'Best Of' DVD ever made, even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him as a gift.   There might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the actual DVD. There aren't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds. Shame on the band for putting this out. Obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'Best Of' on DVD.    This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture. My taped videos on VHS from MTV and VH1 sound and look better than these ones, really. This essay in amatuerism may have some interest.   For worse, is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90's to 2000. 'Love Is Blindness', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out. Didn't they have another filmed version of 'Gone'?. Mexico City 1997 was just a below average performance. Shame on U2 for keep going with 'Gone' from that bad shaped Bono's rough night. I still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song. Im talking about 'Until The End Of The World'. In case you dont know, THERES an actual video clip from that song. Rather, they just put the well known Sidney 1993 version here.  Rumors say they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage.   Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from the same Tour). Cheers   1- Belfast 23-01-1981 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  2- Berlin 04-11-1981 (Great Goncert)  3- New York 22-11-1981 (Good Concert)  4- Hattem 14-05-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  5- Roskilde 02-07-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  6- Devore 03-05-1983 (Great Concert)  7- St. Goarshausen 20-08-1983 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  8- Dortmund 21-11-1984 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  9- Montreal 27-03-1985 (Great Concert)  10-Los Angeles 18-11-1987 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  11-Dublin 31-12-1989 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  12-Stockholm 11-06-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  13-Washington 16-08-1992 (Great Concert)  14-Anaheim 14-11-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  15-Dublin 28-08-1993 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  16-Adelaide 16-11-1993 (Great Concert)  17-Rotterdam 18-07-1997 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  18-Sao Baulo 31-01-1998 (Great Concert)  19-Santiago 11-02-1998 (AWESOME CONCERT!)   What the hell are U2 waiting for?         
 The worst movie ever made. I actually sat through the whole thing hoping it would get better. The acting was beyond awful, the story was a joke. I honestly was blown away at how terrible it was, do NOT waste your money or time on this movie 
 This was one of the most influential books in modern history, but unfortunately for Western society, it was a pseudoscientific fraud. Mead claimed that women were dominant in the Tchambuli tribe, without causing problems. This statement was used as the intellectual cornerstone of the later Women's liberation movement. However, reliable modern references such as Encyclopedia Britannica make no mention of female dominance or power in those tribes, except for infrequent taboo ceremonies by female witches. (That tribe is also called Chambri or Chimbu in modern references.) Mead also described the Arapesh people as pacifist, cooperative, happy folks, and that was used by later Columbia University students such as Kerouac and Ginsberg as the philosphical basis of the Hippy Revolution. Modern references describe the Arapesh as having been just as competitive and warlike as other primitive peoples. (See also "The Samoa Reader" by Hiram Caton.) 
 This a wonderful book to read to children or to read yourself.  It tells the history of this Country of Ours in story form.  This makes the reading of it very fun and exiting.  The book also includes some wonderful drawings in color.  Don't miss.  It will make you proud to be an American 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 I've owned both editions and I totally agree with previous reviewers about preferring the original version. The older version analyzes one book ("The Accidental Tourist") that is easy to get new or used, and won't eat too significantly into time you should be writing instead of reading. The newer version analyzes several books which starts to look more like a book on literary criticism rather than on the writing process. The original is much more process-oriented, since the goal of the reader of this specific book is to get words on the page, not just broaden the amount of novels on the shelf.   Overall, I was disappointed. I thought the newer version was long-winded with lots of unnecessary filler that hindered more than helped. Get the original. It's worth it 
 I have read one of theother books written by this author, and loved them, so I thought I would read this one as well.  The story was very good.  The wording was put a little too simply, but it was an overall good book.  It kept me interested, and I didn't put it down until I was done.  The only problem was that it was very short, and ended too abruptly.  The story didn't exactly end.  I would have liked to hear more about what happens to The Moochers.  Seeing some sort of conflict would have been nice 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 The book starts out promising, with the first chapter being a very good quick intro to CMS and Plone and the types of things that CMS can do for you.  However, once you start getting into the specifics, it quickly become clear that this book is now outdated.  Many of the examples are hard to follow because the current version of Plone has different options or features.  Also, the examples cover only the "low hanging fruit" - the easiest of tasks, many of which you can figure out on your own just by sitting in front of a browser and navigating Plone using common sense.  (Which I ended up having to do, since the examples in the book are outdated.)  You won't find the real-world answers you need in this book.  Need to authenticate the users based on some authentication you already have, such as LDAP?  This isn't the book for you.  Only 1 page is dedicated to user and group admin, and that is basically a rehash of what you see on the screen in that admin panel.  Want to know how to allow users to publish their own work rather than wait for the admin to approve it?  Not in the book, you have to just figure it out by experimenting.     This book does have its moments but a large portion of it is easy to learn just by playing with Plone on your own 
 This book is not anywhere near the level of Bruce Bawer's While Europe Slept and Melanie Phillips' Londonistan, on the same general topic, the Islamization of Europe. Berlinski's writing is really a series of intermittently readable would-be magazine articles that, alas, were bound between book covers. In contrast to Bawer's book which skillfully ties each chapter to the Moslem problem in Europe, Berlinski fails to communicate with a unified voice and point of view. When she insisted at one point that she is definitely not saying most Moslems are disloyal, she lost me. Phillips wrote, on the contrary, that the evidence suggests most British Moslems support the terrorists. In the chapter on interfaith efforts by the mayor of Marseilles, Berlinski actually asks the mayor if his exclusion of an extremist imam from membership in the council is at odds with the spirit of the interfaith program. The mayor naturally took umbrage, and Berlinski failed to realize why her question was impertinent. She doesn't seem to know what she stands for, and neither does the reader. 
 I was very excited to hear that this new Muppets Holiday offering was coming!  The previous two Christmas albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver & "A Muppet Christmas Carol") have long been family favorites at hour house in December.  However, this time I am disappointed.  Most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous.  I realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us.  But, to focus on these voices so much (Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Statler & Waldorf, The Swedish Chef) in this album, only produces a disappointing reminder that the "Muppets" we grew up with are long gone.  Maybe I am being a little hard on this cd.  But, there are plenty of Muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices (Robin, Sam, Honeydew & Beaker, Rizzo, Louzeland, etc).  Those voices added to those of Ganzo, Miss Piggy and Fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel.  There are a couple of good cuts on the album.  One is "Merry Christmas" by Pepe.  The other is "Santa Baby" by Miss Piggy.  Sadly, over all I can not recommend this cd. 
 For me, it barely looked like I had mascara on at all.  I have blonde eyelashes, so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop, and this didn't really.  I ended up giving it to my mom, thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it, and she didn't like it either.  It ended up in the garbage.  I've loved Dior Show mascara and of course, Great Lash.  I'd recommend those over this, especially for the money 
  In this book Bash Dibra, the self-styled "dog trainer to the stars," recounts some of his experiences raising and training an actual wolf.  You'd think this would lend a great deal of credence to Dibra's training techniques and to his retelling of the now discredited alpha theory, which states that the social instincts of dogs and wolves is based on who's most dominant within the pack's hierarchical structure.  But since this book was initially published in the early 1990s, it's now totally out of date and off-base, at least from a theoretical standpoint.  For instance early in the book Dibra says, "You should take the alpha role with your puppy early or he will always try to dominate you."  But the top wolf experts don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because, as David Mech puts it, "It falsely implies a hierarchical system in which a wolf assumes a place in a linear pecking order."  (Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2002.)  Mech has also stated that in wild wolves "dominance displays are uncommon."  So how can you "play the alpha role" with your puppy if there is no such thing as alpha?  And why would a puppy always try to dominate you if dominance displays are rare in nature?    Why the disparity?  Because it turns out that the alpha theory was based on studies done on wolves kept captive in sanctuaries, not on the behavior of actual wild wolf packs, who behave in a more cooperative and harmonic manner than captive wolves (or most dominance trainers) do.  Dibra also says that training a dog to lie down on command is difficult because lying down is a submissive posture and dogs never want to be submissive.  There are two flaws in the logic here: First of all, the posture for the obedience "down" -- lyiing with the spinal column in a straight line, head up -- is radicallly different from a submissive down -- rolling over on one side and putting a back leg up in the air.  That posture would not win points at an obedience trial!  Meanwhile, Patricia Gail Burnham, in PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG, says that she saves the down for last because it's too EASY.  Again, why the disparity?  The other flaw in Dibra's logic: if dogs always want to dominate and never be submissive, and training them is about showing that YOU'RE dominant, doesn't that describe an ongoing, unending battle between you and your dog's instincts?  Does that sound healthy, happy, and productive?  Wouldn't it be better to find a way -- as Pat Burnham, Kevin Behan, and others do -- to work WITH your dog's instincts and not be constantly battling them?  With that said, there ARE some good bits of training advice here: don't rush the training process, give your dog lots of vigorous exercise, etc.  Just keep far, far away from anything that smacks of dominance...the logic of that approach no longer makes any sense 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 An album of anodyne wallpaper-drivel: hypermanufactured in every worst sense. Fine, there's nothing wrong with the songs; it's just that all colour has been cloyingly bleached out of them. Tempi are uniformly slow, accompaniments, saccharine-coated, and the lyrics so indulgently mauled as to render them ironically sterile. What persuaded first-class musicians like Stephen Schwartz to have anything to do with this tedious project? Even the booklet looks like a second-rate ad promotion for a hotel chain. 'In Good Company?' Frankly, I'd rather be in on my own 
 I don't understand what so special about this book. The first half of the book is quite exciting. But in the later half - especially towards the ending - it becomes complicated, boring, almost incomprehensible.  The restaurant part of the story is so unnecessary and has nothing (or just a little bit) to do with the main storyline. The 'Olive doing her carvings and sticking pins on wax figures' constantly repeated and has nothing to do with the storyline. The conclusion is very confusing. We can never be so sure why the killer killed.  Sorry......this book is not good enough.   take Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine anyday....... 
 As to the people commenting on the below reviews being self-promotion, let me just say that I work in a chain-bookstore which has recently been hit by a plague of special orders for this book by a person whose address and phone number don't really exist. The book in non-returnable to the publisher, so we are stuck with it on our shelves. I'll let you try to figure out for yourself who that person might be 
 I feel they should have called this movie "Punisher and Friends". Yes, I loved how they had the punisher move into his new apartment and make friends with his quirky and lovable neighbors. He even joined them for dinner, but still remembered to keep a frown on his face(he's still hell bent on vengeance you see). It was also great how the villains were able to do battle with him by simply driving to his apartment, how convenient. But what truly made this movie legend was the deeply moving dramatic performances of Rebecca Romijn, especially that scene where she is attempting to portray an actress crying near the end of the movie. I love when I feel embarrassed for an actor when they are attempting to perform. And the Popsicle torture gag was simply delightful (wink,wink,nudge,nudge). You silly punisher, even though your life has been senselessly destroyed you still know how to play a good practical joke. I was so excited to see this movie, but I was simply orgasmic when I realized how much they had watered the story down and turned it into Punisher Lite 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 Really, I hate to use such an overused phrase as the title for my review, but coming up with something clever is really more than this book deserves. You'd think it'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot. You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Instead you'd be left saying, "Jon Stewart, my man, you liked this? Seriously? Are you high? No, wait don't answer that, it's all becoming abundantly clear to me now." 
 I have three highly gifted children. None of them are interested in reading this book 
 If you buy this CD just to hear some good music, or some good dnb or whateva, then your wrong. I read from some reviews that it was supposed to be dark. Well, I didn't need the flashlight I bought with me after all to  listen. Maybe the reviewers just heard it during some polar night, but for  me it's just another one of those "old-sounding" dnb albums. And  one more thing. If you think that light(/airy/mellodic) dnb is fast then  your mistaken again. 'Cause this album is despite it's lightness slow as a  snail. No fun 
 The [money] I spent on this book was a waste. The arthur used his reputation to peddle a inferior book on training. The book may work in middle schools, but one could easily find more in depth articles online and in journals. Very little is given in terms of theory or application and more emphasis is given to rudimentary biological processes. I find this book to be a complete waste of a few hours better spent elsewhere 
 NOVA isn't what it used to be.  The BBC Series "The Planets" contains much of the same subject matter, presented more accurately with interviews of more relevant people 
 I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time, which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled, no matter where you find them sold. However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon, namely the Pouch Trunk Underware, and "A" style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered. I wear a medium size (32" waist medium build) and purchased the same in both products. And both of these products are "painfully small" after laundered. I tried to wear them anyway, hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on. But they were just uncomfortably too short, and tight. By the way, I laundered them in cold water, just like I do all my clothing 
 Ugh. An unfunny waste of an hour and a half. Even the DVD Menu Screen is painfully annnoying. This film boasts 2 awards on its cover, one for Best Film at the Vail Film Festival and one for Best Actress in the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. It is so bad that henceforth, mention of either of those two festivals will be a Black Flag when I'm deciding what not to watch. Before the third act even started, I emailed the good people at the Vail Film Festival to find out what other films were there in 2004, when this won, because I'm a masochist and I'm utterly fascinated to find out-- and yes, ultimately watch-- the kind of trash this movie could have possibly beaten. They have yet to reply. I can only hope that if Andy Richter knew this was the kind of work he'd be doing, he would have shackled himself to Conan's desk "Saw"-style. I had a running debate with myself whether Bryan Cranston's character's obnoxious foreign accent was in the script or if he added it in a futile attempt to spice things up. Said debate was far more entertaining than the film. Highlights for me were two moments of sheer confusion and panic which required me to look up the cast credits online to reassure myself of my own sanity: "Dear God, is that Supergirl?" and "Dear God, is that the lead singer of Korn?" Other than that, the best feeling this movie gave me was relief, when the end credits started to roll less than 90 minutes after the opening credits. Not only do I wish I could assign a score of zero stars, I wish a mechanism existed which would allow me to take away the stars given to this film by other reviewers and dispense those stars equally among Gigli, Empire Records, Catwoman, and Tom Green's filmography in its entirety 
 I unfortunately could not get through this book. T.R just went on and on, getting a bit carried away with his own wit and literary skills. I wish  I could write a better review, but I can't get past the second chapter. Perhaps further on down the road I will give it another try. In the meantime I recommend all Tom's other novels. 
 This got to be the most egotistical and arrogant book ever writted. The author in about every paragraph, uses words like "I", "me" and when refering to another person and himself, he always puts his name first. Bhagwati loves to name drop, he lists people he has met as if its a popularity contest. Bhagwati's writting will confuse you and annoy you. Throught out the book he loves to advertise the papers and studies he has written, they have no relavence to the topic at hand except maybe to help him sell more books 
 First off, a little background. I'm a 3'd year technology student, this book was the forces (*cough *cough), assigned material for one of my classes.   About the book. It covers many important topics related to the mechanical engineering field. As such it is a pretty handy source of reference, and can be used to quicky refresh one's memory in a particular subject.   The writing style of this book however, is very poor. It is boring, hard to follow and the examples provided are repetitive and do not explain a lot of things. I once voiced my complaint about the book to our professor, to which i got the following response. "Well, this book was written for the university level". If following a university level book is supposed to take more effort than understanding the actual subject matter, then i guess Mr Norton has done his job 
 Beloved is one of the most famous novels by Toni Morrison, America's only female to win the Nobel Prize in literature.  Set in the America before the Civil War, the story moves from the slave South to the non-slave North.  Free the North is not, as this book depicts, for slaves could be captured and returned down South.  The book is conglomeration of multiple themes and storylines.  First and foremost is the story of Sethe, a black woman who used to be a slave.  Second, the book focuses on her baby who died at birth, who goes by the name Beloved, and the reappearance of the baby as a ghost.    Third, the book examines slavery, racism, and the politics of inclusion and seclusion.  In the South, Sethe is excluded from civil society in many ways by her color and the institution of slavery, but being a slave, is an integral part of society in general.  In the North, she is not a slave per say, but instead she is excluded from society in general by the ways of white people and their benign racism.  The storylines of this book also explore the physical punishments and practices used to enforce slavery at the personal level.  Here is where this book stands out from others like it like Uncle Tom's Cabin or Huck Finn.  This book could be described as doing for black literature on slavery as what Passion of the Christ did for movies based on the Bible.  it is quite graphic with big servings of the natural thrown in.  But I would not use this book as a study of slavery and the racism built into it.  The text is very confusing and I, the reader, spent much time trying to understand the entity of Beloved, and its use in furthering the story.  In fact, I would call this book a tragedy not about slavery and racism, but a tragedy set against the backdrop of slavery and racism.  Overall, a difficult book to read and though not boring, is not on my list of great American works 
 Inane, useless information from a speaker so boring I could hardly get through the 3 CD's (but felt like I had to since I had spent the money on them).   Perhaps he is a great salesperson-but I cannot see it.  I bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box.  I think this information was aimed at someone in grade school, not a professional sales person.  
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 As the other reviewer mentioned, the stats are all wrong in this book, some of the units listed aren't even named the same. Before publishing this book, did the editor even bother to check for accuracy or conform to the stats in the final game?? In addition there are so many typos and mislabels and erroneous info that it's ridiculous, did anyone even check this book prior to publishing?   This is nothing more than an appendix of wrong info, there is little to no discussion of strategy, of how to use individual units, what tactics to use on the battlefield, how to manage mix of castles/cities, etc. This book is worthless, having played the game for a couple of weeks, I can write a better strategy guide than this piece of junk
